<p>A while ago a friend lent me an excellent anthology: <strong><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6310843-the-darker-sex" target="_blank">The Darker Sex: Tales of the Supernatural and Macabre by Victorian Women Writers</a></strong>. It sounded so far up my street I expected to find it waiting for me on the doorstep as I scurried home to read it.</p>
<p>As you might imagine, it includes a lot of creepy old mansions, brave governesses, and ghostly women wandering around in white gowns. I love that stuff. But towards the back I was delighted to discover something unusual: a Marxist Feminist vampire story.</p>
<p>The story was <strong><a title="LitGothic - Luella" href="http://www.litgothic.com/Texts/luella.html" target="_blank">Luella Miller</a></strong>, published in <a title="Mary Wilkins Freeman" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Eleanor_Wilkins_Freeman" target="_blank">Mary Wilkins Freeman</a>&#8216;s 1903 short story collection <strong><a title="The Wind In The Rosebush, 1903" href="http://www.donaldcorrell.com/mwilkins/windbush.html" target="_blank">The Wind In The Rose Bush</a></strong>. While the events are definitely supernatural, Luella is more of a metaphorical than literal vampire, mesmerising and leeching the life force from her victims by draining their energy rather than their blood.</p>
<p>Her fellow townsfolk, men and women, old and young, literally work themselves to death in her service. One after another they become obsessed with caring for her, doing her washing and sewing, cooking her meals, making her coffee, working until they become ill and eventually die, when they are replaced by another willing servant.</p>
<p>The story is narrated several decades on by Lydia Anderson, the last person alive who knew Luella; she didn&#8217;t succumb to her mysterious power. As Lydia puts it: &#8220;There was somethin&#8217; about Luella Miller seemed to draw the heart right out of you, but she didn&#8217;t draw it out of <em>me</em>.&#8221; She tells the story of all the people whom Luella drained of life, including her sister-in-law Lily:</p>
<blockquote><p>This Lily Miller had been hardly past her first youth, and a most robust and blooming woman, rosy-cheeked, with curls of strong, black hair overshadowing round, candid temples and bright dark eyes. It was not six months after she had taken up her residence with her sister-in-law that her rosy colour faded and her pretty curves became wan hollows. White shadows began to show in the black rings of her hair, and the light died out of her eyes, her features sharpened, and there were pathetic lines at her mouth, which yet wore always an expression of utter sweetness and even happiness. She was devoted to her sister; there was no doubt that she loved her with her whole heart, and was perfectly content in her service. It was her sole anxiety lest she should die and leave her alone&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;all the time Luella wa&#8217;n&#8217;t liftin&#8217; her finger and poor Lily didn&#8217;t get any care except what the neighbours gave her, and Luella eat up everythin&#8217; that was carried in for Lily. I had it real straight that she did. Luella used to just sit and cry and do nothin&#8217;. She did act real fond of Lily, and she pined away considerable, too. There was those that thought she&#8217;d go into a decline herself. But after Lily died, her Aunt, Abby Mixter came, and then Luella picked up and grew as fat and rosy as ever.</p></blockquote>
<p>Unlike many fictional vampires, Luella does not seem to intend any harm against her victims. She is indifferent, almost oblivious. Her supernatural ability to enslave her neighbours does not seem to be within her control; instead, it is more like a poisonous vapour that surrounds her, simultaneously enchanting and slowly destroying them.</p>
<p>Another interesting aspect of the story is the emphasis on Luella&#8217;s infantile need. It is not simply that she will not care for herself, forcing others to look after her, but that she <em>cannot</em>. She is entirely helpless, so that when the town finally begins to keep its distance, she herself begins to weaken.</p>
<p>In her article <a title="Dreadful Yet Irresistable" href="http://www.inter-disciplinary.net/ati/fht/fht2/nakagawa%20paper.pdf" target="_blank">Dreadful Yet Irresistible Luella Miller: Horror in the Absence of Self</a> (PDF), Chiho Nakagawa sees Luella Miller as a feminist parable about the suppression of agency and independence in the feminine ideal taken to it&#8217;s logical, monstrous, conclusion:</p>
<blockquote><p>By spreading her dependency and helplessness into others, Luella makes others experience her dreadful state&#8230; Functioning as an addictive substance, Luella Miller lets us see how fearful it is to be a feminine woman without her own self.</p></blockquote>

<p>I think this is an interesting take, as if Luella exists only as an object of others&#8217; self destructive love, with no subjective self, no agency or control. It is this that makes her state &#8220;dreadful&#8221;. She is parasitic, overwhelming and consuming her host, but unable to survive without them.</p>
<p>Without the contrasting courage, agency and practicality of &#8220;hale and hearty&#8221; 87 year old narrator Lydia Anderson, the story could seem to be a misogynist attack on wealthy women.</p>
<p>But  I agree with Lynda L. Hinkle and her paper <a title="Hinkle" href="http://academinist.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/hinkle1.pdf" target="_blank">Bloodsucking Structures: American Female Vampires as Class Structure Critique</a>, when she describes the story as: &#8220;a stinging critique of a declining but still prevalent social class structure that churned out a large, useless upper class of women whose job it was to be beautiful and consume.&#8221;</p>
<p>I read the story as a comment on the economic and social structures which manufactured useless creatures like Luella, wealthy women who were prevented from acquiring ideas, skills, purpose or independence. The same structures, while fetishising helplessness as the supreme feminine virtue on the one hand, forced countless other women (and men) to work themselves into an early grave in the service of their betters.</p>

<p><strong>CONTENT NOTE:</strong> Discussions herein of sexual assault, dubious consent, mental health treated badly, homophobia, biphobia and slut-shaming. Oh, and plenty of spoilers.</p>
<p>Welcome back to <strong>Hopeless Reimantic Presents</strong>! <a href="/2013/12/04/hopeless-reimantic-presents-anita-blake-vampire-hunter-part-one" target="_blank">Last time we got our teeth into <strong>Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter</strong></a>, and I found myself actually saying some pretty positive things about the books. (Honestly, I&#8217;m as surprised as you. My fourteen-year-old self is throwing one hell of a sulk.) It&#8217;s not the full story, though, and there&#8217;s still quite a lot about this series to unpack.</p>
<p>First of all, there&#8217;s something I need to make clear: as I said in <a href="/2013/12/04/hopeless-reimantic-presents-anita-blake-vampire-hunter-part-one" target="_blank">Part One</a>, I went into this review determined not to talk about the series in relation to Laurell K. Hamilton herself more than was necessary.</p>
<p>I generally hold that unless an author has done something that I can&#8217;t reconcile myself to morally, I don&#8217;t feel like it&#8217;s my business to talk about their personal life when I am supposed to be reviewing their books. And from what I&#8217;ve read of Laurell K. Hamilton&#8217;s blog posts, she seems kind of entitled and I find her annoying, but&#8230;well, let&#8217;s just say that as far as I can tell she&#8217;s no Orson Scott Card. By and large my problems with the ideas she puts across can easily be expressed in criticism of her work rather than criticism of her.</p>
<p>I ran into some problems with this approach, to be sure; the evidence for Anita Blake being the author&#8217;s avatar is pretty compelling. But for the purposes of analysing the text, I&#8217;m putting that debate to bed. From here on out, guys, they&#8217;re just books, so if anyone is reading this expecting it to be a catalogue of Ms Hamilton&#8217;s character flaws, well, it&#8217;s not going to be. Hashtag sorry not sorry, or something.</p>
<p>Oh, one more thing: I&#8217;m limiting myself to a maximum of one book quotation per point here, because SEVENTEEN BOOKS LORD HAVE MERCY.</p>
<p>Okay! Let&#8217;s get started. Where were we? Was I wanting to tear my eyes out? I think I was wanting to tear my eyes out.</p>
<p>&#8230;I&#8217;m going to need to slip into a more concise format, I think, or that&#8217;s just going to be the entire article. Here, then, in no particular order, are My Main Problems with Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter:</p>
<h3>1) Anita only has one dating experience that I would describe as fully consensual.</h3>
<p>She dates Richard, a werewolf, and then she gets engaged to Richard, and <em>then</em> the vampire she&#8217;s been hanging out with decides that he needs &#8220;equal time&#8221; to win her over, or he&#8217;s got no choice but to duel Richard to the death:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;You have dated him for months, and I have said little. Before you marry him, I want equal time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been trying to avoid you for months. I&#8217;m not just going to give in now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I will start the music, and we will dance. Even if I die, and you die. Richard will die first, I can promise you that. Surely dating me is not a fate worse than death.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8211; Laurell K. Hamilton, <strong>The Lunatic Cafe</strong>, p.221.</p></blockquote>
<p>(I&#8217;m not so sure about that, dude.)</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also the shapeshifter leopard who basically just rapes her (it&#8217;s okay, she enjoys it) and then is her mate and it&#8217;s all fine, and the other shapeshifter leopard who is Terrifyingly Submissive at her until she gives in (more on that later). These are her four main men and, last I checked, the various loves of her life.</p>
<p>There are a couple of things at play here, and I can intellectually grasp them both. One is that an easy way to add darkness and tension to a story is to have your main character interact with a world which doesn&#8217;t recognise their morality, which is how we get all those kind of racist &#8220;I was ravished by a barbarian/sheikh/otherwise rich and dark-skinned man&#8221; stories (remind me to talk to you about <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2180276.The_Panther_and_the_Pearl" target="_blank"><strong>The Panther And The Pearl</strong></a> some time). And that&#8217;s not necessarily a bad thing in a fantasy world where you are dealing with beings that might have witnessed the greater part of human history. I do take the point that you might well not care so much about pesky human morals when you&#8217;ve been living off blood or sex or male tears or whatever for about a thousand years.</p>
<p>And, credit where it&#8217;s due, Laurell K. Hamilton does make some effort to deal with the effect this is having on Anita; she agonises, at least initially, over the detachment she feels from her humanity as she gets drawn deeper into the preternatural world. Hamilton doesn&#8217;t really take that conflict anywhere, which is a shame because it makes the whole thing feel a bit too insta-conflict for my liking, but she tries.</p>
<p>The considerably more disturbing thing is the second point, which is that this is supposed to be <em>hot</em>. We&#8217;ve touched on this before in <a href="/2013/04/23/hopeless-reimantic-3-pack-mentality/" target="_blank">the column on alpha males</a>, but one thing that I think I missed there is actually what I find grossest about this particular fantasy &#8211; that being threatened or coerced, either physically or by other means, into being with someone is supposed to be evidence of part of a woman&#8217;s power and mystique. It&#8217;s not that these guys are proto-rapists, no &#8211; it&#8217;s that women are so damned irresistible that they overwhelm men&#8217;s judgement and common sense. Basically, they are the full moon to every man&#8217;s <a href="http://pervocracy.blogspot.co.uk/2012/08/the-myth-of-boner-werewolf.html" target="_blank">boner werewolf</a> (link NSFW).</p>
<p>There is an element of pick-up artistry that states that when you overcome LMR (last minute resistance, usually to sex) you&#8217;re actually doing the woman a favour, because you&#8217;re taking the responsibility out of her hands. She can&#8217;t be a slut, because she&#8217;s not in control; you&#8217;re preserving her purity while still giving her the sex she wants. That is gross and messed-up and a terrible bit of rape apologia, but it&#8217;s the same kind of logic that I&#8217;m seeing here; it&#8217;s a way to skirt around having Anita own her own sexuality. She can&#8217;t help it! She&#8217;s just got this <em>energy</em>!</p>
<p>And on that note&#8230;</p>
<h3>2) There&#8217;s hella slut-shaming.</h3>
<p>It took me a while to realise this. I started out with <strong>Danse Macabre</strong>, but the more of these books I read, the more I became convinced that having lots of sex was only okay for Anita Blake, and by extension her harem of men, because Anita Blake has sex because she somehow <em>has</em> to &#8211; which is a pretty icky sentence to begin with, by the way. </p>
<p>Anita starts out the series not believing in pre-marital sex. She ends up having quite a lot of it, but there&#8217;s never a sense that she revises that belief, which would be really interesting if it didn&#8217;t have such weird implications for the other women in the books. Anita has sex because of deep love, a deep sense of obligation (erk) and/or because she is a succubus. Metaphysical events or very strong emotion compel her to bone, and the fact that she ends up enjoying it immensely is somehow a coincidence, which is possibly the strangest permutation of the forced seduction trope I&#8217;ve ever seen. </p>
<p>And even that would be okay, were it not for the fact that every single other woman in the books who has sex for such a frivolous reason as the fact she just enjoys it is painted as either a) shallow and heinous, b) mentally unstable, or c) both.</p>
<p>Which brings me neatly to:</p>
<h3>3) There is gratuitous use of mental illness as a plot device.</h3>
<p>Basically every villain is crazy. And there&#8217;s Nathaniel, her second shapeshifter love interest, who is super-submissive and utterly traumatised by his past and hey, did we mention he&#8217;s kinky too and can take more pain than anybody else? Because he&#8217;s damaged?</p>
<p>Urgh. If I had to hazard, I&#8217;d say this follows a lot of the same logic that we see in point 1), but let&#8217;s just be honest here; this isn&#8217;t just offensive, it&#8217;s lazy writing, in the same way that blaming serious criminal offences or terrorism on mental illness is lazy journalism. It&#8217;s a way to avoid grappling seriously with what could actually be some pretty compelling issues and it&#8217;s depressing me. So let&#8217;s move on to our final point:</p>
<h3>4) Gender essentialism and homophobia.</h3>
<p>Hoo boy.</p>
<p>This is a pretty interesting one, actually, because the characters around Anita Blake actually call her on some of it, and it doesn&#8217;t work. I skipped a quotation for mental illness and point 2, so we can have two in here because it&#8217;s my column and I make the rules.</p>
<p>I feel like I need to include this one because it&#8217;s in <strong>Shutdown</strong>, which was actually only released <a href="http://www.laurellkhamilton.org/2013/10/shutdown-press-release/" target="_blank">a few weeks ago</a> &#8211; and, again, in fairness to Ms Hamilton, releasing it the way she did was a nice idea (it was a freebie because of the US government shutdown, in solidarity with government workers who were off without pay). </p>
<p>The story itself is interesting purely because the premise is so flawed: Richard, Anita Blake&#8217;s erstwhile lover, now-Top, is engaged to another woman, and apparently has chosen only now to mention to her that he&#8217;s poly and wants to see other people for wild kinky sex. His fiancee has a problem with this &#8211; not, you understand, because somehow <em>they have got as far as being engaged without this ever having come up</em>, but because she&#8217;s a crazy jealous harpy who can&#8217;t wrap her narrow mind around non-monogamy or sex that isn&#8217;t vanilla. </p>
<p>I liked precisely nobody in this short, but Anita least of all:</p>
<blockquote><p>I hadn&#8217;t had to endure this much small talk in years. We&#8217;d learned a lot about one another, but unless we were looking to date, I didn&#8217;t see the point.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Men understood that sometimes you didn&#8217;t want to smile, but you weren&#8217;t mad either, while women expect other women to be pleasant, and if you&#8217;re not they think you don&#8217;t like them. There are so many reasons that most of my friends are men. </p>
<p>&#8211; Laurell K. Hamilton, <strong>Shutdown</strong>, pp.6-8</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh, Ms Blake, you charmer. I could quote this little piece all day, actually, because it shows you a lot about the mess of contradictions that is gender portrayal in these books, but &#8211; you guys, I can&#8217;t. I just can&#8217;t. I think my brain is leaking out of my ears.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s finish up, then, with one final quote, and my witty and insightful riposte.</p>
<p>Look, okay, this isn&#8217;t even close to the most homophobia I&#8217;ve ever seen in fiction, or the worst. I&#8217;ll give you that I really do think this was&#8230; misguided, but well-intentioned. For what that&#8217;s worth. But the fact remains that I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve seen a non-heterosexual character in the Anita Blake series who wasn&#8217;t sex-obsessed, mentally ill (see above) and/or just plain old mean. </p>
<p>Anita Blake herself later gets a girlfriend and starts identifying as &#8220;heteroflexible&#8221;, which is a completely valid label that I don&#8217;t wish to detract from, but in this case reads to me sort of like she&#8217;s just started adding &#8220;no homo&#8221; to the end of all of her sentences about fancying women.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s&#8230;well, this. For context: some of Anita&#8217;s male partners are bisexual. She has just had a threesome with one of them and another man, which she feels gives her incontrovertible proof that he is, in fact, also into guys. The other men around her do not seem bothered by this revelation. Which prompts the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In college I had a friend, a girlfriend, a girl who was a friend. She and I went shopping together. Slept over at each other&#8217;s dorm rooms. I undressed in front of her because she was a girl. Then toward the end of college she told me she was gay. We were still friends, but she went into that guy category for me. You don&#8217;t undress in front of people who see you as a sex object. You don&#8217;t sleep with them, or&#8230;oh, hell.&#8221; I looked up at Micah. &#8220;Won&#8217;t it weird you out to sleep nude beside him now?&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8211; Laurell K. Hamilton, <strong>Danse Macabre</strong>, p.188.</p></blockquote>
<p>Funny story: my original response to this paragraph was a lot more colourful. I&#8217;m going to try and discuss it briefly, coherently and without expletives.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure which bothers me more, here: the idea that being attracted to members of one gender means you&#8217;re attracted to <em>all</em> members of one gender, or Anita&#8217;s assumption that everybody around her is going to have the same weird hang-ups as she is. I will say, though, that reading this made me briefly see red. You can come hang out with my friends, Anita Blake&#8217;s token lesbian college friend! They&#8217;ll hug you! Even the straight women!</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m struggling to articulate is why, exactly, this paragraph was the exact point that I fully lost patience with the series, because in context it&#8217;s not actually so bad. Anita is laughed at for her small-mindedness, and they all go to sleep naked and it&#8217;s fine.</p>
<p>Except&#8230;</p>
<p>Except that <em>this never really goes away</em>. There&#8217;s a kind of false normal here that you&#8217;re not supposed to stray from, and then even when Anita does, all that happens it that it gets this veneer of &#8220;exotic sexy sex stuff&#8221; that makes the books transgressive and naughty. It doesn&#8217;t read like a straight-up sex fantasy. I definitely don&#8217;t buy that it&#8217;s an honest exploration of sexuality in fiction. I&#8217;m not even sure that it&#8217;s Laurell K. Hamilton bragging about her sex life with extra fantasy elements.</p>
<p>The best way I can describe it is that it reads like a zoo exhibit, if people who have a lot of sex could actually literally <em>be</em> zoo exhibits. It doesn&#8217;t challenge normative attitudes, is what I&#8217;m saying. It takes the stuff Ms Hamilton describes as &#8220;too underground for the mainstream&#8221; and sticks it behind a thick layer of societal assumptions-reinforced glass, so that you can look at it without getting your brain too into all the sex stuff. And then you can go home at the end feeling like you&#8217;ve learned something. And perhaps a little icky.</p>
<p>And that brings us to the end of <strong>Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter</strong>. If you enjoyed this column and want me to do more like it, consider dropping me a comment, because the experience was&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;it was&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;it&#8217;s been an experience, guys. And now, if you&#8217;ll excuse me, I&#8217;m off to read something else. Something gentle, with no sex in it whatsoever. Maybe some Catherynne M. Valente.</p>
<p>See you next time!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[When the call came around for horror-themed posts for autumn and winter, I decided to take on the Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter series.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Early December. The leaves have fallen, the sky has darkened. Rain lashes the windows. Doors yawn open before you; blackness whispers chill secrets into your hair, and your worst nightmares take shape &#8216;twixt the smoky trees, taunting, menacing. Waiting.</p>
<p>Basically, at the time of writing it was the month with Hallowe&#8217;en in it, and I hate to waste a perfectly good theme. So without further ado, allow me to welcome you to <strong>Hopeless Reimantic Presents</strong>! In this column I&#8217;ll be going in-depth into the works of specific authors who are in &#8211; or cross over into &#8211; the romance genre. In the spirit of the season, I thought we&#8217;d take a look at the stuff of nightmares: let&#8217;s talk about Laurell K. Hamilton. More specifically, let&#8217;s talk about <strong>Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter</strong>, one of the weirdest and most controversial series I&#8217;ve ever interacted with.</p>

(Via Marvel Wiki.)</p></div>
<p>First of all, a slightly complicated preface. Before I ever picked up an Anita Blake book I knew quite a lot about them, and while I&#8217;d like to stress that I&#8217;m here to talk about the <em></em>books and <em>not</em> Ms Hamilton herself I feel like I&#8217;ll be remiss if I don&#8217;t at least give a quick summary of some common controversies surrounding the series and its author.</p>
<p>I first became aware of Laurell K. Hamilton via Anne Rice. Well, not Anne Rice herself, but <a href="http://www.journalfen.net/community/fandom_wank/515245.html?nc=911" target="_blank">the now-infamous Anne Rice Author Tantrum</a>, which I arrived at a couple of years after the fact and consequently saw linked to&#8230;Laurell K. Hamilton&#8217;s <a href="http://eragon-sporkings.wikispaces.com/Hamiltons_Response_To_Negative_Readers" target="_blank">similarly poor handling of criticism</a> (link to a Wikispace article, as the original blog post has vanished).</p>
<p>Hamilton isn&#8217;t quite as vitriolic in her I Can&#8217;t Believe Not Everyone Likes My Book-ness, but she&#8217;s still pretty irritatingly condescending, although I do agree with her that if someone&#8217;s taking their book up to you so that you can sign it, then opening with &#8220;I hated this one and what you&#8217;ve done with the series&#8221; is kind of poor form.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s since made a name for herself on Twitter for calling her critics <a href="https://twitter.com/LKHamilton/status/200273311530360832" target="_blank">sexually frustrated</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/LKHamilton/status/200272147720056832" target="_blank">jealous</a> <a href="http://lkh-lashouts.livejournal.com/562684.html#cutid1" target="_blank">wannabes</a>, and a name for herself among readers and other writers for<a href="http://mybookgoggles.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/authors-behaving-badly-laurell-k.html" target="_blank"> not handling criticism well </a>and <a href="http://www.likesbooks.com/cgi-bin/bookReview.pl?BookReviewId=9647" target="_blank">shamelessly inserting herself into her books</a>. The <a href="http://lkh-lashouts.livejournal.com/" target="_blank">LKH_lashouts</a> community on LiveJournal keeps a nice catalogue of her various posts, blogs and misdemeanours, and I&#8217;ve been on it all day, which might explain why my brain is starting to feel too heavy for my skull.</p>
<p>As a lot of you probably aren&#8217;t familiar with what makes the Anita Blake series so divisive in the first place, I&#8217;ll give you a quick, neutral description to start us off (don&#8217;t worry, we&#8217;ll get to the incoherent ranting later). The <strong>Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter</strong> series started out as a kind of monster-of-the-week dealio, with some romance in it but not a huge deal. The romantic &#8211; and sexual &#8211; content of the books got a lot more page time as the series went on, and the tenth book in the series, <strong>Narcissus In Chains</strong>, saw a metaphysical event turn Anita Blake into a succubus who needs sex to survive.</p>
<p>Subsequent books are arguably more &#8220;paranormal erotica&#8221; than anything else, and the last time I checked in with Ms Blake she was in a polyamorous relationship with five guys and happy as a clam. This, and the fact that a lot of the events of Anita Blake&#8217;s love life seem to mirror the author&#8217;s, have led to accusations that Laurell K. Hamilton is using Anita to brag about how much sex she&#8217;s having, and have turned a lot of readers off the series.</p>
<p>The upshot of all this is that this time three months ago, your intrepid romance novel enthusiast knew <em>of</em> Laurell K. Hamilton and had formed a pretty strong impression of the <strong>Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter</strong> books &#8211; but had never actually picked one up. So when the call came around for horror-themed posts for autumn and winter, and I decided to take them on, I was&#8230;nervous, but excited. Here was a series with a strong female lead which had lost popularity as the erotic content had upped and the quality of the writing had deteriorated &#8211; the stuff of feminist bad-porn-lovers&#8217; wildest dreams, right?</p>
<p>All that given due consideration, I wanted to approach the series with an open mind, but I didn&#8217;t want to actually buy any of the books because a) this isn&#8217;t somebody I want to give money to and b) there are approximately bleventeen of the damned things and I don&#8217;t have a job. I put out a call on my social medias for donations to the cause.</p>
<p>Three weeks later, I had <em>seventeen Laurell K. Hamilton books</em>. And with various deadlines coming up? I had a week to read them in.</p>
<p>Some would have panicked. Some would have faltered. Some would have done several noisy circuits of the living room, sobbing about the hilarious injustice of life. Some would have said, &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s okay, I don&#8217;t have to read all of these, I&#8217;m not <em>that</em> much of a masochist&#8221;, picked out a selection, and called it a day.</p>
<p>I did all of these things except the last one. Here&#8217;s how I got on. The following are my initial notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Initial thoughts on LKH: The Anita Blake series is not as bad as I thought it would be for the reasons I was told I would hate it, but it is creepingly terrible in ways I didn&#8217;t really anticipate.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Day 3 of LKH immersion. Eyes gritty. Legs heavy. Some subcranial tenderness. Seem to have &#8220;What Does The Fox Say&#8221; stuck in my head.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Laurell K. Hamilton Immersion Week, Day 5. Sore throat, some muscle ache. Have been reading some of the earlier books, which are much better even if I don&#8217;t like murder mysteries that much. I&#8217;m sad that her deep love of stuffed penguins seems to be worn away by all the sexy sexy sex she starts having in a book or so&#8217;s time. What happened to Sigmund, Anita? Did Sigmund mean nothing to you? Developing protective feelings for all penguins.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>LKH Immersion Week, Day 6. I&#8230;I just don&#8217;t even know anymore, you guys. Just leave me alone. I&#8217;m going shopping for leather.</p></blockquote>
<p>By the end of the week I&#8217;d contracted a stomach virus, although the medical jury is still out on whether or not this was a symptom of my burgeoning lycanthropy. The next full moon isn&#8217;t until December 17th, so I guess we&#8217;ll find out then.</p>
<p>This is going to be a difficult bit of analysis to write, because &#8211; well, I read seventeen books, you guys. I&#8217;m having to be extremely choosy about which books I quote and why. Maybe I&#8217;ll upload a list of Supplementary Supportive Material, but, um, I wouldn&#8217;t count on it.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, dear readers, here&#8217;s the thing: <em>I didn&#8217;t hate these books the way I was expecting to</em>.</p>
<p>Look, fourteen-year-old me assumed I&#8217;d hate these books because they were a self-insert Mary-Sue-type series that ended with the main character having far too much ridiculously improbable sex and being the best at everything. Fourteen-year-old me was also scared of non-monogamy, kind of selective in her feminism and a lot more judgmental. Fourteen-year-old me would probably have written this bit of the article in a far more entertainingly vitriolic manner.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you&#8217;re stuck with twenty-three-year-old me, and twenty-three-year-old me doesn&#8217;t have a problem with any of these things on principle. Look, okay, self-insert Mary-Sues aren&#8217;t my cup of tea, and I can see why a sharp rise (hurr) in sexual content in a series which basically had no sexual content at all for the first four books might turn readers off &#8211; but those two facts don&#8217;t make either of those authorial decisions inherently wrong.</p>
<p>For all her flaws (and she has many &#8211; and I&#8217;m not just talking about the fun kind of flaws that make a character seem real, either) Anita Blake has some nice bits of refreshingly feminist outlook. One of the best story arcs in the series comes in <strong>Danse Macabre,</strong> when she has a pregnancy scare. She talks it over with all of her partners, one of them says he&#8217;ll stay at home and raise the baby so that she can keep working, and another says he&#8217;ll marry her:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Jesus, Mary and Joseph, Richard, is that all you think it takes to fix this? Marry me so the baby won&#8217;t be a bastard, and it&#8217;s all better?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see anyone else offering marriage,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s because they know I&#8217;ll say no. Every other man in my life understands that this isn&#8217;t about marriage. It&#8217;s about the fact that we may have created a little person. And we need to do whatever is best for that little person. How will marrying anyone make this work better? &#8230; What do you think having a baby will do to me, Richard? Do you think just because I have a baby I&#8217;ll become this other person? This softer, gentler person? Is that what you think?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8211; Laurell K. Hamilton, <strong>Danse Macabre</strong>, pp. 162-164</p></blockquote>
<p>Whatever else I think about Anita Blake the character, I wholeheartedly rooted for her throughout this story arc. Would it have been unrealistic for her to keep being a federal agent who has all the sex and also a baby? Sure, maybe. But this is a fantasy series and clearly delineated as such, so if that&#8217;s too much suspension of disbelief for you then <a href="http://fuckyeahscifiwomenofcolour.tumblr.com/post/37413846476/author-scott-lynch-responds-to-a-critic-of-the" target="_blank">allow me to refer you to Scott Lynch</a>.</p>
<p>Regarding the non-monogamy&#8230;well, there are not a lot of mainstream series that won&#8217;t even touch non-monogamy with a bargepole, and twenty-three-year-old me quite likes the normalisation of non-mono and monogamous relationships here. What I&#8217;m basically trying to say here is that if Laurell K. Hamilton wants to chronicle her sexy adventures as Badass The Vampire Slayer (And Harem) and people want to read it, I&#8217;m honestly okay with that. I wish she&#8217;d be more honest about what her books are (she seems to do a lot of If You Don&#8217;t Like It You&#8217;re Just Too Mainstream For My Awesomeness-ing), but &#8211; whatever. Fine.</p>
<p>However. The fact that I didn&#8217;t hate these books for the reasons I&#8217;d assumed doesn&#8217;t mean that they in no way made me want to tear my own eyes out. Unfortunately this article is skittering dangerously close to its word limit, so stand by for <strong>Part Two</strong>, in which I attempt to explain why cleanly and concisely but inevitably deteriorate into wordless, feeble sobbing.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t wait! See you then.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li><em>As a nod to Halloween, here&#8217;s our longtime friend Libby of the wonderful <a href="http://treasuryislands.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">TreasuryIslands</a> blog &#8211; check out <a href="/tag/libby/">her previous posts for us</a>. If you have a guest post a-brewing, <a href="mailto:badrepeditors@gmail.com?subject=pitch">email us on badrepeditors@gmail.com</a>.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Representations of witches and witchcraft in literature and in popular culture generally are incredibly useful to us, providing a way of critiquing the situation of women under patriarchy that is both effective and accessible.</p>
<p>Children’s literature is particularly rife with such representations. From the wicked women of Grimm and Perrault and folkloric creations like Baba Yaga and Ceridwen, through C.S. Lewis’ Jadis and the maleficent creations of Mary de Morgan to 20th century inventions like TH White’s Madam Mim and the female students of Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry, lady sorcerers &#8211; both good and evil &#8211; have never been far from the pages of the books we have used to educate and entertain our children.</p>
<p>The witches of the classic fairytales and of the stories of the Victorian era are usually monstrous and spiteful, using their magic in service of the Devil &#8211; or worse, their own self-interest. They taunt because they can and have few, if any, redeeming characteristics.</p>
<p>In recent decades the image of the image of the witch in popular culture has undergone a transformation, in no small part due to the witches that have appeared in juvenile literature. Since the 1970s, the stories our children have read have overwhelmingly featured good witches (though the frequency with which they are presented as inept deserves some attention). These are my favourites of the modern circle.</p>
<h2>Mildred Hubble</h2>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/mildredhubble.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="14164" data-permalink="/2013/10/30/guest-post-five-witches-from-childrens-literature/mildredhubble/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/mildredhubble.jpg?fit=297%2C285&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="297,285" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="mildredhubble" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/mildredhubble.jpg?fit=297%2C285&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/mildredhubble.jpg?fit=297%2C285&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/mildredhubble.jpg?resize=297%2C285" alt="mildredhubble" width="297" height="285" class="alignright size-full wp-image-14164" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Created when Jill Murphy was a teenager, <a href="http://www.puffin.co.uk/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780141314501,00.html" target="_blank"><strong>The Worst Witch</strong></a> series follows the adventures of Mildred Hubble as she navigates the social and academic challenges of Miss Cackle’s Academy, a draughty old castle that perches atop a thickly forested mountain and ‘looks more like a prison than a school’.</p>
<p>It’s an uncomfortable enough environment for a youngster to be in, but Mildred has an added disadvantage, being marked as an outsider by her unkempt appearance and her tabby cat (given to her when the rest of the girls receive sleek black kitties).</p>
<blockquote><p>She was one of those people who always seem to be in trouble. She didn’t exactly mean to break rules and annoy the teachers, but things just seemed to happen when Mildred was around.</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>The Worst Witch</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The young witch is thoroughly well-meaning and a little too clever for her own good, but she’s also bumbling and frequently wrangling with authority figures. Despite her perceived inadequacies, there’s an air of serendipity that follows her around; her failures and misdeeds inevitably lead to a positive outcome of much greater consequence than the proceeding mishap.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is why she is so well-loved by young readers and so fondly remembered by adults. Often we can see a little of ourselves in Mildred &#8211; from her practical incompetence to her trailing shoe laces, she’s a reminder that you don’t have to be perfect to be wonderful.</p>
<h2>Mary Newbury</h2>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/witchchild.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="14152" data-permalink="/2013/10/30/guest-post-five-witches-from-childrens-literature/witchchild/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/witchchild.jpg?fit=182%2C265&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="182,265" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="witchchild" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/witchchild.jpg?fit=182%2C265&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/witchchild.jpg?fit=182%2C265&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-14152" alt="witchchild" src="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/witchchild.jpg?resize=182%2C265" width="182" height="265" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>The only work of historical fiction on my list, Celia Rees’ <a href="http://www.witchchild.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Witch Child</strong></a> is an overtly feminist text. The protagonist of the book (and its sequel, <a href="http://www.celiarees.com/books/sorceress.html" target="_blank"><strong>Sorceress</strong></a>) is Mary Newbury, an adolescent witch forced to flee to the New World following the violent death of her grandmother at the hands of<br />
witch-hunters.</p>
<p>Caught between a desire to be true to herself and the hypocrisy of Puritanism, Mary is headstrong, smart, empathetic and brave. She exhibits a tolerance that is unusual for her era and generally makes herself an excellent role model for young readers.</p>
<p>For Mary, independence poses a threat &#8211; she lives in a time that fears capable women, and her agency and determination could lead her to the same fate as her grandmother. But still she forges onwards, using her wit and her alacrity to light the way and finding friendship and love among another marginalised group.</p>
<blockquote><p>I should flee, get away. They will turn on me next unless I go. But where to? What am I to do? Lose myself. Die in the forest. I look around. Eyes, hard with hatred, slide from mine. Mouths twitch between leering and sneering. I will not run away into the forest, because that is what they want me to do.</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>Witch Child</strong></p></blockquote>
<h2>Tiffany Aching</h2>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/tiffanyachinggrannyweatherwax.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="14153" data-permalink="/2013/10/30/guest-post-five-witches-from-childrens-literature/tiffanyachinggrannyweatherwax/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/tiffanyachinggrannyweatherwax.jpg?fit=318%2C235&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="318,235" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="tiffanyachinggrannyweatherwax" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/tiffanyachinggrannyweatherwax.jpg?fit=300%2C221&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/tiffanyachinggrannyweatherwax.jpg?fit=318%2C235&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-14153" alt="tiffanyachinggrannyweatherwax" src="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/tiffanyachinggrannyweatherwax-300x221.jpg?resize=300%2C221" width="300" height="221" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/tiffanyachinggrannyweatherwax.jpg?resize=300%2C221&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/tiffanyachinggrannyweatherwax.jpg?w=318&amp;ssl=1 318w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> Terry Pratchett’s <a href="http://www.terrypratchettbooks.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Discworld</strong></a> series is often lauded as feminist; he ridicules misogyny and satirises stereotypes, he writes Strong Female Characters. But there is an incongruency to Pratchett’s feminism which undermines his intended message and ultimately, <strong>Discworld</strong> is, whisper it, <em>not that feminist</em>.</p>
<p>Tiffany Aching is, to paraphrase her creator, the most feminist of the feminists that he does not have. A child savant, she begins her witching career at nine years old when she embarks upon a quest to save her brother from a sinister fairyland <em>a la</em> <strong>Labyrinth</strong>. She’s got common sense and amazing chutzpah. While remaining a completely believable pre-teen, she’s shrewd, smart and she will not be condescended to.</p>
<blockquote><p>‘Zoology, eh? That’s a big word, isn’t it?’<br />
‘No, actually it isn’t,’ said Tiffany. ‘Patronising is a big word. Zoology is quite short.’</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>The Wee Free Men</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>As Tiffany grows up (she is approaching 16 at the time of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Shall-Wear-Midnight-Discworld-Novels/dp/0552166057" target="_blank"><strong>I Shall Wear Midnight</strong></a>) It becomes clear that she is the natural successor to Granny Weatherwax, the number one witch of the <strong>Discworld</strong> series, as she begins to display magical abilities rare in people of her age as well as exhibiting characteristics she shares with her mentor &#8211; gravitas, knowledge, a tendency towards literalism and the belief that a witch should remain single. Tiffany will ultimately become a better witch than Granny, and it is a pleasure to watch her get there.</p>
<h2>Minerva McGonagall</h2>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/SmithMcGonagallHP71.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="14155" data-permalink="/2013/10/30/guest-post-five-witches-from-childrens-literature/smithmcgonagallhp7-2/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/SmithMcGonagallHP71.jpg?fit=284%2C177&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="284,177" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="SmithMcGonagallHP7" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/SmithMcGonagallHP71.jpg?fit=284%2C177&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/SmithMcGonagallHP71.jpg?fit=284%2C177&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-14155" alt="SmithMcGonagallHP7" src="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/SmithMcGonagallHP71.jpg?resize=284%2C177" width="284" height="177" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Transfiguration Mistress &#8211; and latterly Deputy Headmistress &#8211; at Hogwarts, Minerva McGonagall is both wise and motherly, embodying a binary that women are frequently told they cannot.</p>
<p>McGonagall cares for her charges deeply, but not blindly. She is fair and ethical and has gained great respect within the Hogwarts hierarchy. She’s often sharp with students and teachers alike, she’s a keen believer in rules &#8211; without being mindlessly bound to them &#8211; and she’s a fan of order in her classroom.</p>
<p>With a witty remark or condescending quip never far from her thin lips, Minerva McGonagall is a force to be reckoned with.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8216;Oh, I can&#8217;t wait to see McGonagall inspected,&#8217; said Ron happily. &#8216;Umbridge won&#8217;t know what&#8217;s hit her.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Though she is a slight woman in her seventies, McGonagall is a fearless combatant in the battle that rages at the close of the series, directing the action and engaging directly with Voldemort in defence of the institution and the people that she loves.</p>
<p>There are many women in JK Rowling&#8217;s <strong>Harry Potter</strong> series that display fine qualities &#8211; caring and protective Mrs Weasley; book-smart Hermione; fearless Tonks; even Delores Umbridge can be admired for her sheer bloodymindedness and determination. But McGonagall seems to embody all these qualities and then some.</p>
<h2>Winnie the Witch</h2>
<blockquote><p>Winnie the Witch lived in a black house in the forest. The house was black on the outside and black on the inside. The carpets were black. The chairs were black. The bed was black and it had black sheets and black blankets. Even the bath was black.</p>
<p>Winnie lived in her black house with her cat, Wilbur. He was black too. And that is how the trouble began.</p>
<p>&#8211; <em>Winnie the Witch</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Created by Valerie Thomas and illustrated by Korky Paul, she’s a comical character by design, gangly and tall with an unruly mane of black hair and a reddened nose that I like to imagine comes from a fondness for gin. When we first meet her, she is the only colourful thing in a very dark world. A series of books for middle grade readers featuring Winnie is <a href="http://www.winnie-the-witch.com/the-authors.php" target="_blank">also available</a>, written by Laura Owen.</p>
<p>But Winnie has no qualms over using her magic to amend the world around her to suit her own purposes without considering the consequences. Winnie is heedless and impulsive, with a catch-all cry of &#8216;ABRACADABRA&#8217; that, predictably, gets her into scrapes.</p>
<p>She learns from her blunders, though, and she puts things right with grace and unerrring joy. Winnie the Witch lives a hedonistic life and she makes mistakes, but she’s always got a genuine smile on her face and that’s what makes her so refreshing.</p>

<ul>
<li><em><a href="/tag/libby/"><strong>Libby</strong></a> earned her feminist stripes interning for the <a href="http://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/" target="_blank">Fawcett Society</a> where she was horrified by most of the stories she heard. An accidental activist, she is a regular contributor to <a href="http://bicommunitynews.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>BCN</strong></a>. Her blog, <a href="http://treasuryislands.wordpress.com/" target="_blank"><strong>TreasuryIslands</strong></a>, is the home of her other passion &#8211; children’s literature. Libby is very proud of her bad reputation.</em></li>

<h2>Widow imagery on &#8216;The Gilmore Girls&#8217;</h2>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Paris-.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="14113" data-permalink="/2013/10/22/veiled-threats-widows-and-pseudowidows-12/paris/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Paris-.jpg?fit=240%2C320&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="240,320" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Paris" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Paris-.jpg?fit=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Paris-.jpg?fit=240%2C320&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-14113" alt="Paris" src="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Paris-.jpg?resize=240%2C320" width="240" height="320" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Paris-.jpg?w=240&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Paris-.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>The Gilmore girls (of TV&#8217;s <strong>The Gilmore Girls</strong>) don’t have an awful lot in common with the thirteenth century Beguines. Paris Geller, on the other hand – Rory Gilmore’s nemesis, love rival, roommate, co-plotter and sometime editor – also attracts ridicule as a young woman who presumes on the privileges of widowhood.</p>
<p>Her affair with her professor, the novelist Asher Fleming, is treated by most people as a slightly tacky fling between a vain older man and a naive young student. Whilst Paris drops broad hints to Rory about her grand passion (“Mmm, I smell of pipe smoke&#8230;”) it is made pretty clear to the audience that Fleming regularly has casual affairs with young women who take his course.</p>
<p>When he dies suddenly (&#8220;When he&#8230;were you&#8230;?&#8221; &#8220;No, Rory. This great man was not laid low by my vagina.&#8221;) Paris goes into mourning, and is appalled that not enough notice is being taken on campus. She takes it upon herself to hold a wake for Fleming, complete with a stack of his last book and herself in dignified black, holding court on the sofa.</p>
<p>Though Paris is not treated as cruelly as Miss Havisham, her party is marked out as the culmination of her grandiose ideas about her relationship. Behaving as Asher’s widow is another one of Paris’ obsessive eccentricities, and the scene is undercut by the appearance of a beer keg in the background by two frat boys whom Rory hurriedly shoos away.</p>
<p>Paris may believe she is enabling the community to pay their proper respects to a great man of letters, whose loss she inevitably feels most keenly, but most of the people at the party think it’s a kegger thrown by some girl they’ve never heard of.</p>
<p>It’s a funny sequence, and Paris is given an unexpected emotional weight by Liza Weil, but the narrative makes it clear she is not entitled to widowhood, and no-one grants it to her. Apart from Emily Gilmore, admittedly, which does nothing to bolster Paris’ cause.</p>
<h2>Funeral Blues</h2>
<p>This tension between people who feel like widows, and the society which refuses to legitimise their view of themselves, is given another twist in the final example I’d like to discuss: the speaker in W.H. Auden’s poem <strong>Funeral Blues</strong>.</p>
<p>Performed so memorably by John Hannah in <strong>Four Weddings and A Funeral</strong>, the poem has become one of the most famous and popular elegies in English. In its best known version, the poem runs thus:</p>
<p><em>Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone,<br />
Prevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone,<br />
Silence the pianos and with muffled drum<br />
Bring out the coffin, let the mourners come.</em></p>
<p><em>Let aeroplanes circle moaning overhead</em><br />
<em> Scribbling on the sky the message He Is Dead,</em><br />
<em> Put crepe bows round the white necks of the public doves,</em><br />
<em> Let the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves.</em></p>
<p><em>He was my North, my South, my East and West,</em><br />
<em> My working week and my Sunday rest,</em><br />
<em> My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song;</em><br />
<em> I thought that love would last for ever: I was wrong.</em></p>
<p><em>The stars are not wanted now: put out every one;</em><br />
<em> Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun;</em><br />
<em> Pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood.</em><br />
<em> For nothing now can ever come to any good.</em></p>
<p>There’s a noticeable shift between the second and third verses in the treatment of the death and its consequences. From demanding exaggerated outward ceremonies to mark the beloved’s death, the poem starts to imagine in both more personal and more cosmological terms.</p>
<p>If the first two verses concentrate on the public and social sphere (the area in which widowhood is bestowed and validated, as we have seen), the latter two are concerned with the relationship of one individual to the whole universe, and how that has been dislocated by another person’s death.</p>
<p>In both there is an anguished hyperbole, an awareness of the discrepancy between the speaker’s own feelings and the way the rest of the world sees the matter. The irony of the lines about the pigeons and the sun are directed inwards, sketching the speaker’s recognition of their lack of proportion alongside a refusal to countenance the idea that proportion is possible any more.</p>
<p>In some ways, it captures Olivia and Paris’ situation from both their own perspective and that of the audience watching them.</p>
<p>That pivot didn’t always shift the poem in this direction, however. The verses were originally composed for a play called <strong>The Ascent of F2</strong>, about a climber who dies whilst attempting a famously dangerous mountain, having been persuaded by the prospect of public glory and national pride. His lover speaks the lines, which share the first two verses with the later version, but then veer off like this:</p>
<p><em>Hold up your umbrellas to keep off the rain<br />
From Doctor Williams while he opens a vein;<br />
Life, he pronounces, it is finally extinct.<br />
Sergeant, arrest that man who said he winked!</em></p>
<p><em>Shawcross will say a few words sad and kind</em><br />
<em> To the weeping crowds about the Master-mind,</em><br />
<em> While Lamp with a powerful microscope</em><br />
<em> Searches their faces for a sign of hope.</em></p>
<p><em>And Gunn, of course, will drive a motor-hearse:</em><br />
<em> None could drive it better, most would drive it worse.</em><br />
<em> He’ll open up the throttle to its fullest power</em><br />
<em> And drive him to the grave at ninety miles an hour.</em></p>
<p>The satire here is more obvious, and directly develops the first two verses’ slanted glance at the public commemoration of a death. They’re more clearly about the uselessness of marking someone’s funeral with great pomp, without being so specific about the internal emotional world which is being contrasted with those rituals.</p>
<p>Auden reworked the poem as part of a collection of cabaret songs for the singer Heidli Anderson. I find it difficult to read <strong>Funeral Blues</strong>, in the light of its earlier appearance (and alongside the other songs), without finding an implication that the singer is mourning a dead politician she had an affair with.</p>
<p>The pivot in the middle, from this angle, marks the shift between her satirical comments on the grandiose ceremonies accorded him, and her insistence that the person he really mattered to won’t be recognised during them.</p>
<h2>The politics of widowhood</h2>
<p>John Hannah’s performance of the poem during the funeral scene of Richard Curtis’ movie brings out this reading strongly. Putting <strong>Funeral Blues</strong> in the mouth of a gay man mourning his partner shows up the political dimension of the issue of who is regarded as someone’s &#8220;widow&#8221;.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/b_a-eXIoyYA" height="315" width="420" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>The lines’ scorn for the rituals and regulations of public grief map provocatively across the character’s situation, legally barred from being recognised as the surviving spouse.</p>
<p>Anxieties around widowhood – and non-widowhood – are a recurring feature of literary history, taking various forms but often expressing the fears of a dominant group that they are losing the ability to define and control other people’s identities.</p>
<p>We might be tempted to mock the anxiety of medieval, early modern and Victorian societies who were so anxious to police the status of widowhood, and so strenuously exerted cultural authority stop people whom they imagined wanted to “play” at being widows. But there are articles and speeches being written right now in response to the prospect of equal marriage, which engage repugnantly in the same task.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I once spent three years researching a particular widow, on and off.</p>
<p>The Duchess at the centre of John Webster&#8217;s play <strong>The Duchess of Malfi</strong> (1612-13) acquires a lot of her edginess in the original play from the fact that her husband has died before the action begins. She is a young – and according to her brother Ferdinand, &#8220;lusty&#8221; – widow, whose combination of financial independence and sexual experience makes many in her vicinity nervous.</p>
<p>The equivalent man would be called &#8220;eligible&#8221;, and receive a lot of invitations from women with marriageable daughters. But a woman in the same situation becomes the subject of a campaign of surveillance and torture which ends in her death.</p>

She’s an extreme case, admittedly: few other fictional widows end up eating apricots grown in horse dung, kissing the severed hand of their husband or being strangled on the orders of their lycanthropic and potentially incestuous twin brother.</p>
<p>But a continual low charge hums around widows, from the comic grotesque of Widow Twankey to the alluringly threatening Black Widows of gangster novels. Via the Wife of Bath, the Dowager Duchess of Grantham and Aouda from <strong>Eighty Days Around The World</strong>, to take a handful nearly at random.</p>
<p>Of course it alters across the eras, but time and time again, the figure of the widow acts as a focus for drama.</p>
<p>Sometimes the charge seems to derive from the fact that she is no longer dependent upon any man, or socially &#8220;explained&#8221; via her relationship to a father or husband. Sometimes it comes instead from the way a widow is seen as <em>over</em>-defining herself in relation to a man no longer present.</p>
<p>Either way, widows in literature often hold the potential to disrupt social order in a variety of ways.</p>
<h2>Widows and Pseudowidows</h2>
<p>This article, however, is not about widows. It is about women who are <em>not</em> widows. Or rather, women who aren’t widows whilst still looking, sounding, or acting like them.</p>
<p>When considering famous widows in literature, it struck me that two of the names that sprang to mind – Miss Havisham in Dickens&#8217;s <strong>Great Expectations</strong> and Olivia in Shakespeare&#8217;s <strong>Twelfth Night</strong> – don’t technically fit the criteria.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/missh.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="13848" data-permalink="/2013/10/22/veiled-threats-widows-and-pseudowidows-12/missh/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/missh.jpg?fit=620%2C413&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="620,413" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="missh" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/missh.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/missh.jpg?fit=620%2C413&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright  wp-image-13848" alt="missh" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/missh.jpg?resize=372%2C248" width="372" height="248" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Miss Havisham’s veil is worn to mourn the marriage that never happened, whilst Olivia’s is to remind her of her dead brother, whose memory stops her from wanting to receive suitors. Nonetheless, they both look to me as if they’re trying to take on the role, adopting some of the characteristics associated with grieving spouses.</p>
<p>They wear specific clothes to mark their separation from other people (and from their previous selves), withdraw from normal social life, and refuse to put themselves under the jurisdiction of men. Neither are exactly successful in their attempt to construct themselves positively within the role of a widow.</p>
<p>Miss Havisham has become an icon of &#8220;frustrated&#8221; and &#8220;twisted&#8221; womanhood, unsuccessful within the novel’s plot and the butt of jokes in subsequent culture. She becomes a “tragic” figure in both the classical and slang senses of the word: an image of wronged heroism in her own mind, and a sad bitter spinster to the world outside.</p>
<p>Her veil, usually a temporary garment to mark her passing between two states, becomes a fixture, blending with the cobwebs which now cover her wedding cake. In Miss Havisham, Dickens created a figure who memorably combines the revulsion and anxiety felt by Victorian (and later) society towards women who refuse to play out the social roles ascribed to them.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Charles_Robert_Leslie_Olivia.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="13846" data-permalink="/2013/10/22/veiled-threats-widows-and-pseudowidows-12/charles_robert_leslie_olivia/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Charles_Robert_Leslie_Olivia.jpg?fit=474%2C599&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="474,599" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Charles_Robert_Leslie,_Olivia" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Charles_Robert_Leslie_Olivia.jpg?fit=237%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Charles_Robert_Leslie_Olivia.jpg?fit=474%2C599&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright  wp-image-13846" alt="Charles_Robert_Leslie,_Olivia" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Charles_Robert_Leslie_Olivia.jpg?resize=284%2C359" width="284" height="359" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Olivia from <strong>Twelfth Night</strong> is similarly associated with a veil, at least at the beginning of the play. The first thing we hear about her is that for seven years the world “Shall not behold her face at ample view/ But, like a cloistress, she will veiled walk&#8230;all this to season/ A brother’s dead love, which she would keep fresh/ And lasting in her memory”.</p>
<p>When Viola (dressed as the male Cesario) manages to speak to her, Olivia prepares by putting her veil back on, setting up the comedy by-play in which Viola claims not to know who the lady of the house is, and the moment when Olivia pulls it back and demands “Look you, sir, such a one I was this present. Is’t not well done?”</p>
<p>Within the first act the grieving Olivia’s attempt to seclude herself is defeated by a combination of plot and Viola’s rhetorical skills. The play treats her mourning as one of the restrictive, self-imposed roles which so many of the characters are trapped in as the action begins. Orsino is locked into his schtick as self-obsessed Petrarchan lover, Sir Toby as the party knight who slinks home in the early hours of every morning, Malvolio as the image of Puritan rectitude and Olivia as the grieving veiled figure wandering inconsolably around her rooms as if her husband had just died.</p>
<p>These roles are all disrupted for the audience’s amusement and the characters’ correction during the ensuing scenes, with the play particularly conspiring to trick Olivia out of her image of herself as a grand widow. There’s an echo here of Miss Havisham, though in a very different key: women are not permitted to adopt the role of widow simply because they want to.</p>
<p>Both characters are diverted away from a successful performance as “pseudowidows” by the narratives in which they appear: Olivia to happy marriage and Miss Havisham to pathological bitterness and mockery.</p>
<h2>&#8216;A veil of wickedness&#8217;</h2>
<p>In fact we don’t have to rely on my close-reading of these fictional texts to find anxiety around women “playing” at being widows. That harping on Olivia wearing a veil and walking secluded from men “like a cloistress” brings another group of women into play, whose apparent freedom from male jurisdiction has produced anger and revulsion in various eras.</p>
<p>I don’t have space to examine the way in which nuns in the Middle Ages navigated the rhetoric of “brides of Christ” alongside the reality that many entered the community after the death of a husband, or their social position. But one particular case stands out amongst the criticism of female religious orders: the bishop of Olmüt’s attack on the Beguines.</p>
<p>These women, who lived together in small self-governing groups, taking few vows and following the Rule of no specific order, were the subject of a lot of criticism in the later thirteenth century. Bruno, the bishop in question, wrote to the pope in 1273 to demand they be suppressed.</p>
<p>In R.W. Southern’s words:</p>
<blockquote><p>he complained that&#8230;the women used their liberty as a veil of wickedness in order to escape the yoke of obedience to their priests and ‘the coercion of marital bonds’. Above all, he was indignant that young women should assume the status of widowhood against the authority of the Apostle who approved no widows under the age of sixty.</p></blockquote>
<p>The bishop was referring to verses in the New Testament book of 1 Timothy, in which instructions are given for the way the “order of widows” should be run and who should be admitted. These women, who worked for the church and were provided with support, should all be over the age of sixty, have a good reputation and previously carried out pious works.</p>
<p>Obviously “widow” has a technical significance in this Biblical passage, but I was fascinated by Bruno’s line of attack: that the young women of the Beguines were setting themselves up <em>as if</em> they were widows, and thus escaping male authority.</p>
<p>His metaphor of a &#8220;veil of wickedness&#8221; once again acts as a focus for male anxiety over women who won’t accept their assigned role.</p>
<p>In part two of this post, I&#8217;ll delve into widow imagery in modern TV and film, including <strong>The Gilmore Girls</strong> and <strong>Four Weddings and a Funeral</strong>.</p>

<p>It was at once a brilliant and thoroughly embarrassing afternoon.</p>
<p>I came home exhausted and tearful, clutching a new book and my partner&#8217;s sleeve.  &#8220;But I can&#8217;t write about that!&#8221; I protested.  &#8220;What would I draw for it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hello, BadRep readers.  I&#8217;m here to tell you about the time I embarrassed myself in a museum.</p>

<p>I live in Cambridge, which is a nice place, and contains the Fitzwilliam Museum, which is also nice.  Startlingly nice, in fact.  Long warrens of gold-framed paintings, glass cabinets full of glittering treasures, and ancient wooden tables polished to a mirror sheen with little toblerone notices on them telling you to keep your paws off, thank you.</ul>
<p>There&#8217;s marble busts that I could look at for years and never get old, myriad hoards of coins, terrible thorny ranks of daggers and swords, medieval Christian bling and a glorious rotating selection of temporary exhibitions.</p>
<p>Their temporary exhibitions are spectacular.  They recently had one on Chinese tomb treasures that I saw posters for when I was visiting London.  &#8220;I&#8217;ve been to that!&#8221; I exclaimed, pointing at a poster on the Tube.  But no-one was impressed, for they were cultured London types with the British Museum on their doorstep, and I am a scruffy Cambridge yokel with orange hair and visible underpants.</p>
<p>The most recent standout exhibit &#8211; which was so busy they had to implement a timed ticket system &#8211; was the <a href="http://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/whatson/exhibitions/article.html?3680" target="_blank"><strong>Quentin Blake: Drawn By Hand</strong></a> exhibition.</p>
<p>You all know who <strong>Quentin Blake</strong> is, of course.  He illustrated all of <strong>Roald Dahl&#8217;s</strong> books for children and many other things besides.  I wasn&#8217;t very familiar with his &#8220;many other things besides&#8221;, though, and that was what this exhibit showed me.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t know, for example, that he has done public paintings for hospitals.  There were many of his maternity-unit paintings, all involving cheerful mothers having fun in a variety of scenes (some are <a href="http://quentinblake.com/gallery/hospitals/item/344-2011sallesdebain1-100x100cm" target="_blank">underwater for a water-birthing unit</a>) and all very sweet and soothing to look at.</p>
<p>And there was this one that made me lose my shit comprehensively.</p>
<p>I was already on delicate emotional footing because I have a lot of feelings about Quentin Blake, and then I came across this painting he&#8217;d done for the Vincent Square eating disorder treatment unit in London.</p>
<p>The painting, titled <strong>Ordinary Life No. 8</strong>, is of <a href="http://quentinblake.com/gallery/hospitals/item/334-2010edu8" target="_blank">a young woman in her hospital room in a gown</a>, feeding birds on her windowsill through the open sash window.  She looks happy, and all the birds are eating seeds.</p>
<p>This just in: I have just started crying writing that paragraph.</p>
<p>I am at work.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s in her room, where she has to stay until she&#8217;s better, but the birds can go where they please; she is happy to feed the birds, and the birds are happy to be fed.  Oh my god, there are so many things in that piece that kind of punched me in the heart until I burst into a fire hydrant of noisy tears in the middle of the reflective silence of the exhibit.</p>
<p>Some very well-behaved children turned around and scowled at me.  My partner ushered me on.  The next piece was <a href="http://standpointmag.co.uk/files/blake3.jpg" target="_blank">from the lithograph series <strong>Girls and Dogs</strong></a>, of a young girl in a red dress, happily showing a gigantic pitch-black terrifying-looking wolf monster a painting she&#8217;d done.  The tears came again, only worse.</p>
<p>And then, at the end, there was an illustration for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boy_in_the_Dress" target="_blank"><strong>The Boy In The Dress</strong></a> (a children&#8217;s novel by <strong>David Walliams</strong>, of all people) and it was all too much and I had to leave.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mummy,&#8221; said a small child with crisp, angelic gold ringlets bearing aloft a blue ribbon, &#8220;That man is crying&#8221;.</p>
<p>Blake&#8217;s paintings, with their characteristic loose, expressive style &#8211; fluid washes of watercolour and ink contained by haphazard spidery cages of scratchy black ink somehow conspiring to be more life-accurate than anything photorealism could ever offer &#8211; capture and reflect simple happiness and freedom.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to use words like &#8220;innocence&#8221;, because I don&#8217;t like its implications of fetishising a lack of knowledge.  Blake&#8217;s paintings are very canny; their veneer of simplicity disguising a great depth of self-awareness and knowledge of the subject.</p>
<p>The young girl showing the big wolf her painting isn&#8217;t afraid of the big wolf.  The big wolf likes her painting, and looms in front of her with giant, masonry-nail fangs bared in an appreciative grin.  She has nothing to fear from her playmate, however, because she is brave and has made friends with something that others would find terrifying and avoid.</p>
<p>The young woman in her hospital room is finding joy in feeding the birds.  The birds don&#8217;t know why she&#8217;s in hospital, or of her own difficulties with food; they just like seeds and she&#8217;s put some out for them.</p>
<p>I bought a copy of <strong>The Boy In The Dress</strong> on the way home.  An entire exhibition of mostly women, magic and birds and I end up with a book about a boy who likes to wear dresses.  That&#8217;s top marketing, that.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll let you know how it is.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Like most of the Disney Renaissance heroines, hers is the story of a successful transition from the rule of the father to the rule of the husband. But how did we get to something so squeaky-clean? ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li><em><strong>Ed&#8217;s Note:</strong> This post is partly in honour of <a href="http://poemsunderwater.wordpress.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Poems Underwater</strong></a>, a new project on the symbolism of the mermaid our Hodge is involved with, which you are hereby urged to check out (and perhaps <a href="http://poemsunderwater.wordpress.com/contribute/" target="_blank">contribute</a> to, as it has a zine and everything!).</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Released in 1989, Disney’s <strong>The Little Mermaid</strong> heralded the start of the ‘Disney Renaissance’ – a period of critical and commercial success that followed a rocky patch where the studio’s prime focus had been on Disneyland attractions rather than feature films.</p>
<p>It was soundtracked by <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/beauty-and-the-plague" target="_blank">Broadway golden boy Howard Ashman</a>, who changed the planned English butler crab into a Jamaican crustacean named Sebastian, and reworked the film’s structure to more closely align with that of a Broadway musical. He also decided to base Ursula the Sea Witch on drag artist and disco star <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_(performer)" target="_blank">Divine</a> (who died whilst the film was still in production).</p>
<p>Ashman died of AIDS two years later, in March 1991, but his musical influence, first on <b>Mermaid</b>, and subsequently on <strong>Beauty and the Beast</strong> and <strong>Aladdin</strong>, was a major factor in the regeneration of the studio in the early nineties. <strong>Mermaid</strong> won Oscar gongs for Best Song and Best Score, the first Oscar nod for Disney since the Seventies.</p>
<h2>Mermaids of the Eighties</h2>

<p>The Disney studio had been considering Hans Christian Andersen’s <b>The Little Mermaid </b>for adaptation as early as the <strong>Snow White</strong> years, but it was not until the late Eighties that the time finally seemed right. Even then, there was concern it might too closely duplicate <b>Splash</b>, which Disney had produced in 1984.</p>
<p><strong>Splash</strong> itself had been rushed through production because there were rumours of another mermaid film in the pipeline elsewhere – a Warren Beatty vehicle that eventually fell through. Why exactly mermaids were suddenly in the ascendant during this particular period of the late twentieth century is open to speculation; at any rate, the nudity and adult content in <strong>Splash</strong> led directly to the creation of Touchstone Pictures, Disney’s ‘older audiences’ label. Mermaids (particularly Darryl Hannah&#8217;s mermaid) were too sexual for the family studio in 1984.</p>
<p>Ironically, of course, <em>mermaid</em> &#8211; “maiden of the sea” – suggests that these aquatic women are rather more virginal than ‘Touchstone Pictures’ thought. Traditional (cisnormative) misogynistic popular wisdom holds women in general to be ‘leaky vessels’, because of the amount of ‘moisture’ they produce, but though mermaids live in the water, they have no apparent human genitalia, making them, by contrast, vessels that are rather neatly sealed.</p>
<p>In this, they link with the Virgin Mary, who appears in Catholic symbolism as a ‘fountain forever sealed’ in the middle of an enclosed garden, representing the Immaculate Conception. Mary’s homonymic (and virginal) association with mermaids, and the link between the sea (<em>mer</em>) and the mother (<em>mere</em>) introduces an additional layer to this.</p>
<p>Alongside this, there is also a parallel virgin/whore tradition of the mermaid as prostitute and even embodied vagina (since, famously, vaginas are often described as smelling like fish).</p>

<p>This opposing strand presumably comes from sailors’ fear of the Siren-figure and the unknowns out in the sea, but it’s also connected with a different type of mermaid altogether – the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/patia/2610080360/" target="_blank">melusine</a>. A double-tailed half-woman, half-fish, her intrinsic, though hidden, fishiness only emerges when she takes a bath. Even then, the double tail leaves her human genitalia open to the world in what <a href="http://www.endicott-studio.com/jMA03Summer/theMermaid.html">some have claimed</a> is an appropriation of older symbols of female fertility, such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheela_na_gig">Sheela na gig</a> or even the goddess Venus (an alternative ‘mother’ connection).</p>
<p>Incidentally the melusine, not the mermaid, is the figure in the (now closely cropped) logo for Starbucks coffee, the first branch of which opened &#8211; logo blazing proud, bare-breasted and double-tailed &#8211; in 1971, a decade before <strong>Splash</strong> went into production.</p>
<p>The coffee-shop melusine was maintained in her full glory until 1987 (although she was &#8216;sealed&#8217; at the point where the tails meet, <a href="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3129/2610080360_b4d8ba0e2d.jpg" target="_blank">as her original had not been</a>); the first of several censoring crops came into effect around the time Disney bosses turned their attention to Andersen.</p>
<p>For a modern contrast to the &#8216;sealed off&#8217; melusine, have a look at one of the <a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/lynxmermaid3.jpg" target="_blank">mermaids commissioned by men&#8217;s deodorant brand Lynx for an early Noughties advertising campaign</a>, whose posterior is beginning to resurface through her scales, soft porn-like.</p>
<h2>Planning The Little Mermaid</h2>
<p>Hans Christian Andersen’s original <strong>Little Mermaid</strong> tale was serviceable, but – much like Starbucks’ logo – it had to be sanitised before Disney could take it to a Disney audience. Tellingly, the changes proposed during this period of pre-production were substantially same as the ones suggested during the preliminary work in the Thirties.</p>
<div id="attachment_13481" style="width: 258px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hans-anderson.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13481" data-attachment-id="13481" data-permalink="/2013/04/29/undressing-the-little-mermaid-disney-adapts-andersen/hans-anderson/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hans-anderson.jpg?fit=393%2C599&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="393,599" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Hans Christian Anderson" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hans-anderson.jpg?fit=197%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hans-anderson.jpg?fit=393%2C599&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-13481  " alt="Hans Christian Anderson, photographed by Thora Hallager" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hans-anderson.jpg?resize=248%2C377" width="248" height="377" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-13481" class="wp-caption-text">Hans Christian Andersen, photographed by Thora Hallager</p></div>
<p>The first thing to do was give it a happy ending, since in Andersen’s version the Prince’s indifference to the mermaid <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/05/09/fairy-tale-fest-the-best-adaptation-of-the-little-mermaid-ive-ever-seen/" target="_blank">results in her annihilation</a> and transformation to ‘a daughter of the air’.</p>
<p>This was typical Andersen: he wrote that ‘most of what I have written is a reflection of myself’, and he was not a terribly happy man. Unreciprocated love was an ongoing feature of his life, and throughout it he nursed passions for various inappropriate people.</p>
<p>These included celebrity soprano Jenny Lind (who is said to have inspired his story <strong>The Nightingale</strong> after she put him firmly in the friendzone in 1844) and various straight men, but he also wrote of avoiding actual sexual encounters – his diary records him visiting prostitutes, talking to them, and then returning home to masturbate alone.</p>
<p>Many of his ‘fairy tales’ are characterised by violence, speechlessness and unreciprocated love, often across two different ‘species’, as with the tin soldier’s love for a paper ballerina in <strong>The Steadfast Tin Soldier</strong>, or indeed the Little Mermaid’s love for the human Prince – a feature that tends to make them, like their author, rather sexless in approach.</p>
<p>Although the sad stuff was scrapped, the symbolically significant speechlessness of the Mermaid was maintained in the Disney screenplay. A mermaid’s voice is her primary power, since her singing can lure sailors to their deaths, so its loss is a significant one – aphonia in a milder form had also been a feature of <strong>Splash</strong>, where Darryl Hannah’s character cannot initially speak English.</p>
<p>Disney’s Ariel was voiced by Broadway star (and Ashman associate) Jodi Benson, and her voice remains her defining beauty in the film. But the manner of its loss changes: while both Little Mermaids give their voices up to the Sea Witch, in Andersen&#8217;s story the unnamed mermaid has her tongue cut out to bring this about. Disney cleaned this up, and, in the process, rendered it reversible: Ariel’s voice is depicted as a glowing, ghostly ball that can pass through bodily barriers without drawing blood – as in traditional artistic representations of the soul.</p>
<p>Ironically, this is exactly what Andersen’s mermaid is seeking: her love for the prince is the means through which she hopes to win ‘immortality’ and the chance to share in the joys of paradise. (This rather Romantic notion, albeit gender-inverted, links Andersen’s tale thematically with Friedrich de la Motte’s mermaid <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undine_(novella)" target="_blank"><strong>Undine</strong></a> &#8211; and also Tchaikovsky’s watery <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swan_Lake" target="_blank"><strong>Swan Lake</strong></a>, composed in 1875, the year Andersen died). Disney refocused the mermaid&#8217;s longing for a soul to a more secular – and sexualised – teenage quest for the love of a handsome prince.</p>
<h2>She sells sea shells</h2>
<p>But Disney hit a problem when it came to the artwork. Mermaids, of course, are typically bare-breasted, but so too were traditional depictions of Andersen’s ‘little’ mermaid, including the statue in Copenhagen’s harbour.</p>

<p>There is not a single illustration to the fairy tale pre-Disney that shows her wearing anything at all over her chest – in the case of Heath Robinson, <a href="http://sforsnail.blogspot.co.uk/2012/02/little-mermaid.html" target="_blank">this emphasises the ‘Little’ part</a>, as the mermaid is clearly a child in his illustrations.</p>

To make it completely clear, in the course of the film Ariel declares to her father (a familiar refrain) &#8216;I&#8217;m sixteen years old. I&#8217;m not a child.&#8217;</p>
<p>But however innocently naked (and animated) the Little Mermaid might be, Disney certainly could not show a sixteen year old’s breasts on screen. Their solution to this problem was the creation of a purple bra made out of shells &#8211; a new mermaid first.</p>
<p>When coupled with the waistband-like arrangement at the top of her tail (another innovation, since traditionally the mermaid’s scales segue gradually from the skin at her waist), this decision had the effect of creating a kind of mermaid bikini that implies she might just be wearing an elaborate two-piece – one very similar, in fact, to the <a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Jasmine.jpg" target="_blank">ensemble worn by Princess Jasmine</a> in Disney’s next film, <strong>Aladdin</strong>. And, of course, it also has the effect of emphasising breasts and hips either side of a tiny waist.</p>
<p>The Barbie-style Ariel doll I had as a child had (as modern-day packaging still asserts) &#8216;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Disney-Princess-Ariel-Doll---/dp/B003V02BOO/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1365004666&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=ariel+doll" target="_blank">removable clothes for costume change</a>&#8216;, so it was clear she was a two-legged being with an optional tail.</p>
<p>This has the effect of making the transition from mermaid to human much easier: in Andersen’s story, creating two legs out of one fish tail is exactly as vicious as you would expect it to be, and the draught the mermaid drinks to effect this causes the sensation of ‘a two-edged sword [passing] through her delicate body’ – so severe she passes out. Throughout her subsequent time on land, each foot she puts to the ground feels like ‘treading upon the points of needles or sharp knives’.</p>
<p>Bodily mutilation – indeed, mortification – is everywhere in Andersen&#8217;s story. After everyone is asleep, the mermaid goes to ‘sit on the broad marble steps [of the palace] for it eased her burning feet to bathe them in the cold sea-water’. Significantly &#8211; and somewhat bizarrely &#8211; such mutilation has been an ongoing problem for the Copenhagen representation of Andersen&#8217;s mermaid: the statue in the harbour has been blown up, decapitated (twice) and had its arm sawn off, in addition to many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Mermaid_(statue)#Vandalism" target="_blank">petty acts of vandalism</a> since its erection in 1913.</p>
<h2>Some liberation?</h2>
<p>By contrast with Andersen&#8217;s difficult transition, Ariel’s easy-on, easy-off fish tail and bikini bra combo not only ‘re-opens’ the traditional closed mermaid vessel, it also sexualises the teenage mermaid in a manner markedly different from anything in Andersen’s original (where the mermaid’s love is increased by knowledge of the prince’s good deeds, and her longing for a soul).</p>

<p>By censoring Ariel, Disney draws attention to her body and breasts, so she resembles a California surfer girl. The nakedness, which in earlier illustrations was straightforward and childlike, takes on an explicitly sexual edge (for more on this, have a look at this piece <a href="http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/rrMermaids.html" target="_blank">by Virginia Borges</a>).</p>
<p>The result is that Disney’s <strong>Little Mermaid</strong> becomes the straightforward tale of a sixteen-year-old struggling with her father for the right to explore her burgeoning sexuality and go out with a boy. And because she ultimately uses this right to make a good marriage (wearing <a href="http://disney-clipart.com/wedding/princesses/Wedding-Ariel-Eric-Bride-Groom.jpg" target="_blank">something strikingly similar</a> to <a href="http://www.blogcdn.com/royalwedding.aol.com/media/2011/03/princess-diana-wedding-dresses294.jpg" target="_blank">the dress worn by the equally speechless Princess Diana</a> at her 1981 marriage), Ariel makes good in the end and everyone is happy.</p>
<p>Like most of the Disney Renaissance heroines, hers is the story of a successful transition from the rule of the father to the rule of the husband.</p>
<h2>Other mermaids</h2>
<p>But it’s interesting that at the same time the producers were working on a heteronormative middle-class fantasy idea, their musical wunderkind Howard Ashman (despite dying of what, at the time, was popularly cast as a very non-family-friendly disease) was injecting some Broadway pizzazz into the soundtrack. This included the introduction of a deviantly-styled figure like Divine via the character of Ursula, the Sea Witch (though of course she is defeated, as does not happen in Andersen).</p>
<p>In fact, as the Disney Renaissance got going, the calibre of stars from distinctly non-Disney backgrounds increased: <strong>The Lion King</strong>, the Renaissance nadir, had major Broadway stars alongside A-list Hollywood stars, and the cast included black and Latino actors – something that had not even been considered back in the Forties (when Uncle Walt wanted some racial-caricature ‘Jim Crow’ figures in <strong>Dumbo</strong>, the crows were voiced by white men doing their best ‘black man’ impression instead). The staff list at the Disney studios was full of Jewish and homosexual figures like Ashman. Yet <strong>The Little Mermaid</strong> ushered in some of the most socially conservative films Disney produced. A strange duality.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TRIGGER WARNING:</strong> This segment of the Hopeless Reimantic series deals with some themes which may be triggering to abuse/harassment survivors, and some of the authors discussed within play it seriously fast and loose with the concept of consent.</p>
<p>Welcome back to <strong>Hopeless Reimantic</strong>, where I try to convince you all that my taste in books isn&#8217;t really that bad!</p>
<p>First of all, some housekeeping: er, it&#8217;s been a while since I last put out one of these, so sorry about that. My degree sort of ate me (final year), and it stands to swallow me whole again in a couple of weeks (FINAL YEEEAR), but I promise to get back to some kind of regular posting schedule in the summer.</p>
<p>Alright! Let&#8217;s talk about alpha males. Specifically, let&#8217;s talk about how spurious science has constructed a cultural narrative in which the expectation of alpha-dom has been projected onto men. Even <em>more</em> specifically, let&#8217;s talk about what that means in romance novels, because the Alpha Male (see also &#8220;alphahole&#8221; and &#8220;alphole&#8221;) of Romancelandia is a different specimen to the kind uplifted by, say, economy theorists. Or PUAs.</p>
<p>This in itself is kind of interesting to me, to be honest, because I encounter a lot of guys (and I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m not the only person to have experienced this) who say that they feel they <em>need</em> to alpha it on up because that, secretly, is what women want.<sup><a href="/2013/04/23/hopeless-reimantic-3-pack-mentality/#footnote_0_13502" id="identifier_0_13502" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" Ed&rsquo;s Tiny Note: And indeed you can read two early BR &lsquo;WTF is this alpha male business all about?&rsquo; posts from Sarah C here and Stephen B here! ">1</a></sup></p>
<p>At first glance, you&#8217;d see that pretty well backed up by the sheer overwhelming presence of the alpha male in romance novels. You don&#8217;t even have to delve into a Mills and Boon backlist to see it; take <strong>Fifty Shades of Grey</strong>. Christian Grey is arrogant, and controlling, and he gets what he wants. He&#8217;s tormented, angsty, abusive and stalkerish (but only in a really hot way), <em>and</em> he&#8217;s richer than God, better-looking than the most virile of the Vikings and carries his own name-brand popsicles around in case you happen to get thirsty when you&#8217;re going down on him.</p>
<p>A Mills and Boon backlist will show you a lot more of the same, though. This brand of alpha male is raw power in a designer suit; he mixes pure, unbridled Man with all the trappings of high civilisation, because his power is such that he can dominate any world he wants to. Often he&#8217;s risen up from humble beginnings or has some kind of connection with a criminal underworld, just so you know he&#8217;s a badass.</p>
<p>A different breed of alpha male emphasises the badass aspect over the size of the wallet. One of the most popular alpha males in recent releases is Kane &#8220;Tack&#8221; Allen, hero of Kristen Ashley&#8217;s <strong>Motorcycle Man</strong>. Now, my experience of Ashley has largely come through reading reviews of her work, but I did check out <strong>Motorcycle Man</strong>, and I might take a look through her back catalogue with a view to devoting a post on her at some point. Not because I&#8217;m a particular fan, but because her books &#8211; and their wild success &#8211; have caused quite a stir among the romance-reading community, and I think that deserves some scrutiny.</p>
<p>Some people vociferously dislike them, while others compare them to literary crack (there is a <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/group/show/66492-kristen-ashley-addict-s-support-group" target="_blank">Kristen Ashley Addicts Support Group</a>). At any rate, she specialises in this certain type of alpha, and Tack is a perfect example of it. He&#8217;s bad, he&#8217;s brawny, and he&#8217;s terrific in bed (he gives Tyra, our heroine, &#8220;so many orgasms I lost count&#8221;). Let&#8217;s take a look at him:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dark, longish, somewhat unruly, definitely sexy hair with a hint of gray interspersed in it. Blue eyes with pale lines radiating from the sides that I knew, I just knew, came from laughing. A dark goatee around his mouth, the bit at his chin overlong in a biker way that was too cool for words. Fantastic tattoos slithering up his defined arms, broad shoulders and muscled neck along with one on his ripped chest and a big one on his back. The rest of his body hard and strong&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8211; Kristen Ashley, <strong>Motorcycle Man</strong>, Kindle location 87.</p></blockquote>
<p>He also embodies alphadom, as, in my understanding, Ashley heroes tend to. I gave up highlighting all the stereotypical alpha behaviours he displayed that I found creepy, because the book&#8217;s quite long, but I when I looked at all the ones I&#8217;d taken, I still had twenty-four. I lost count of all the times he backed her into something or grabbed hold of her and she told him to back off and he wouldn&#8217;t. And he always gets what he wants:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;To be fair, I&#8217;m givin&#8217; you a warning,&#8221; he said quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me go,&#8221; I demanded just as quietly, mostly because I was freaking out.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want somethin&#8217;, I get it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me go,&#8221; I repeated.</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>Motorcycle Man</strong>, Kindle location 498</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m going to try to not quote this book too heavily, but I could, because there are a lot of informatively creepy passages in it. One last one, though, because it&#8217;s important. He manhandles her and tells her what to do and in the end she is happy with it because deep down, it&#8217;s what she wants. So far, so adherent to PUA theory. What Ashley enthusiasts &#8211; and alpha fans in general &#8211; would argue makes that sexy and not creepy is that he <em>knows</em> it&#8217;s what she wants. That is the nature of their connection: that he knows what she wants, even when she doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<blockquote><p>My arms were crushed between our bodies and I uncurled my fingers from his tee and pressed them flat against his chest as I whispered, &#8220;Please, get off me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You want this,&#8221; he informed me.</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>MM</strong>, Kindle location 1258.</p></blockquote>
<p>And, more explicitly, here:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;&#8230;the minute you gave me more of you, I took it, wanted even more and I didn&#8217;t keep that a secret, babe, and you fuckin&#8217; know it. And you kept givin&#8217; it. You coulda walked away and you didn&#8217;t. And along the way as we&#8217;ve been playin&#8217; our game, you got your hooks in me and I got mine in you and you know that too.&#8221;</p>
<p>I definitely did if the heartache I&#8217;d experienced the last two days was anything to go by.</p>
<p>But I wasn&#8217;t going to tell him that.</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>MM</strong>, Kindle location 3248.</p></blockquote>
<p>The way I&#8217;ve heard this described is that creating a good alpha hero demands a certain skill on the part of the author. If he&#8217;s going to dominate the heroine, then the reader needs to be assured that said heroine is in safe hands, and that reassurance is the author&#8217;s job. We must be sure that nothing the heroine isn&#8217;t okay with is going to happen to her, and readers that are content that the author (and thus the hero) is acting on behalf of the heroine&#8217;s best interests tend to be more willing to forgive things like non-consent. Her protests are part of the journey the story takes you on, because &#8211; well, you know she&#8217;s going to be okay.</p>
<p>This is key, and it&#8217;s something I find both reassuring and deeply troubling. On the one hand, I do find the assumption on the part of non-romance readers that the scenarios portrayed in these books are what their readers actually want or believe that they want kind of condescending. These people have brains in their heads like anybody else, and I don&#8217;t see many defenders of these books arguing that this is what they feel real life ought to be like. Some do, but not many that I&#8217;ve encountered.</p>
<p>The fantasy-escapism aspect of the work is lost on pretty much nobody, and I find it very strange that people don&#8217;t assume for other genres that it is. Do you put down a crime novel hoping you&#8217;re going to find a dead body in your garage? Fantasy fans might daydream about riding to war on the back of a dragon (I know I have) but I don&#8217;t think many people are seriously all that blind to the reality of what that might entail in a real-world context. Very few people would want to be placed in a fantasy scenario with the security of the story stripped away.</p>
<p>On the other hand&#8230;</p>
<p>I do understand the reservations non-romance-novel readers have about this kind of scenario being so widely marketed. There&#8217;s a crucial difference between, say, a crime thriller and a story about two people falling in love. Being a detective figuring out the culprit of a murder: well, that only happens to a very specific set of people. Falling in love happens all the time, everywhere, to people of all kinds and from all walks of life. A huge part of the appeal of romance and romantic plotlines is the near-universality of the experience. A lot of people are going to find the feelings described as part of that process relatable, even if the way it&#8217;s happening isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Which means that the boundary between fantasy-escapism and &#8220;this is the kind of thing I should look for in the world around me&#8221; is a lot easier to blur. The idea of a partner knowing what you want before you do, for example, has seeped into culture to an alarming degree, as anybody who&#8217;s picked up a women&#8217;s magazine will be able to tell you. <strong>Fifty Shades</strong> has pushed BDSM into the mainstream in a big way by marketing it as romantic. And there is no getting away from the fact that the normalisation of unhealthy relationship power dynamics in mainstream culture and mainstream romance feed off one another, and that is a process which is going to continue until the romance industry and the rest of mainstream culture recognise that it is happening.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have an easy answer for this one, honestly; it&#8217;s something I am still struggling with, and I&#8217;m running out of column space. It&#8217;s not for me or anybody else to tell people what they should be fantasising about, and I&#8217;m not sure that demanding clear delineations between &#8220;realistically romantic&#8221; and &#8220;don&#8217;t try this at home, kids!&#8221; in romance novels is either practically viable or particularly useful.</p>
<p>But the fact remains that some of this stuff <em>is </em>harmful, and its harmfulness, I find, gets dismissed by romance novel readers as &#8220;it&#8217;s just fantasy, it hurts no one!&#8221; and by non-romance novel readers as &#8220;it&#8217;s just romance novels, they&#8217;re too stupid to know any better!&#8221;. This is something that deserves deeper consideration and more frank discussion, whether you&#8217;re a fan of the romance novel or not.</p>
<p>Eesh, and I didn&#8217;t even get to any actual wolf packs! I&#8217;m sorry, paranormal genre. I&#8217;ll cover you someday, I promise.</p>
<p>What do you guys think? Do you like a bit of alphole in your hero? When does a book cross the line between fantastical goodness and creepy-ass weirdness?</p>
<p>Join me next time on Hopeless Reimantic, where I&#8217;ll be talking about&#8230;<em>marriage!</em> See you then.</p>

<p>In the dim and distant past, I edited an original anthology of horror stories called <strong>Skin of the Soul</strong>. Most of the stories were new (there were two reprints) and all of the contributors were women. What sparked my decision to do it was an all-male horror anthology published a couple of years earlier to much acclaim: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Evil_(anthology)" target="_blank"><strong>Prime Evil</strong></a>, edited by Douglas E. Winter, was a showcase for “the masters of modern horror”, and Winter’s introduction was dedicated to the argument that horror is not a genre but an emotion, to be found throughout all literature,from high to low.</p>

<p>I agree; I don’t care much for generic “horror”, even if I prefer it to generic “romance”, and although I’ve written a lot of horror stories, and most of my novels have some element of horror in them (one, <strong>Lost Futures</strong>, published as horror in the US, was nominated for a science fiction award in Britain) I’m not that comfortable identifying myself as a “horror writer”.</p>
<p>The writers Winter invited to contribute to his anthology included nearly all the big names of the time (Stephen King, Peter Straub, Clive Barker) but also lesser-known writers (Jack Cady and Paul Hazel). Even the introduction, pointing to the many sources of horror in the mainstream, gave a name-check to just one woman writer throughout literary history.</p>
<p>Who was this paragon? You might guess Mary Shelley, Emily Bronte, Christina Rossetti, Edith Wharton, Patricia Highsmith, Shirley Jackson, Anne Rice, Joyce Carol Oates&#8230; but no, the solitary example the editor chose was “&#8230;the best-selling novels of V.C. Andrews.” (I did wonder if he knew her first name was Virginia rather than, say, Victor.)</p>
<p>So I was horrified – not in a good way – by this compilation of horrors, and daydreamed about selling my own anthology, inviting a list of excellent writers to contribute, writing my own erudite introduction about great horror fiction of the past. If anyone pointed out that all of those writers were women, I’d act surprised, pretend it was just the luck of the draw, these were the best stories submitted and naturally the examples I chose were my personal favourites.</p>

I certainly did not set out to deliberately exclude men; there were lots of good male writers, but now that I came to think about it, not many of them wrote horror. I mean real horror, genuinely well-written and original, not that childish gross-out stuff, not those tired generic clichés, not dreary old male fantasies, but the kind of thing I wanted to read, because, after all, it only counts as horror in my book if it fits my definition&#8230; and I reserve the right to change the rules whenever I like.</p>
<p>Over years of going to conventions, and reading and writing and reviewing (even teaching classes) in the fields of science fiction, fantasy and horror, I’ve noticed how much time is devoted to definitions of genre. Any genre. Once you start putting labels on books, you must justify the inclusion of one and the exclusion of another. This is science fiction, of which I approve, while that is merely fantasy. (I remember Charles Platt defending his choice of interviewees for his first <strong>Who Writes Science Fiction?</strong> – Kate Wilhelm was the only woman, and she was interviewed in tandem with her husband – but, he explained, Ursula LeGuin had refused his request, and he couldn’t think of any other woman who wrote what he considered to be proper science fiction.)</p>

<p>Critics may praise authors who “push the boundaries” or subvert expectations, but these are the very actions that can make the dedicated genre fan feel cheated, and respond angrily, as if when they ordered chocolate ice cream, they’d been served a bowl of extra-hot chilli.</p>
<p>When, more than twenty years after the publication of <strong>Skin of the Soul</strong> (“which proves indisputably that horror fiction is not a male preserve”, or so said Clive Barker in 1990) , I find that women are still fighting that old battle, still having their contributions to horror ignored or forgotten, I wonder if this isn’t – at least partly – something to do with definitions and expectations of genre. And with who is defining it, and why.</p>
<p>Myself, I’ve never limited my reading to one type of fiction, and I don’t write novels that fall neatly into a narrowly defined slot, either. (Maybe this is my problem!) There are some readers for whom genre fiction is comfort food, and they don’t want any nasty surprises when they’ve snuggled down to read – even in a genre celebrated as the purveyor of nasty surprises. Maybe, for some readers, it doesn’t count as horror unless the author plays by certain rules, unless the story is purveyed via the male gaze, and the name on the title page does nothing to break the illusion that we’re all boys together in this clubhouse.</p>
