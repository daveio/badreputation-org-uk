<p><strong>CONTENT NOTE:</strong> Discussions herein of sexual assault, dubious consent, mental health treated badly, homophobia, biphobia and slut-shaming. Oh, and plenty of spoilers.</p>
<p>Welcome back to <strong>Hopeless Reimantic Presents</strong>! <a href="/2013/12/04/hopeless-reimantic-presents-anita-blake-vampire-hunter-part-one" target="_blank">Last time we got our teeth into <strong>Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter</strong></a>, and I found myself actually saying some pretty positive things about the books. (Honestly, I&#8217;m as surprised as you. My fourteen-year-old self is throwing one hell of a sulk.) It&#8217;s not the full story, though, and there&#8217;s still quite a lot about this series to unpack.</p>
<p>First of all, there&#8217;s something I need to make clear: as I said in <a href="/2013/12/04/hopeless-reimantic-presents-anita-blake-vampire-hunter-part-one" target="_blank">Part One</a>, I went into this review determined not to talk about the series in relation to Laurell K. Hamilton herself more than was necessary.</p>
<p>I generally hold that unless an author has done something that I can&#8217;t reconcile myself to morally, I don&#8217;t feel like it&#8217;s my business to talk about their personal life when I am supposed to be reviewing their books. And from what I&#8217;ve read of Laurell K. Hamilton&#8217;s blog posts, she seems kind of entitled and I find her annoying, but&#8230;well, let&#8217;s just say that as far as I can tell she&#8217;s no Orson Scott Card. By and large my problems with the ideas she puts across can easily be expressed in criticism of her work rather than criticism of her.</p>
<p>I ran into some problems with this approach, to be sure; the evidence for Anita Blake being the author&#8217;s avatar is pretty compelling. But for the purposes of analysing the text, I&#8217;m putting that debate to bed. From here on out, guys, they&#8217;re just books, so if anyone is reading this expecting it to be a catalogue of Ms Hamilton&#8217;s character flaws, well, it&#8217;s not going to be. Hashtag sorry not sorry, or something.</p>
<p>Oh, one more thing: I&#8217;m limiting myself to a maximum of one book quotation per point here, because SEVENTEEN BOOKS LORD HAVE MERCY.</p>
<p>Okay! Let&#8217;s get started. Where were we? Was I wanting to tear my eyes out? I think I was wanting to tear my eyes out.</p>
<p>&#8230;I&#8217;m going to need to slip into a more concise format, I think, or that&#8217;s just going to be the entire article. Here, then, in no particular order, are My Main Problems with Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter:</p>
<h3>1) Anita only has one dating experience that I would describe as fully consensual.</h3>
<p>She dates Richard, a werewolf, and then she gets engaged to Richard, and <em>then</em> the vampire she&#8217;s been hanging out with decides that he needs &#8220;equal time&#8221; to win her over, or he&#8217;s got no choice but to duel Richard to the death:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;You have dated him for months, and I have said little. Before you marry him, I want equal time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been trying to avoid you for months. I&#8217;m not just going to give in now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I will start the music, and we will dance. Even if I die, and you die. Richard will die first, I can promise you that. Surely dating me is not a fate worse than death.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8211; Laurell K. Hamilton, <strong>The Lunatic Cafe</strong>, p.221.</p></blockquote>
<p>(I&#8217;m not so sure about that, dude.)</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also the shapeshifter leopard who basically just rapes her (it&#8217;s okay, she enjoys it) and then is her mate and it&#8217;s all fine, and the other shapeshifter leopard who is Terrifyingly Submissive at her until she gives in (more on that later). These are her four main men and, last I checked, the various loves of her life.</p>
<p>There are a couple of things at play here, and I can intellectually grasp them both. One is that an easy way to add darkness and tension to a story is to have your main character interact with a world which doesn&#8217;t recognise their morality, which is how we get all those kind of racist &#8220;I was ravished by a barbarian/sheikh/otherwise rich and dark-skinned man&#8221; stories (remind me to talk to you about <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2180276.The_Panther_and_the_Pearl" target="_blank"><strong>The Panther And The Pearl</strong></a> some time). And that&#8217;s not necessarily a bad thing in a fantasy world where you are dealing with beings that might have witnessed the greater part of human history. I do take the point that you might well not care so much about pesky human morals when you&#8217;ve been living off blood or sex or male tears or whatever for about a thousand years.</p>
<p>And, credit where it&#8217;s due, Laurell K. Hamilton does make some effort to deal with the effect this is having on Anita; she agonises, at least initially, over the detachment she feels from her humanity as she gets drawn deeper into the preternatural world. Hamilton doesn&#8217;t really take that conflict anywhere, which is a shame because it makes the whole thing feel a bit too insta-conflict for my liking, but she tries.</p>
<p>The considerably more disturbing thing is the second point, which is that this is supposed to be <em>hot</em>. We&#8217;ve touched on this before in <a href="/2013/04/23/hopeless-reimantic-3-pack-mentality/" target="_blank">the column on alpha males</a>, but one thing that I think I missed there is actually what I find grossest about this particular fantasy &#8211; that being threatened or coerced, either physically or by other means, into being with someone is supposed to be evidence of part of a woman&#8217;s power and mystique. It&#8217;s not that these guys are proto-rapists, no &#8211; it&#8217;s that women are so damned irresistible that they overwhelm men&#8217;s judgement and common sense. Basically, they are the full moon to every man&#8217;s <a href="http://pervocracy.blogspot.co.uk/2012/08/the-myth-of-boner-werewolf.html" target="_blank">boner werewolf</a> (link NSFW).</p>
<p>There is an element of pick-up artistry that states that when you overcome LMR (last minute resistance, usually to sex) you&#8217;re actually doing the woman a favour, because you&#8217;re taking the responsibility out of her hands. She can&#8217;t be a slut, because she&#8217;s not in control; you&#8217;re preserving her purity while still giving her the sex she wants. That is gross and messed-up and a terrible bit of rape apologia, but it&#8217;s the same kind of logic that I&#8217;m seeing here; it&#8217;s a way to skirt around having Anita own her own sexuality. She can&#8217;t help it! She&#8217;s just got this <em>energy</em>!</p>
<p>And on that note&#8230;</p>
<h3>2) There&#8217;s hella slut-shaming.</h3>
<p>It took me a while to realise this. I started out with <strong>Danse Macabre</strong>, but the more of these books I read, the more I became convinced that having lots of sex was only okay for Anita Blake, and by extension her harem of men, because Anita Blake has sex because she somehow <em>has</em> to &#8211; which is a pretty icky sentence to begin with, by the way. </p>
<p>Anita starts out the series not believing in pre-marital sex. She ends up having quite a lot of it, but there&#8217;s never a sense that she revises that belief, which would be really interesting if it didn&#8217;t have such weird implications for the other women in the books. Anita has sex because of deep love, a deep sense of obligation (erk) and/or because she is a succubus. Metaphysical events or very strong emotion compel her to bone, and the fact that she ends up enjoying it immensely is somehow a coincidence, which is possibly the strangest permutation of the forced seduction trope I&#8217;ve ever seen. </p>
<p>And even that would be okay, were it not for the fact that every single other woman in the books who has sex for such a frivolous reason as the fact she just enjoys it is painted as either a) shallow and heinous, b) mentally unstable, or c) both.</p>
<p>Which brings me neatly to:</p>
<h3>3) There is gratuitous use of mental illness as a plot device.</h3>
<p>Basically every villain is crazy. And there&#8217;s Nathaniel, her second shapeshifter love interest, who is super-submissive and utterly traumatised by his past and hey, did we mention he&#8217;s kinky too and can take more pain than anybody else? Because he&#8217;s damaged?</p>
<p>Urgh. If I had to hazard, I&#8217;d say this follows a lot of the same logic that we see in point 1), but let&#8217;s just be honest here; this isn&#8217;t just offensive, it&#8217;s lazy writing, in the same way that blaming serious criminal offences or terrorism on mental illness is lazy journalism. It&#8217;s a way to avoid grappling seriously with what could actually be some pretty compelling issues and it&#8217;s depressing me. So let&#8217;s move on to our final point:</p>
<h3>4) Gender essentialism and homophobia.</h3>
<p>Hoo boy.</p>
<p>This is a pretty interesting one, actually, because the characters around Anita Blake actually call her on some of it, and it doesn&#8217;t work. I skipped a quotation for mental illness and point 2, so we can have two in here because it&#8217;s my column and I make the rules.</p>
<p>I feel like I need to include this one because it&#8217;s in <strong>Shutdown</strong>, which was actually only released <a href="http://www.laurellkhamilton.org/2013/10/shutdown-press-release/" target="_blank">a few weeks ago</a> &#8211; and, again, in fairness to Ms Hamilton, releasing it the way she did was a nice idea (it was a freebie because of the US government shutdown, in solidarity with government workers who were off without pay). </p>
<p>The story itself is interesting purely because the premise is so flawed: Richard, Anita Blake&#8217;s erstwhile lover, now-Top, is engaged to another woman, and apparently has chosen only now to mention to her that he&#8217;s poly and wants to see other people for wild kinky sex. His fiancee has a problem with this &#8211; not, you understand, because somehow <em>they have got as far as being engaged without this ever having come up</em>, but because she&#8217;s a crazy jealous harpy who can&#8217;t wrap her narrow mind around non-monogamy or sex that isn&#8217;t vanilla. </p>
<p>I liked precisely nobody in this short, but Anita least of all:</p>
<blockquote><p>I hadn&#8217;t had to endure this much small talk in years. We&#8217;d learned a lot about one another, but unless we were looking to date, I didn&#8217;t see the point.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Men understood that sometimes you didn&#8217;t want to smile, but you weren&#8217;t mad either, while women expect other women to be pleasant, and if you&#8217;re not they think you don&#8217;t like them. There are so many reasons that most of my friends are men. </p>
<p>&#8211; Laurell K. Hamilton, <strong>Shutdown</strong>, pp.6-8</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh, Ms Blake, you charmer. I could quote this little piece all day, actually, because it shows you a lot about the mess of contradictions that is gender portrayal in these books, but &#8211; you guys, I can&#8217;t. I just can&#8217;t. I think my brain is leaking out of my ears.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s finish up, then, with one final quote, and my witty and insightful riposte.</p>
<p>Look, okay, this isn&#8217;t even close to the most homophobia I&#8217;ve ever seen in fiction, or the worst. I&#8217;ll give you that I really do think this was&#8230; misguided, but well-intentioned. For what that&#8217;s worth. But the fact remains that I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve seen a non-heterosexual character in the Anita Blake series who wasn&#8217;t sex-obsessed, mentally ill (see above) and/or just plain old mean. </p>
<p>Anita Blake herself later gets a girlfriend and starts identifying as &#8220;heteroflexible&#8221;, which is a completely valid label that I don&#8217;t wish to detract from, but in this case reads to me sort of like she&#8217;s just started adding &#8220;no homo&#8221; to the end of all of her sentences about fancying women.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s&#8230;well, this. For context: some of Anita&#8217;s male partners are bisexual. She has just had a threesome with one of them and another man, which she feels gives her incontrovertible proof that he is, in fact, also into guys. The other men around her do not seem bothered by this revelation. Which prompts the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In college I had a friend, a girlfriend, a girl who was a friend. She and I went shopping together. Slept over at each other&#8217;s dorm rooms. I undressed in front of her because she was a girl. Then toward the end of college she told me she was gay. We were still friends, but she went into that guy category for me. You don&#8217;t undress in front of people who see you as a sex object. You don&#8217;t sleep with them, or&#8230;oh, hell.&#8221; I looked up at Micah. &#8220;Won&#8217;t it weird you out to sleep nude beside him now?&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8211; Laurell K. Hamilton, <strong>Danse Macabre</strong>, p.188.</p></blockquote>
<p>Funny story: my original response to this paragraph was a lot more colourful. I&#8217;m going to try and discuss it briefly, coherently and without expletives.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure which bothers me more, here: the idea that being attracted to members of one gender means you&#8217;re attracted to <em>all</em> members of one gender, or Anita&#8217;s assumption that everybody around her is going to have the same weird hang-ups as she is. I will say, though, that reading this made me briefly see red. You can come hang out with my friends, Anita Blake&#8217;s token lesbian college friend! They&#8217;ll hug you! Even the straight women!</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m struggling to articulate is why, exactly, this paragraph was the exact point that I fully lost patience with the series, because in context it&#8217;s not actually so bad. Anita is laughed at for her small-mindedness, and they all go to sleep naked and it&#8217;s fine.</p>
<p>Except&#8230;</p>
<p>Except that <em>this never really goes away</em>. There&#8217;s a kind of false normal here that you&#8217;re not supposed to stray from, and then even when Anita does, all that happens it that it gets this veneer of &#8220;exotic sexy sex stuff&#8221; that makes the books transgressive and naughty. It doesn&#8217;t read like a straight-up sex fantasy. I definitely don&#8217;t buy that it&#8217;s an honest exploration of sexuality in fiction. I&#8217;m not even sure that it&#8217;s Laurell K. Hamilton bragging about her sex life with extra fantasy elements.</p>
<p>The best way I can describe it is that it reads like a zoo exhibit, if people who have a lot of sex could actually literally <em>be</em> zoo exhibits. It doesn&#8217;t challenge normative attitudes, is what I&#8217;m saying. It takes the stuff Ms Hamilton describes as &#8220;too underground for the mainstream&#8221; and sticks it behind a thick layer of societal assumptions-reinforced glass, so that you can look at it without getting your brain too into all the sex stuff. And then you can go home at the end feeling like you&#8217;ve learned something. And perhaps a little icky.</p>
<p>And that brings us to the end of <strong>Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter</strong>. If you enjoyed this column and want me to do more like it, consider dropping me a comment, because the experience was&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;it was&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;it&#8217;s been an experience, guys. And now, if you&#8217;ll excuse me, I&#8217;m off to read something else. Something gentle, with no sex in it whatsoever. Maybe some Catherynne M. Valente.</p>
<p>See you next time!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[When the call came around for horror-themed posts for autumn and winter, I decided to take on the Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter series.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Early December. The leaves have fallen, the sky has darkened. Rain lashes the windows. Doors yawn open before you; blackness whispers chill secrets into your hair, and your worst nightmares take shape &#8216;twixt the smoky trees, taunting, menacing. Waiting.</p>
<p>Basically, at the time of writing it was the month with Hallowe&#8217;en in it, and I hate to waste a perfectly good theme. So without further ado, allow me to welcome you to <strong>Hopeless Reimantic Presents</strong>! In this column I&#8217;ll be going in-depth into the works of specific authors who are in &#8211; or cross over into &#8211; the romance genre. In the spirit of the season, I thought we&#8217;d take a look at the stuff of nightmares: let&#8217;s talk about Laurell K. Hamilton. More specifically, let&#8217;s talk about <strong>Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter</strong>, one of the weirdest and most controversial series I&#8217;ve ever interacted with.</p>

<p>First of all, a slightly complicated preface. Before I ever picked up an Anita Blake book I knew quite a lot about them, and while I&#8217;d like to stress that I&#8217;m here to talk about the <em></em>books and <em>not</em> Ms Hamilton herself I feel like I&#8217;ll be remiss if I don&#8217;t at least give a quick summary of some common controversies surrounding the series and its author.</p>
<p>I first became aware of Laurell K. Hamilton via Anne Rice. Well, not Anne Rice herself, but <a href="http://www.journalfen.net/community/fandom_wank/515245.html?nc=911" target="_blank">the now-infamous Anne Rice Author Tantrum</a>, which I arrived at a couple of years after the fact and consequently saw linked to&#8230;Laurell K. Hamilton&#8217;s <a href="http://eragon-sporkings.wikispaces.com/Hamiltons_Response_To_Negative_Readers" target="_blank">similarly poor handling of criticism</a> (link to a Wikispace article, as the original blog post has vanished).</p>
<p>Hamilton isn&#8217;t quite as vitriolic in her I Can&#8217;t Believe Not Everyone Likes My Book-ness, but she&#8217;s still pretty irritatingly condescending, although I do agree with her that if someone&#8217;s taking their book up to you so that you can sign it, then opening with &#8220;I hated this one and what you&#8217;ve done with the series&#8221; is kind of poor form.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s since made a name for herself on Twitter for calling her critics <a href="https://twitter.com/LKHamilton/status/200273311530360832" target="_blank">sexually frustrated</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/LKHamilton/status/200272147720056832" target="_blank">jealous</a> <a href="http://lkh-lashouts.livejournal.com/562684.html#cutid1" target="_blank">wannabes</a>, and a name for herself among readers and other writers for<a href="http://mybookgoggles.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/authors-behaving-badly-laurell-k.html" target="_blank"> not handling criticism well </a>and <a href="http://www.likesbooks.com/cgi-bin/bookReview.pl?BookReviewId=9647" target="_blank">shamelessly inserting herself into her books</a>. The <a href="http://lkh-lashouts.livejournal.com/" target="_blank">LKH_lashouts</a> community on LiveJournal keeps a nice catalogue of her various posts, blogs and misdemeanours, and I&#8217;ve been on it all day, which might explain why my brain is starting to feel too heavy for my skull.</p>
<p>As a lot of you probably aren&#8217;t familiar with what makes the Anita Blake series so divisive in the first place, I&#8217;ll give you a quick, neutral description to start us off (don&#8217;t worry, we&#8217;ll get to the incoherent ranting later). The <strong>Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter</strong> series started out as a kind of monster-of-the-week dealio, with some romance in it but not a huge deal. The romantic &#8211; and sexual &#8211; content of the books got a lot more page time as the series went on, and the tenth book in the series, <strong>Narcissus In Chains</strong>, saw a metaphysical event turn Anita Blake into a succubus who needs sex to survive.</p>
<p>Subsequent books are arguably more &#8220;paranormal erotica&#8221; than anything else, and the last time I checked in with Ms Blake she was in a polyamorous relationship with five guys and happy as a clam. This, and the fact that a lot of the events of Anita Blake&#8217;s love life seem to mirror the author&#8217;s, have led to accusations that Laurell K. Hamilton is using Anita to brag about how much sex she&#8217;s having, and have turned a lot of readers off the series.</p>
<p>The upshot of all this is that this time three months ago, your intrepid romance novel enthusiast knew <em>of</em> Laurell K. Hamilton and had formed a pretty strong impression of the <strong>Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter</strong> books &#8211; but had never actually picked one up. So when the call came around for horror-themed posts for autumn and winter, and I decided to take them on, I was&#8230;nervous, but excited. Here was a series with a strong female lead which had lost popularity as the erotic content had upped and the quality of the writing had deteriorated &#8211; the stuff of feminist bad-porn-lovers&#8217; wildest dreams, right?</p>
<p>All that given due consideration, I wanted to approach the series with an open mind, but I didn&#8217;t want to actually buy any of the books because a) this isn&#8217;t somebody I want to give money to and b) there are approximately bleventeen of the damned things and I don&#8217;t have a job. I put out a call on my social medias for donations to the cause.</p>
<p>Three weeks later, I had <em>seventeen Laurell K. Hamilton books</em>. And with various deadlines coming up? I had a week to read them in.</p>
<p>Some would have panicked. Some would have faltered. Some would have done several noisy circuits of the living room, sobbing about the hilarious injustice of life. Some would have said, &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s okay, I don&#8217;t have to read all of these, I&#8217;m not <em>that</em> much of a masochist&#8221;, picked out a selection, and called it a day.</p>
<p>I did all of these things except the last one. Here&#8217;s how I got on. The following are my initial notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Initial thoughts on LKH: The Anita Blake series is not as bad as I thought it would be for the reasons I was told I would hate it, but it is creepingly terrible in ways I didn&#8217;t really anticipate.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Day 3 of LKH immersion. Eyes gritty. Legs heavy. Some subcranial tenderness. Seem to have &#8220;What Does The Fox Say&#8221; stuck in my head.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Laurell K. Hamilton Immersion Week, Day 5. Sore throat, some muscle ache. Have been reading some of the earlier books, which are much better even if I don&#8217;t like murder mysteries that much. I&#8217;m sad that her deep love of stuffed penguins seems to be worn away by all the sexy sexy sex she starts having in a book or so&#8217;s time. What happened to Sigmund, Anita? Did Sigmund mean nothing to you? Developing protective feelings for all penguins.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>LKH Immersion Week, Day 6. I&#8230;I just don&#8217;t even know anymore, you guys. Just leave me alone. I&#8217;m going shopping for leather.</p></blockquote>
<p>By the end of the week I&#8217;d contracted a stomach virus, although the medical jury is still out on whether or not this was a symptom of my burgeoning lycanthropy. The next full moon isn&#8217;t until December 17th, so I guess we&#8217;ll find out then.</p>
<p>This is going to be a difficult bit of analysis to write, because &#8211; well, I read seventeen books, you guys. I&#8217;m having to be extremely choosy about which books I quote and why. Maybe I&#8217;ll upload a list of Supplementary Supportive Material, but, um, I wouldn&#8217;t count on it.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, dear readers, here&#8217;s the thing: <em>I didn&#8217;t hate these books the way I was expecting to</em>.</p>
<p>Look, fourteen-year-old me assumed I&#8217;d hate these books because they were a self-insert Mary-Sue-type series that ended with the main character having far too much ridiculously improbable sex and being the best at everything. Fourteen-year-old me was also scared of non-monogamy, kind of selective in her feminism and a lot more judgmental. Fourteen-year-old me would probably have written this bit of the article in a far more entertainingly vitriolic manner.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you&#8217;re stuck with twenty-three-year-old me, and twenty-three-year-old me doesn&#8217;t have a problem with any of these things on principle. Look, okay, self-insert Mary-Sues aren&#8217;t my cup of tea, and I can see why a sharp rise (hurr) in sexual content in a series which basically had no sexual content at all for the first four books might turn readers off &#8211; but those two facts don&#8217;t make either of those authorial decisions inherently wrong.</p>
<p>For all her flaws (and she has many &#8211; and I&#8217;m not just talking about the fun kind of flaws that make a character seem real, either) Anita Blake has some nice bits of refreshingly feminist outlook. One of the best story arcs in the series comes in <strong>Danse Macabre,</strong> when she has a pregnancy scare. She talks it over with all of her partners, one of them says he&#8217;ll stay at home and raise the baby so that she can keep working, and another says he&#8217;ll marry her:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Jesus, Mary and Joseph, Richard, is that all you think it takes to fix this? Marry me so the baby won&#8217;t be a bastard, and it&#8217;s all better?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see anyone else offering marriage,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s because they know I&#8217;ll say no. Every other man in my life understands that this isn&#8217;t about marriage. It&#8217;s about the fact that we may have created a little person. And we need to do whatever is best for that little person. How will marrying anyone make this work better? &#8230; What do you think having a baby will do to me, Richard? Do you think just because I have a baby I&#8217;ll become this other person? This softer, gentler person? Is that what you think?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8211; Laurell K. Hamilton, <strong>Danse Macabre</strong>, pp. 162-164</p></blockquote>
<p>Whatever else I think about Anita Blake the character, I wholeheartedly rooted for her throughout this story arc. Would it have been unrealistic for her to keep being a federal agent who has all the sex and also a baby? Sure, maybe. But this is a fantasy series and clearly delineated as such, so if that&#8217;s too much suspension of disbelief for you then <a href="http://fuckyeahscifiwomenofcolour.tumblr.com/post/37413846476/author-scott-lynch-responds-to-a-critic-of-the" target="_blank">allow me to refer you to Scott Lynch</a>.</p>
<p>Regarding the non-monogamy&#8230;well, there are not a lot of mainstream series that won&#8217;t even touch non-monogamy with a bargepole, and twenty-three-year-old me quite likes the normalisation of non-mono and monogamous relationships here. What I&#8217;m basically trying to say here is that if Laurell K. Hamilton wants to chronicle her sexy adventures as Badass The Vampire Slayer (And Harem) and people want to read it, I&#8217;m honestly okay with that. I wish she&#8217;d be more honest about what her books are (she seems to do a lot of If You Don&#8217;t Like It You&#8217;re Just Too Mainstream For My Awesomeness-ing), but &#8211; whatever. Fine.</p>
<p>However. The fact that I didn&#8217;t hate these books for the reasons I&#8217;d assumed doesn&#8217;t mean that they in no way made me want to tear my own eyes out. Unfortunately this article is skittering dangerously close to its word limit, so stand by for <strong>Part Two</strong>, in which I attempt to explain why cleanly and concisely but inevitably deteriorate into wordless, feeble sobbing.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t wait! See you then.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TRIGGER WARNING:</strong> This segment of the Hopeless Reimantic series deals with some themes which may be triggering to abuse/harassment survivors, and some of the authors discussed within play it seriously fast and loose with the concept of consent.</p>
<p>Welcome back to <strong>Hopeless Reimantic</strong>, where I try to convince you all that my taste in books isn&#8217;t really that bad!</p>
<p>First of all, some housekeeping: er, it&#8217;s been a while since I last put out one of these, so sorry about that. My degree sort of ate me (final year), and it stands to swallow me whole again in a couple of weeks (FINAL YEEEAR), but I promise to get back to some kind of regular posting schedule in the summer.</p>
<p>Alright! Let&#8217;s talk about alpha males. Specifically, let&#8217;s talk about how spurious science has constructed a cultural narrative in which the expectation of alpha-dom has been projected onto men. Even <em>more</em> specifically, let&#8217;s talk about what that means in romance novels, because the Alpha Male (see also &#8220;alphahole&#8221; and &#8220;alphole&#8221;) of Romancelandia is a different specimen to the kind uplifted by, say, economy theorists. Or PUAs.</p>
<p>This in itself is kind of interesting to me, to be honest, because I encounter a lot of guys (and I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m not the only person to have experienced this) who say that they feel they <em>need</em> to alpha it on up because that, secretly, is what women want.<sup><a href="/2013/04/23/hopeless-reimantic-3-pack-mentality/#footnote_0_13502" id="identifier_0_13502" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" Ed&rsquo;s Tiny Note: And indeed you can read two early BR &lsquo;WTF is this alpha male business all about?&rsquo; posts from Sarah C here and Stephen B here! ">1</a></sup></p>
<p>At first glance, you&#8217;d see that pretty well backed up by the sheer overwhelming presence of the alpha male in romance novels. You don&#8217;t even have to delve into a Mills and Boon backlist to see it; take <strong>Fifty Shades of Grey</strong>. Christian Grey is arrogant, and controlling, and he gets what he wants. He&#8217;s tormented, angsty, abusive and stalkerish (but only in a really hot way), <em>and</em> he&#8217;s richer than God, better-looking than the most virile of the Vikings and carries his own name-brand popsicles around in case you happen to get thirsty when you&#8217;re going down on him.</p>
<p>A Mills and Boon backlist will show you a lot more of the same, though. This brand of alpha male is raw power in a designer suit; he mixes pure, unbridled Man with all the trappings of high civilisation, because his power is such that he can dominate any world he wants to. Often he&#8217;s risen up from humble beginnings or has some kind of connection with a criminal underworld, just so you know he&#8217;s a badass.</p>
<p>A different breed of alpha male emphasises the badass aspect over the size of the wallet. One of the most popular alpha males in recent releases is Kane &#8220;Tack&#8221; Allen, hero of Kristen Ashley&#8217;s <strong>Motorcycle Man</strong>. Now, my experience of Ashley has largely come through reading reviews of her work, but I did check out <strong>Motorcycle Man</strong>, and I might take a look through her back catalogue with a view to devoting a post on her at some point. Not because I&#8217;m a particular fan, but because her books &#8211; and their wild success &#8211; have caused quite a stir among the romance-reading community, and I think that deserves some scrutiny.</p>
<p>Some people vociferously dislike them, while others compare them to literary crack (there is a <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/group/show/66492-kristen-ashley-addict-s-support-group" target="_blank">Kristen Ashley Addicts Support Group</a>). At any rate, she specialises in this certain type of alpha, and Tack is a perfect example of it. He&#8217;s bad, he&#8217;s brawny, and he&#8217;s terrific in bed (he gives Tyra, our heroine, &#8220;so many orgasms I lost count&#8221;). Let&#8217;s take a look at him:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dark, longish, somewhat unruly, definitely sexy hair with a hint of gray interspersed in it. Blue eyes with pale lines radiating from the sides that I knew, I just knew, came from laughing. A dark goatee around his mouth, the bit at his chin overlong in a biker way that was too cool for words. Fantastic tattoos slithering up his defined arms, broad shoulders and muscled neck along with one on his ripped chest and a big one on his back. The rest of his body hard and strong&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8211; Kristen Ashley, <strong>Motorcycle Man</strong>, Kindle location 87.</p></blockquote>
<p>He also embodies alphadom, as, in my understanding, Ashley heroes tend to. I gave up highlighting all the stereotypical alpha behaviours he displayed that I found creepy, because the book&#8217;s quite long, but I when I looked at all the ones I&#8217;d taken, I still had twenty-four. I lost count of all the times he backed her into something or grabbed hold of her and she told him to back off and he wouldn&#8217;t. And he always gets what he wants:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;To be fair, I&#8217;m givin&#8217; you a warning,&#8221; he said quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me go,&#8221; I demanded just as quietly, mostly because I was freaking out.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want somethin&#8217;, I get it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me go,&#8221; I repeated.</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>Motorcycle Man</strong>, Kindle location 498</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m going to try to not quote this book too heavily, but I could, because there are a lot of informatively creepy passages in it. One last one, though, because it&#8217;s important. He manhandles her and tells her what to do and in the end she is happy with it because deep down, it&#8217;s what she wants. So far, so adherent to PUA theory. What Ashley enthusiasts &#8211; and alpha fans in general &#8211; would argue makes that sexy and not creepy is that he <em>knows</em> it&#8217;s what she wants. That is the nature of their connection: that he knows what she wants, even when she doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<blockquote><p>My arms were crushed between our bodies and I uncurled my fingers from his tee and pressed them flat against his chest as I whispered, &#8220;Please, get off me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You want this,&#8221; he informed me.</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>MM</strong>, Kindle location 1258.</p></blockquote>
<p>And, more explicitly, here:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;&#8230;the minute you gave me more of you, I took it, wanted even more and I didn&#8217;t keep that a secret, babe, and you fuckin&#8217; know it. And you kept givin&#8217; it. You coulda walked away and you didn&#8217;t. And along the way as we&#8217;ve been playin&#8217; our game, you got your hooks in me and I got mine in you and you know that too.&#8221;</p>
<p>I definitely did if the heartache I&#8217;d experienced the last two days was anything to go by.</p>
<p>But I wasn&#8217;t going to tell him that.</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>MM</strong>, Kindle location 3248.</p></blockquote>
<p>The way I&#8217;ve heard this described is that creating a good alpha hero demands a certain skill on the part of the author. If he&#8217;s going to dominate the heroine, then the reader needs to be assured that said heroine is in safe hands, and that reassurance is the author&#8217;s job. We must be sure that nothing the heroine isn&#8217;t okay with is going to happen to her, and readers that are content that the author (and thus the hero) is acting on behalf of the heroine&#8217;s best interests tend to be more willing to forgive things like non-consent. Her protests are part of the journey the story takes you on, because &#8211; well, you know she&#8217;s going to be okay.</p>
<p>This is key, and it&#8217;s something I find both reassuring and deeply troubling. On the one hand, I do find the assumption on the part of non-romance readers that the scenarios portrayed in these books are what their readers actually want or believe that they want kind of condescending. These people have brains in their heads like anybody else, and I don&#8217;t see many defenders of these books arguing that this is what they feel real life ought to be like. Some do, but not many that I&#8217;ve encountered.</p>
<p>The fantasy-escapism aspect of the work is lost on pretty much nobody, and I find it very strange that people don&#8217;t assume for other genres that it is. Do you put down a crime novel hoping you&#8217;re going to find a dead body in your garage? Fantasy fans might daydream about riding to war on the back of a dragon (I know I have) but I don&#8217;t think many people are seriously all that blind to the reality of what that might entail in a real-world context. Very few people would want to be placed in a fantasy scenario with the security of the story stripped away.</p>
<p>On the other hand&#8230;</p>
<p>I do understand the reservations non-romance-novel readers have about this kind of scenario being so widely marketed. There&#8217;s a crucial difference between, say, a crime thriller and a story about two people falling in love. Being a detective figuring out the culprit of a murder: well, that only happens to a very specific set of people. Falling in love happens all the time, everywhere, to people of all kinds and from all walks of life. A huge part of the appeal of romance and romantic plotlines is the near-universality of the experience. A lot of people are going to find the feelings described as part of that process relatable, even if the way it&#8217;s happening isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Which means that the boundary between fantasy-escapism and &#8220;this is the kind of thing I should look for in the world around me&#8221; is a lot easier to blur. The idea of a partner knowing what you want before you do, for example, has seeped into culture to an alarming degree, as anybody who&#8217;s picked up a women&#8217;s magazine will be able to tell you. <strong>Fifty Shades</strong> has pushed BDSM into the mainstream in a big way by marketing it as romantic. And there is no getting away from the fact that the normalisation of unhealthy relationship power dynamics in mainstream culture and mainstream romance feed off one another, and that is a process which is going to continue until the romance industry and the rest of mainstream culture recognise that it is happening.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have an easy answer for this one, honestly; it&#8217;s something I am still struggling with, and I&#8217;m running out of column space. It&#8217;s not for me or anybody else to tell people what they should be fantasising about, and I&#8217;m not sure that demanding clear delineations between &#8220;realistically romantic&#8221; and &#8220;don&#8217;t try this at home, kids!&#8221; in romance novels is either practically viable or particularly useful.</p>
<p>But the fact remains that some of this stuff <em>is </em>harmful, and its harmfulness, I find, gets dismissed by romance novel readers as &#8220;it&#8217;s just fantasy, it hurts no one!&#8221; and by non-romance novel readers as &#8220;it&#8217;s just romance novels, they&#8217;re too stupid to know any better!&#8221;. This is something that deserves deeper consideration and more frank discussion, whether you&#8217;re a fan of the romance novel or not.</p>
<p>Eesh, and I didn&#8217;t even get to any actual wolf packs! I&#8217;m sorry, paranormal genre. I&#8217;ll cover you someday, I promise.</p>
<p>What do you guys think? Do you like a bit of alphole in your hero? When does a book cross the line between fantastical goodness and creepy-ass weirdness?</p>
<p>Join me next time on Hopeless Reimantic, where I&#8217;ll be talking about&#8230;<em>marriage!</em> See you then.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[That's right, folks: I'm talking about babies.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>For more about this series on Romance Novel Tropes, read <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/08/01/new-series-hopeless-reimantic/">Rei&#8217;s Hopeless Reimantic intro post</a> and <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/08/20/hopeless-reimantic-part-one-virginal-heroines/" target="_blank">Part 1: Virginal Heroines</a>.</em></p>
<p>(The author recognises that the phenomenon discussed below is not, in fact, limited to people who are married and in love. I&#8217;ll get to marriage in romance novels some other time.)</p>
<p>[<strong>TRIGGER WARNING:</strong> Discussion of infertility and failed pregnancies below.]</p>
<p>[<strong>SPOILER WARNING: </strong>This piece discusses happenings from the first and third episodes of the new season of <strong>Doctor Who</strong>, as well as containing mild spoilers for <strong>Game Of Thrones</strong>.]</p>
<p>Last time on <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/category/bookshelf/hopeless-reimantic-bookshelf/" target="_blank"><strong>Hopeless Reimantic</strong></a> we talked about virginal heroines, and while I wasn&#8217;t totally positive on the topic, I will give the virginal heroine this: at least most of the time, she doesn&#8217;t stay virginal throughout the book. That trope has an expiration date, if you will. This next one is actually significantly more irritating to me &#8211; partly, admittedly, because it&#8217;s outside my experience in a way that I have no particular interest in remedying, but mainly because even if I didn&#8217;t feel that way I still think I&#8217;d find the topic clumsily handled and often just shoehorned in to make the romance more&#8230;legitimate.</p>

Image by the illustrious Kate Beaton (http://www.harkavagrant.com), shirt by topatoco.</p></div>
<p>That&#8217;s right, folks: I&#8217;m talking about babies. Well, in brief. I suppose more accurately (and more vaguely) what I&#8217;m talking about is parenthood.</p>
<p>I suppose putting this column in second is kind of cheating, because it jumps to the end of the standard romance novel narrative &#8211; or, depending on how much edginess we&#8217;re going for, about three-quarters of the way through &#8211; and for that I apologise, but I promise you that the baby trope is all-pervasive enough that it&#8217;s not going  to matter. An Extremely Standard Romance Novel, you see, goes something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>[Play]boy meets [virgin] girl</li>
<li>They deny their attraction to one another for a while (usually this consists of Mr Man insisting that our heroine is Just Like All Other Women and although she makes his dick hard he could never actually love her, and our heroine protesting any kind of attraction to Mr Man at all)</li>
<li>Inevitably, sex.</li>
<li>A brief honeymoon period, usually compounded by more sex</li>
<li>Some kind of big misunderstanding that breaks them apart [at this point the heroine may or may not discover that she is pregnant]</li>
<li>Reunion. Marriage. BABIES.</li>
</ol>
<p>The story outlined above is common to a lot of romance novels (including our old friend from last time, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Bought-Destitute-Yet-Defiant-ebook/dp/B004NBZGGK/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1345324117&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank"><strong>Bought: Destitute Yet Defiant</strong></a>) but it is by no means the only sprog-imbued narrative out there in Romancelandia. Nor is it even the most baby-heavy. A quick search on <a href="http://dearauthor.com/" target="_blank">Dear Author</a> for &#8220;babies&#8221; turned up eight pages of hits and reminded me that Dear Author actually <a href="http://dearauthor.com/tag/secret-baby/" target="_blank">has a tag</a> for &#8220;secret baby&#8221; plotlines &#8211; yes, they exist, and they&#8217;re common enough that they get their own category on review sites. These stories might start out with two separated lovers meeting again after many years &#8211; but wait! She has a child! The fact that it&#8217;s <em>his</em> child is blindingly obvious throughout, but often only revealed at the very end! What could be more romantic?</p>
<p>A nicely infuriating example of this trope on my Kindle is a little tale called <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Emergency-Wife-Lost-Found-ebook/dp/B004NBZGFQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1348656852&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank"><strong>Emergency: Wife Lost and Found</strong></a> &#8211; a Mills&amp;Boon Medical Romance by Carol Marinelli that, to be fair, I have to admit was less awful upon revisitation than I remember it being the first time around. It&#8217;s a reunion tale between two doctors who met in medical school and married young because &#8211; shockingly &#8211; they got pregnant, but whose marriage then fell apart upon the loss of the baby.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Emergency-Wife-Lost-Found.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="12472" data-permalink="/2012/09/26/hopeless-reimantic-2-that-thing-that-comes-after-love-and-marriage/emergency-wife-lost-found/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Emergency-Wife-Lost-Found.jpg?fit=316%2C504&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="316,504" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Emergency-Wife-Lost-Found" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Emergency-Wife-Lost-Found.jpg?fit=188%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Emergency-Wife-Lost-Found.jpg?fit=316%2C504&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Emergency-Wife-Lost-Found-188x300.jpg?resize=188%2C300" alt="" title="Emergency-Wife-Lost-Found" width="188" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-12472" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Emergency-Wife-Lost-Found.jpg?w=188&amp;ssl=1 188w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Emergency-Wife-Lost-Found.jpg?w=316&amp;ssl=1 316w" sizes="(max-width: 188px) 100vw, 188px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>This is not, to be clear, in itself a storyline I take issue with. The loss of a child is a devastating one, and especially to a couple who married essentially because of the child (there are some token protests that it would have happened anyway because they were in Real True Love, but still) &#8211; I can only imagine the effects of that on their relationship. It&#8217;s no wonder they divorced, and believeable that their meeting again after so long would be fraught with emotional tension (and I don&#8217;t wanna go into the whole thing, but there&#8217;s a lot of emotional tension for their meeting to be fraught with). And it&#8217;s understandable that some of the tension between them also comes from Lorna, the heroine, having since discovered that due to <a href="http://www.endometriosis-uk.org/" target="_blank">endometriosis</a> she&#8217;s unlikely to carry another pregnancy to term. I would actually have been extremely interested in a book that <em>had</em> dealt with those issues &#8211; that explored the characters coming to term with Lorna&#8217;s infertility, and how that might have changed or strengthened their relationship.</p>
<p>The thing is, the book doesn&#8217;t actually deal with any of those issues. It skates over them briefly, and then True Love Sex happens, and Lorna&#8230;gets pregnant. Magically. And by the book&#8217;s epilogue, she has another child on the way, and her happiness is complete. See, true love fixed her!</p>
<p>Secret babies and miracle pregnancies are not limited to contemporary romance fiction, either, although it&#8217;s only here that the total absence (or extremely brief, give-it-one-sentence-and-handwave-it-away mentions of) abortion, adoption (either way!) and foster care are so totally and thoroughly angering. Historicals often feature a heroine whose dark secret is that, for whatever reason, she thinks she can&#8217;t have children but then, inexplicably, has at least one child by the end of the book; the widow whose husband never gave her children, but who then meets the hero and gets pregnant so fast you&#8217;d think they had some sort of corresponding velcro arrangement, is a particularly common one. Because that is the miracle that true love can provide.</p>
<p>True love also, incidentally, provides the incentive for wanting the kids in the first place in roughly half of these cases &#8211; there are quite a lot of cases of heroines (and heroes, to be fair) for whom a family was always endgame, but also a depressing number of heroines who get pregnant, having never wanted or thought about children before, and are midway through a totally justified freakout when they realise that the baby must be Mr Man&#8217;s and melt into a puddle of warm, maternal goo and aren&#8217;t scared anymore. And don&#8217;t get me started on the reaction some heroes have to this. I distinctly remember a book I read a few months ago &#8211; it was called <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Momentary-Marriage-ebook/dp/B008OJ8AEC/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1348657105&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank"><strong>Momentary Marriage</strong></a>, one of those &#8220;we&#8217;ll just marry for a year or so to help us both out of a jam that could totally not be solved any other way!&#8221; storylines &#8211; and the hero of our tale not only makes plans to impregnate the heroine without her knowledge so that she&#8217;ll stay with him, but spends about half a page getting turned on at the idea. If art does imitate life, there are a lot more pregnancy fetishists out there than you&#8217;d expect. All I&#8217;m sayin&#8217;.</p>
<p>The thing is, while this trope may be extremely common in romance novels &#8211; overwhelmingly, nauseatingly common, even &#8211; it isn&#8217;t confined to them. Remember <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_of_the_Daleks" target="_blank"><strong>Asylum of the Daleks</strong></a>, the first episode of the new season of <strong>Doctor Who</strong>? That one that came out a few weeks ago? Remember Rory and Amy&#8217;s Fifty Seconds Of Conflict, when he shouts at her for leaving him and her response is WELL YOU WANTED CHILDREN AND I CAN&#8217;T HAVE THEM, SO I GAVE YOU UP RATHER THAN ACTUALLY TRY TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS? Yeah. Because in the UK in 2012, apparently adoption doesn&#8217;t exist, and neither does speaking to your partner. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Town_Called_Mercy" target="_blank">Later on</a> in the series we have Mad Scientist Alien, who looks at Amy and can immediately tell that she&#8217;s had children because she is sad and fierce and caring, as if motherhood is the only experience that could confer these characteristics. Genre-hopping a bit to <strong>Game of Thrones</strong>, we have Daenerys Targaryen, who becomes a mother to her people because she&#8217;s never going to have children who aren&#8217;t dragons. (Which I personally don&#8217;t see the problem with. I would <em>much</em> rather have dragon-babies than baby-babies, although I suppose feeding them would be something of a negotiation.) And these are just the examples I can think of off the top of my head.</p>
<p>I appreciate that a lot of people do want children. I appreciate that some would even go so far as to say that their children are the best things in their lives, and that is valid and legitimate and completely worthy of representation in fiction. In spite of all that, though,  as you may be able to tell, I have extremely little patience with this trope, and I&#8217;m going to try and explain why without sputtering too incoherently. Bear with me a moment.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>First of all, I have a huge problem with motherhood being portrayed as the only really worthwhile thing a woman can aspire to. Motherhood is worthwhile, and it is important, and it deserves to be venerated and respected. But I object to the idea that it is the <em>only</em> thing that is worthwhile and important and worthy of veneration and respect. This elevation to the exclusion of all other things is not, as I&#8217;m not the first person to point out, extended to fatherhood, either &#8211; a man who never has children may well have been doing other, equally important, things, whereas a woman who&#8217;s never had children is often seen as an object of either pity or scorn. </p>
<p>So far, it seems that the only wish-fulfilment medium aimed specifically at women overwhelmingly portrays babies as the reward a good woman gets for being a good person and a good lover and without which no other goodness is really, truly good. Where does that leave women who have real-life style infertility &#8211; the kind that isn&#8217;t fixed by falling in lasting love &#8211; or those who just never had that wish in the first place?</p>
<p>And that brings me to my next point. I&#8217;d like everyone to bear in mind, by the way, that I say this next part as a person who doesn&#8217;t actually <em>like</em> children that much. I&#8217;ve definitely mellowed towards them as I&#8217;ve grown older &#8211; meeting some actually nice ones that I wasn&#8217;t forced to hang out with because I was presenting female at the time has helped &#8211; but I&#8217;m not a particular fan. They&#8217;re okay; I might want my own someday, but right now I&#8217;m leaning towards not. (That&#8217;s right, Friend Of My Friend&#8217;s Family Who Wrote Me That Poem About How Not Having Kids Is A Waste Of My Genes Five Years Ago<sup><a href="/2012/09/26/hopeless-reimantic-2-that-thing-that-comes-after-love-and-marriage/#footnote_0_12444" id="identifier_0_12444" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" True freaking story. ">1</a></sup> &#8211; the answer&#8217;s still no.)</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s review, shall we? So far this segment we&#8217;ve talked about pregnancy, secret pregnancy, miracle pregnancy, infertility, abortion, adoption and the concept of motherhood.</p>
<p>What have we not &#8211; really &#8211; talked about?</p>
<p>Any actual babies.</p>
<p>I do understand that it can be difficult to write about the children in child-plotlines themselves, especially if the story in question is actually supposed to be focused on relationships between adults. But there&#8217;s a pretty big difference between &#8220;this character is important but doesn&#8217;t really do much beyond eat and cry and poop, so I can&#8217;t write too much about them&#8221; and &#8220;we need something important in this story! What&#8217;s important to women? BABIES! Let&#8217;s put some babies in here&#8221;. </p>
<p>I suppose my overwhelming thought is that if it&#8217;s so difficult to write about pregnancies or children in a well-rounded way that makes them more than plot devices (or Plot Moppets, as the good folk over at Smart Bitches refer to them) writers should maybe think more carefully about including a pregnancy storyline, and how to treat it if they do decide to put one in (as, er, it were). Babies are the tiny humans that shape the future of our world. They deserve more respect than that.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it for today! Next time on Hopeless Reimantic&#8230;either marriage or playboy heroes, I haven&#8217;t decided yet.</p>
<p>See you then!</p>

<blockquote><p>
“You were a virgin, Jess.”</p>
<p>“Yes.” This time she didn&#8217;t deny it. “And the reason I was still a virgin was because you&#8217;re the only man I&#8217;ve ever wanted. I was never interested in anyone else. Even when I thought I hated you, I still didn&#8217;t want anyone else.”</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>Bought: Destitute Yet Defiant</strong>, Sarah Morgan (Harlequin Mills &amp; Boon Ltd, 2010)</p></blockquote>
<p>I pretty much picked that first reference at random. <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Bought-Destitute-Yet-Defiant-ebook/dp/B004NBZGGK/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1345324117&#038;sr=1-1"><strong>Bought</strong></a> was the first Mills &amp; Boon I ever actually purchased (I say purchased; at the time of writing it was still a free download on Amazon) and it was absolutely everything I thought a contemporary romance would be, so it holds a special, slightly nauseated place in my heart. It was a lucky choice, though, because a great deal of what I want to say about this trope is contained in this book.</p>

I promise it’s cheesy in a whole different way than it looks.</p></div> The virginal heroine trope is one that holds a great deal of interest for me. <strong>Bought</strong> is a pretty straightforward example of it – the heroine is a virgin who has never had eyes for anybody but the hero (and she&#8217;s twenty-two when the story takes place, taking this out of the believable realm of the adolescent crush), so not only is a sexual relationship with him her first experience of sex, it&#8217;s her first experience of emotional intimacy as well – <em>and</em> there&#8217;s no mention throughout the book of her having any other friends, so her connection to him is pretty much her only in this world. Not even <strong>Fifty Shades of Grey</strong>, with its asexual-at-the-start heroine, sets the trope up so perfectly. (Yes, I have read the <strong>Fifty Shades</strong> trilogy. No, I&#8217;m not ready to talk about it yet.)</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot of – entirely justifiable – outrage over how prevalent the virgin heroine is, even today. I am <em>not</em> going to go into the whole problematic mess that is the idea that a woman&#8217;s ability to love truly and purely is somehow connected to her physical “purity”, or the idea that a woman can only give herself fully to a lover – as if that&#8217;s a healthy focal point for a relationship anyway – if she&#8217;s unclaimed territory when the book begins, so to speak. (You would not believe how many romances I&#8217;ve beat myself over the head with in which the hero cries “I can&#8217;t take this anymore! I don&#8217;t care if you were a dirty slutty hobag before we fell in love! I love you anyway! &#8230;wait, you were a <em>virgin</em>? OH THANK GOD YOU BELONG ONLY TO ME NOW”.)</p>

<p>Nor am I going to touch on the huge double standard that is the the common pairing of the virginal heroine with the Virile Manly Man, who has explored delightful bedroom adventures with many a lady fair – but still takes the heroine&#8217;s virginity as proof that she&#8217;s someone special. (But of course has nevertheless been totally respectful of all of his previous partners. <em>Of course.</em>) I may write about them sometime, but this is an overview with a word limit, so I&#8217;ll put some further reading links at the bottom of the post and we can call it even for now.</p>
<p>She spans all genres, does the virginal heroine (insert your own pun here. Yes, I said insert. No, I didn&#8217;t mean – look, just go and sit in the corner, okay?), and some are easier to deal with than others. The historical probably has the most easily explicable virgin heroine of all; it&#8217;s history! We know what women were like in history! Virgins were the most highly prized of all the ladies, weren&#8217;t they? Non-virgins were cast out and shunned and other antisocial-type punishments as well, and they would never marry, so any heroine worth her salt is going to <em>have</em> to be a virgin, or she&#8217;s not going to be good enough for the hero. Duh. It&#8217;s historical accuracy! Everybody&#8217;s actions always correspond perfectly with prevalent attitudes of the time, didn&#8217;t you know that? The paranormal and fantasy genres get away with it pretty easily as well, often with some kind of mystical bond that predestines the two central characters for one another – although that doesn&#8217;t necessarily preclude one of the characters having had sexual relations beforehand. Sound like a contradiction? I don&#8217;t think it is – more on that in a moment.</p>
<p>Which brings me neatly to the virgin heroine who gives me the most trouble; the contemporary one. This lady can be anyone, you guys. She&#8217;s a businesswoman or a hairdresser or a secretary or a recluse. She&#8217;s shy, or she&#8217;s loud and brash. But she always has this part of her that is&#8230;untouched, as it were, and I&#8217;ve seen authors who will write themselves around some pretty amazing corners to keep that so. She&#8217;s never found the right guy. She&#8217;s never experienced sexual desire before, or if she has it&#8217;s been fleeting or fumbling enough to ignore – this is <em>overwhelmingly common</em>. Which brings me back to <strong>Bought</strong>, with its heroine who waited through an entire book for a hero she was never even really sure she wanted, because the true and deep love she felt for him superceded all other possible emotional connections.</p>
<p>In some ways, it&#8217;s not just the heroine who gets this. A discussion on <a href="http://www.iheartpresents.com/">I (Heart) Presents</a> brought me this, from an interview with romance author Julia James:</p>
<blockquote><p>I must say, I’ve done this several times, when the hero, realising the heroine is a virgin, goes to great lengths to ensure her first experience is really special, and, of course, in doing so, makes it really special for himself as well. In a way, she gives him her physical virginity, and in exchange he gives her his emotional virginity.<br />
<a href="http://www.iheartpresents.com/2007/06/recap-virgin-heroines-in-harlequin-presents-books/"> [Source]</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Smart Bitches, Trashy Books has its own epithet for the hero&#8217;s “emotional virginity”; they call it his coming into contact with the Magic Hoo-Hah. (The hero&#8217;s counterpart for this is the Mighty Wang, if anyone was interested.) The principle is pretty much the same; somehow, during sex, the hero and heroine exchange a piece of each other that nobody&#8217;s ever seen or touched before. And, because of the underpinning idea that men are physical creatures where women are emotional ones, that usually translates to the heroine being physically untouched before she meets the hero, and nobody ever having touched His Heart<sup><a href="/2012/08/20/hopeless-reimantic-part-one-virginal-heroines/#footnote_0_11884" id="identifier_0_11884" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" Anybody ever saying this sentence out loud is required by law to finish it up with a single emo tear. ">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In a lot of ways it is this, more than a heroine&#8217;s physical virginity, that worries me about the trope as a whole. Because it&#8217;s been occurring to me more and more often than the virginal heroine does not necessarily need to be a virgin, per se; the second most commonly occurring version of this trope that I&#8217;ve read, usually in contemporaries, is one in which the heroine <em>has</em> had sex. Not, in most cases, often – maybe once or twice, and always with the man she fancied herself in love with before she met the hero. But she didn&#8217;t really enjoy it; it was uncomfortable or even painful, and after that relationship ended she never really thought of doing it again, and she figured she&#8217;d never really understand what about it was so much fun.</p>
<p>Even LGBT romance has its own version of this, in the form of the straight-person-turned-gay (rarely if ever is there a story of a straight person turning bi), who had sex – even lots of sex! &#8211; with the opposite gender, but never really experienced attraction before meeting their same-sex true love. Which is a plausible enough narrative, in fairness, but loses something in that the true love in question tends to be the only person our straight-turned-gay hero/ine experiences any kind of attraction towards at all.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen justifications of this, and I can see why it&#8217;s popular. If romance is fantasy-fodder, what creates a more perfect fantasy than two people exploring new emotional ground together so that you, the reader, can vicariously experience all of that awe-struck joy and wonder? You only fall in love for the first time once, after all, and this creates a world in which the first time you experience this all-consuming emotion is also the only time. You wander into this amazing place, all innocence, and you are thrilled and delighted – and then you never have to leave again. What could be more perfect than that?</p>
<p>Okay, who here has witnessed somebody they&#8217;re close to fall in love for the second (or third or fourth) time? And – and I&#8217;m aware that not everybody does this – who&#8217;s also seen them perform this amazing feat of selective memory, where suddenly their past relationships no longer really “count”? Oh, sure, they&#8217;ll say, we had some good times, it was fun while it lasted, but it was never really all that – I always <em>knew</em> something was missing. And now I&#8217;ve found it, because this – <em>this</em> – is the real thing.</p>
<p>Who&#8217;s seen that repeated over and over again through a cycle of partners?</p>
<p>Because watching that happen? That&#8217;s the kind of feeling this trope gives me. I want to be happy that this kind of &#8220;mine is a love that I&#8217;ve never yet loved&#8221; tabula rasa brings happiness to people, but &#8211; I can&#8217;t. It kind of depresses me, if I&#8217;m honest. I&#8217;m more a believer in there being A One (or more than one One!) than there being The One, but I wasn&#8217;t always, and even when I wasn&#8217;t I&#8217;ve always kind of thought &#8211; so what if somebody&#8217;s not The One? Do they have to be secondhand? Even in Fantasyland, is it so important that every single other relationship a person has before they meet The One be denigrated like this? Even stories about a person loving again after they&#8217;ve lost a partner to death suffer from this kind of &#8220;it was never like this before, this person is touching a part of me that has never been touched&#8221; thing, bar a very rare few.</p>
<p>There are exceptions to this, of course. I&#8217;m desperate to get my hands on <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12769479-a-gentleman-undone"><strong>A Gentleman Undone</strong></a> by Cecilia Grant, which unfortunately is only out in print, but features a courtesan heroine who <em>actually enjoys sex,</em> even before she meets the hero. I recently read a pretty damned excellent book by Molly O&#8217;Keefe called <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13151734-can-t-buy-me-love"><strong>Can&#8217;t Buy Me Love</strong></a>, whose hero and heroine are many things, but untouched ain&#8217;t one. In LGBT-ish fiction, and incidentally also one of the &#8220;very rare few&#8221; widower-whose-previous-relationship-meant-quite-a-bloody-lot books, Deirdre Knight&#8217;s <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6411238-butterfly-tattoo"><strong>Butterfly Tattoo</strong></a> has two people loving again without discounting their prior experience. And the hero&#8217;s bisexual. Right on.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s Virginal (Emotionally and Physically) Heroines (with the occasional Hero). Next up, I&#8230;haven&#8217;t actually decided what I&#8217;m covering yet! Enjoy the mystery.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello. My name is Rei, and I read romance novels.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello. My name is Rei, and I read romance novels.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been weirdly obsessed with romance novels for about the past two years. I read my first one a lot longer ago than that – I abducted and read, over a period of about three weeks, a romance with a name I can&#8217;t remember about a Japanese lady falling in love with an American man just after World War II during my breaks in volunteering at a nursing home – but I didn&#8217;t really think all that much about them for a while afterwards. Then I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.smartbitchestrashybooks.com">Smart Bitches, Trashy Books</a> and started following it because, damn, those ladies are hilarious, and from there started following <a href="http://dearauthor.com">Dear Author</a> as well, who focus on snark a little less (although they can also be pretty funny) but who are nevertheless thoughtful and insightful in their reviews. For a long time, I was an avid follower of the romance industry without ever actually having picked up more than two romances.</p>
<p>And then I got a Kindle for Christmas.</p>
<p>You guys, for the reluctant obsessive, ebook readers are poison in super-convenient button-clicky packaging. Thanks to its extreme user-friendliness and the large number of freebooks available on the Amazon website (in case anybody is worried that I&#8217;m being paid for advertising, the wireless keeps breaking and sometimes the thing refuses to charge) I have something like one hundred romance novels on my Kindle now – a conservative estimate, not taking into account non-category romances and books debatably qualified for the title. I can&#8217;t stop reading them, and I can&#8217;t stop talking about them; I am fascinated by romance novels, in spite of the fact that more often than not picking one up guarantees that I will spend half the book with my jaw clenched to the point of pain. It&#8217;s a guilty pleasure, if by “pleasure” you mean “bafflement-inducing” and “guilty” you mean “thing that I am liable to be judged for”.</p>

Well, I&#8217;ve been a reader ever since I was a kid – I&#8217;ve tried pretty much every genre of fiction, from fantasy to crime to sci-fi to sci-fi fantasy crime – and category romance is, without question, the most formulaic genre I have ever come across. It&#8217;s baffling. I mean, every genre has its stock characters and tropes, but while there are things that crop up a lot in, say, fantasy, as far as I can see the only thing really required to write a fantasy novel is the strong enough conviction that what you&#8217;re writing is fantasy. Write a category romance, and your story is pretty much plotted out for you. Don&#8217;t believe me? Let&#8217;s take a look at the submission guidelines for <a href="http://uat2.millsandboon.co.uk/AAModernR.asp">Mills and Boon Modern Romance</a> (the UK version of Harlequin Presents):</p>
<blockquote><p>Readers are whisked away to exclusive jet-set locations&#8230;When the hero strides into the story he&#8217;s a powerful, ruthless man who knows exactly what &#8211; and who &#8211; he wants and he isn&#8217;t used to taking no for an answer! Yet he has depth and integrity, and he will do anything to make the heroine his. Though she may be shy and vulnerable, she&#8217;s also plucky and determined to challenge his arrogant pursuit.</p>
<p>Modern Romance explores emotional themes that are universal. These should be played out as part of highly-charged conflicts that are underpinned by blistering sexual anticipation and released as passionate lovemaking&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Got that? So, your story has to be somewhere “exclusive and jet-set” (what does “jet-set” actually mean in this context? I sort of expect the entire thing to be set in the Business Class lounge at Stansted) and your hero needs to be a Romance Novel Hero, you know, hot and alpha and, well, willing to be kind of creepy if he thinks it&#8217;ll help. (Bonus points if he&#8217;s so manly that his manliness bursts out of the cover &#8211; for reference, please see the pictured-below edition of <strong>The Very Virile Viking</strong>, one of the most beautifully alliteratively-titled works of romance that I have ever come across.) And your heroine needs to challenge him but also be vulnerable to him. And they need to clash and eventually express that clash through a lot of hot sex.</p>

And this moulding of the romance novel storyline doesn&#8217;t stop with the publishing guidelines; the romance novel review websites I follow do downgrade books that fail to deliver on agreed-upon “romance trademarks”, although in fairness the only one that seems to need strict adherence is that of the HEA (that&#8217;s Happily Ever After, to those of you who use their time much more wisely than I do). Even that strikes me as strange, because while I can understand it as a trend – if, as common theory purports, romance novels are wish fulfilment fantasies, why wouldn&#8217;t they have a happy ending? &#8211; I can&#8217;t wrap my head around it as the thing which makes a romance novel <em>romantic</em>. More on that later.</p>
<p>Which brings me, finally, to this: Why do I think it useful to subject romance novels to feminist analysis? Aren&#8217;t they just, as a friend of mine once put it, “granny porn”? Is there any mileage in analysing such an outdated form of trashy entertainment from a feminist perspective?</p>
<p>I obviously think so, or I wouldn&#8217;t be writing this. And here&#8217;s why: <em>most romance novel writers are women, writing for a female audience</em>. I&#8217;ve read some (very good) romance novels written by men geared towards women, but only a very few, and they tend to focus on gay male couplings – in other words, not part of the main body of mainstream romance publishing. (LGBT people in romance novels is a whole &#8216;nother article.) More troubling is that most of the flaws and foibles of romance tropes that persist even today – virginal women, marriage and babies or nothing, and the time-honoured classic of “forced seduction” &#8211; are overwhelmingly shrugged off as “it&#8217;s just wish fulfilment”.</p>
<p>Is it?</p>
<p>As a lifelong avid reader, I&#8217;m no stranger to escaping into a good book. And I have no doubt that there are people out there who don&#8217;t really want a relationship in which the man takes charge, sweeps the lady off her feet, and loves her with a love that&#8217;s never been loved before until her resolve melts into baby-making funtimes, but can still get into a traditional romance plotline just for kicks. But is this still (or has it ever been) so overpoweringly The Female Fantasy that it&#8217;s the go-to, the default, the only world a romance fan wants to escape into? Why are these elements so built into “women&#8217;s” fiction? And what, in the end, does that tell us about the cultural narrative that has been built around us?</p>
<p>Those are the questions I want to answer; they&#8217;re the main thing going around in my head every time I pick up a new romance, and they are what keeps me reading whenever I finish one that has made me want to drill a hole through my skull. (Which isn&#8217;t all of them! Some are quite good. Maybe someday I&#8217;ll tell you about them.)</p>
<p>To get us started, though, over the next few weeks I&#8217;ll be doing a rundown of what I think are the five most central tropes or stock characters in romance novels. It&#8217;s going to be difficult to whittle the list down that far, but I&#8217;ll power through it. Honest. I don&#8217;t really need this university education.</p>
<p>Over the course of the series, I&#8217;ll look at the trope itself, where, when and how it shows up in different genres, and how I think it&#8217;s been adapted for the modern romance novel, because if there&#8217;s another thing that seems to be true of romance? It&#8217;s that they never throw anything away. I&#8230;am no one to judge on that, as anybody who&#8217;s seen my living space will be able to attest, but there&#8217;s an impressive level of trope-hoarding that goes on around here, and I&#8217;m going to show you why. I&#8217;ll also be probing a bit into what that means for romance storylines as a whole.</p>
<p>So stay tuned for Instalment One, which is going to be the aforementioned Virginal Heroine! Are you excited? I&#8217;m excited.</p>
<p>See you then!</p>
