										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Inspired by those plucky Pussy Riot gals and their &#8216;being sent to a penal colony for a peaceful protest&#8217; hi-jinks in Russia last year, I set out to find tracks from riot grrrl bands around the world. And just to shift the focus for once, I&#8217;ve ignored the US, Canada, Australia, Japan, Europe and other super wealthy places.</p>
<p>&#8216;Are there grrrls in the majority world?&#8217; I wondered. The answer is yes, and they rock. In fact I&#8217;ve made a <a title="Majority World Riot Grrrl Playlist" href="http://bit.ly/majoritygrrrl" target="_blank"><strong>Majority World Riot Grrrl playlist</strong></a> which can be found for your delectation. Big shout out to <a title="Riot Grrrl Berlin Compilations" href="http://riotgrrrlberlin.tumblr.com/grrrlcompilations" target="_blank">Riot Grrrl Berlin</a> and their fantastic compilations, on which lots of these bands feature.</p>
<h2><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/tank-girl.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="13254" data-permalink="/2013/03/08/majority-world-riot-grrrl/tank-girl/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/tank-girl.jpg?fit=454%2C381&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="454,381" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Tank Girl Nepal Promo Pic" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/tank-girl.jpg?fit=300%2C252&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/tank-girl.jpg?fit=454%2C381&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignleft  wp-image-13254" alt="Tank Girl Nepal Promo Pic" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/tank-girl.jpg?resize=327%2C275" width="327" height="275" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Nepal</h2>
<p>The first band I found was an anarchafeminist outfit from Nepal called <a title="Tank Girl" href="http://kasamaproject.org/2010/04/14/tank-girl-anarcha-feminist-punk-from-nepal/" target="_blank"><strong>Tank Girl</strong></a>. Nepal has a deeply traditional patriarchal society; marital rape was outlawed only in 2006 and still carries just a six month sentence. Rape survivors are often ostracised, having &#8216;brought shame&#8217; to their family and wider community. Dalit (or &#8216;low-caste&#8217;) women face additional discrimination and extremely high levels of violence.</p>
<p>One of Tank Girl&#8217;s members, Sareena Rai, is involved in two other feminist DIY punk bands, <a title="Rai Ko Ris" href="http://diypunknepal.blogspot.com.au/2011/06/short-interview-with-rai-ko-ris.html " target="_blank">Rai Ko Ris</a> and <a title="Nepal" href="ttp://subcultatlas.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/nepal-stories-from-nepal.html " target="_blank">Naya Faya</a>, and works to help Dalit women to protect themselves from gender-based violence, delivering self-defence training in her house. Which is pretty awesome.</p>
<h2>Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia</h2>
<p>I found a few more Asia-Pacific riot grrrl bands, including the adorable <a title="Youtube - Fatal Posporos" href="http://youtu.be/exu28Xt3Trs" target="_blank"><strong>Fatal Posporos</strong></a> from the Philippines and <a title="Myspace - Pretty Riot" href="http://www.myspace.com/prettyriot09 " target="_blank"><strong>Pretty Riot</strong></a> from Indonesia. As well as bands <a title="Hellsister" href="http://ohmytracks.com/#/music/Hellsister" target="_blank"><strong>Hellsister</strong></a> and <a title="Myspace - Dance On Your Grave" href="http://www.myspace.com/doygmusic" target="_blank"><strong>Dance On Your Grave</strong></a>, the scene in Malaysia was (and hopefully still is) large enough to support a zine distro called <a title="Grrrl:Rebel" href="http://grrrlzines.net/interviews/grrrlrebel.htm" target="_blank"><strong>Grrrl:Rebel</strong></a>. “Through zines, people in the scene are much more exposed to stuffs that were somewhat limited to them and the public before” founder Carol told <a title="Grrrzines" href="http://grrrlzines.net/" target="_blank">GrrrlZines.net</a> in 2001. “In countries like Malaysia and Singapore, you would get arrested if you write any articles that can be considered as threats to the government.”</p>
<p>It&#8217;s comments like that which I find so remarkable, dropped into interviews about the role of girls in the punk scene and the best local bands which could kind of be about anywhere.</p>
<h2>Africa and the Middle East</h2>
<p>While I couldn&#8217;t find any trace of a riot grrrl scene in Africa, I did happen upon a 2011 documentary called <a title="Afropop - Punk In Africa" href="http://www.afropop.org/wp/6866/punk-in-africa/" target="_blank"><strong>Punk In Africa</strong></a> which sounds good. And in the Middle East, grrrls are thin on the ground, but judging from the cracking <a title="MidEast Tunes" href="http://mideastunes.com/" target="_blank">MidEastTunes</a> website there are plenty of women active in dark metal and goth, including Bahrain&#8217;s first all-girl metal band <a title="LA Times - Scarlet Tear" href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/babylonbeyond/2010/08/bahrain-.html" target="_blank"><strong>Scarlet Tear</strong></a>.</p>
<h2>Mexico, Venezuela and Brazil</h2>
<p>South America does seem to have a sizeable riot grrrl base &#8211; my cursory search turned up bands in Mexico, Venezuela, Chile, Colombia and Argentina. <a title="Myspace - Le Butcherettes" href="http://www.myspace.com/lebutcherettes " target="_blank"><strong>Le Butcherettes</strong></a> from Mexico are definitely worth a listen, and I&#8217;d like to find more by a Venezuelan skapunk outfit called <a title="Pure Volume - 7 Potencias" href="http://www.purevolume.com/7potencias" target="_blank"><strong>7 Potencias</strong></a> who have a song called &#8216;Feminista de Bolsillo&#8217;, which I&#8217;m led to believe translates as &#8216;Pocket Feminist&#8217;.</p>
<p>The biggest scene seems to be in Brazil, which boasts a huge list of bands and artists, including <a title="Myspace - Dominatrix" href="http://www.myspace.com/contatodominatrix" target="_blank"><strong>Dominatrix</strong></a>, <a title="Bandcamp - Siete Armas" href="http://sietearmas.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Siete Armas</strong></a> and <a title="Myspace - Bertha Lutz" href="http://www.myspace.com/bandaberthalutz" target="_blank"><strong>Bertha Lutz</strong></a>, with her irresistibly-titled track &#8216;Feminism? Yes Please!&#8217;.</p>
<p>Bit of context: while Brazil is the world&#8217;s sixth largest economy, there is still vast inequality. And although it currently has a female President for the first time in Dilma Rouseff, women make up just 8.6% of the seats in Parliament. Abortion is legal only to save a woman&#8217;s life or in cases of rape, and in 2010, it was <a title="Wikigender - Brazil" href="http://www.wikigender.org/index.php/Gender_Equality_in_Brazil" target="_blank">reported</a> that 200,000 women a year are hospitalized for complications of illegal abortion.</p>
<p>The reasons behind riot grrrl&#8217;s popularity in Brazil are even the subject of an <a title="Journals" href="http://journals.lib.washington.edu/index.php/intersections/article/view/9544" target="_blank">academic paper by Calla Hummel</a>, who recognises the political significance and adaptability of this particular bit of shouty youth culture:</p>
<blockquote><p>Brazilian riot grrrl is one of the sites where Western cultural hegemony is being called into question&#8230; As it moves across borders, riot grrrl becomes a form of transnational feminism – and grrrls must address how ideas and material originating in a given locale may resonate, change, or delegitimize ideas and work in another.</p></blockquote>
<p>Gender inequality is a global problem which varies in its expression across different cultural contexts. It&#8217;s not an &#8216;over there&#8217; issue, but in some places it&#8217;s more severe than in others. Similarly, riot grrrl anywhere is awesome, but the courage and kickassness of the grrrls in these bands is pretty inspiring.</p>
<p>As a band member called Isabella quoted by Hummel says:</p>
<blockquote><p>As long as we keep getting letters from the middle of the jungle, from a tiny, three person town in the Amazon, from some girl saying, &#8216;Feminism saved my life, thank you,&#8217; we will keep doing it.</p></blockquote>

					<description><![CDATA[How do you put on a DIY feminist club night? Girl Germs show us how it's done!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li><em>Yet another guest post! We asked Lydia and Laura, the brains behind London feminist club night <strong>Girl Germs</strong>, to give us some tips about how it&#8217;s done. Do you have a guest post brewing in your brain? You know the drill: email us on <a href="mailto:badrepeditors@gmail.com"><strong>badrepeditors@gmail.com</strong></a></em>.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/girlgermslondon" target="_blank"><strong>Girl Germs</strong></a> is our DIY feminist, queer and trans* friendly club night, and soon-to-be record label. We started in 2008, as part of our university’s Feminist Week. We hired out the student union bar, and suddenly we had four bands booked. We had a lot of help from the staff at the union, and our friends in the Feminist Society blew up loads of balloons for us. And on the night, people turned up! To a club night that we arranged!</p>
<p>When we graduated, we decided that we wanted to do it again. We were a bit cautious, though, as suddenly we were dealing with real venues and it was just the two of us (and our friend Tukru, with her <a href="http://www.vampiresushi.co.uk/" target="_blank">amazing zine distro</a>). We put on several nights in Camden with no bands where we’d DJ for hours, sometimes getting our friends to help us out when we got tired. Our little venue was always full, and everybody left tired and sweaty.</p>

<p>But it was during the preparations for <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/12/02/five-things-i-found-at-ladyfest-ten/">Ladyfest Ten</a> that we plucked up the courage to put on another full-scale night with bands. We managed to put on three of our favourite bands and organise DJs, stalls and even cake. We’d somehow pulled it off again! The place was packed, and we were exhausted, but ecstatic.</p>
<p>The plan was to build on the success of that night, but mental health issues and a period of unemployment and geographical separation meant it was impossible. We’re back next month though, and more excited than ever.</p>
<p>We’ve learned a lot through running Girl Germs. But the biggest thing is: running a club night is easy. Most promoters don’t want you to know that, because they don’t want you to try it yourself. We’re poor, unsociable and uncool. We spend a lot of time talking to our cat. If we can do it, so can you.</p>
<h2>You don’t need a lot of money</h2>
<p>We both work really hard in low-paid jobs. We don’t have trust funds, or any disposable income to speak of at all, really. A night can be as expensive or cheap as you make it. There are very few upfront costs, because bands and venues can be paid on the night from your door takings. It’s also kind of a waste to spend loads of money on fancy flyers, because the most effective promotion now happens online through social media. We spend a little money on photocopying beforehand, but that’s about it.</p>
<h2>You don’t need ‘connections’</h2>
<p>To have connections, you’d probably need to network, and who wants to do that? We don’t have a little black book with useful emails in. We just write to bands we like and venues we think might want us, and ask nicely. It’s much easer that way, especially if you’re shy. Hell, we barely have the courage to speak to bands when they’re at Girl Germs ready to play.</p>
<h2>You don’t need technical knowledge</h2>
<p>DJing is easy, and the best way to learn is by doing. We learned on the job, and it never went that badly wrong. As well as that, bands will let you know what they need, and venues will understand their requests. Your job is to be the go-between. If you have any questions, bands and sound people are always happy to answer. That’s their job, after all. Generally venues will have most of the gear, and bands expect to bring extras themselves and sometimes share with other acts on the bill.</p>
<h2>You don’t need to spend oodles of time on it</h2>
<p>You won’t need to give up your day job to give yourself enough time to do this. We have very little free time in the evenings after work, but it’s enough to get things done.</p>
<p>In the lead-up, you’ll mainly be emailing people and drumming up support on Twitter and Facebook. If you have a smartphone, you can do this on the go (or under your desk at work). You might need an evening to write a press release, or an hour or so to set up a Facebook page and event, but it’s all manageable if you’re a little bit organised about it.</p>
<h2>You won’t need to beg venues and bands to give you a chance</h2>
<p>Venues need cub nights, and bands need gigs. People need somewhere to go for a dance on a Saturday night. These people aren’t doing you a favour, and most of them won’t act like they are. Venues have always been helpful and supportive to us, and bands have been excited to play. As long as you let people know what they’re doing and when, you’ll be fine.</p>
<p>So, there it is. Easy, huh?</p>
<p>We’d love more club nights to go to, run by like-minded people. Find your own theme, and give it a go. There’s almost nothing more satisfying than watching a room full of people dancing and knowing that you got them there.</p>
<p>If you want to know anything in more detail, or you have questions, you can email us at <a href="mailto:girlgermsondon@gmail.com"><strong>girlgermsondon@gmail.com</strong></a> and we’ll do our best to help.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the past year, a lot of my spare time has been spent researching and writing on women in post-punk for Julia Downes&#8217; new history of the girl band, <a href="http://www.foyles.co.uk/Public/Shop/Detail.aspx?itemId=22095722"><strong>Women Make Noise</strong></a>. </p>
<p>A surprisingly difficult part of this was establishing what we talk about when we talk about post-punk. Roughly, the term refers to the wave of musical experimentation which took place in the wake of punk from the late 1970s to the mid-1980s. It was informed conceptually by the art-school background and grounding in political and cultural theory of many of its members, and distinguished by musical, vocal and lyrical experimentation and by a frequently self-conscious and self-critical approach to the idea of being in a band and making music. All of which meant that it sounded, to varying degrees, original, arresting, and odd.</p>
<p>Post-punk’s disorderly, subversive and category-resistant nature has seen it marginalised in accounts of its era, although the past few years have produced a handful of <a href="http://ripitupinfohype.blogspot.co.uk/2007/08/info-on-rip-it-up-and-start-again.html">useful retrospectives</a>, as well as the early-2000s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-punk_revival">revival</a> of post-punk musical techniques which, if you still can’t explain what it is, at least make it easier to explain what it sounds like.</p>
<p>For me, a large part of the significance of post-punk was that it seemed to involve an unprecedented amount of women as artists, fans, and critics. Its musical, political and aesthetic influence can be traced in many subsequent female-friendly movements, including twee, riot grrrl, grunge and electro. Some post-punk women – <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/03/06/rhian-jones-cover-girls-and-typical-girls/" target="_blank">the Slits</a>, <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/09/29/subtle-subversion-how-i-learned-to-love-the-raincoats-a-bit/" target="_blank">the Raincoats</a>, Lydia Lunch – have made a more enduring dent in popular consciousness than others, and some of them are more ‘hmm, interesting’ than ‘fuck yeah, hidden early-80s gem’, but all the artists featured below are worth a spin.</p>
<p>Extending the gains of punk’s emphasis on DIY culture, accessibility and amateurism, post-punk women were able to take their bands in experimental directions, producing lyrics which explored the female experience in startlingly innovative ways, and music which itself took on what Slits bassist Tessa Pollitt described, when I interviewed her for the book, as a ‘new, raw, and female’ form, a self-consciously radical sound dealing with rarely-expressed emotions like embarrassment, awkwardness and anxiety.</p>
<p>In terms of subject matter, post-punk’s ideological concern with the politicisation of the personal, and with identifying and promoting authenticity in the face of popular cultural stereotypes, lent itself to exploration from a feminine and feminist angle. This concern with authenticity was expressed in the songs themselves, which were produced, structured and presented in a way which set them apart from the glossy manufactured products of mainstream artists. It was expressed too in lyrics which demystified and deconstructed conventional femininity, love, sex and romance, and which analysed social and cultural pressures on women or the tensions of personal relationships in implicitly political ways.</p>
<p>There is far more to post-punk, and many more women within it, than I have space for here. <a href="http://musicophilia.wordpress.com/2009/01/27/women-of-post-punk-the-young-ladys-post-punk-handbook-volume-1-1978-1983/"><strong>The Young Lady’s Post-Punk Handbook</strong></a> provides a good starting-point to other women and bands in the movement, but here are ten from me to kick off:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>1. ESG</strong></p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='420' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/iaxTHyY58og?version=3&#038;rel=0&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe>
<p>ESG, from South Bronx, based their pioneering sound on a love of James Brown, Motown and disco. Spotted at a talent contest, they began to play New York’s cutting-edge clubs, where their sound dovetailed neatly, if unexpectedly, with that of the No Wave scene, and went on to share billing with PiL, Gang of Four and A Certain Ratio. </p>
<p>ESG’s blend of hip-hop and girl-group lyrical sensibility was <a href="http://www.whosampled.com/sampled/ESG/">sampled incessantly</a> by acts from Miles Davis to Tricky and Public Enemy to Liars – although the lack of royalties received antagonized the band, who addressed the issue with typical panache in the 1993 single ‘Sample Credits Don’t Pay Our Bills’.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>2. Raincoats</strong></p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='420' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/MIhrQDIQD2c?version=3&#038;rel=0&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe>
<p>The Raincoats attempted an unsweetened exploration of the social and sexual experience for women, mapping a landscape previously foreign to mainstream rock – a female-centred one of self-consciousness and self-doubt. Their debut’s self-effacing musical communalism has seen it described as the first ‘women’s rock&#8217; album.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>3. Slits</strong></p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='420' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/wrLMm5d6lqg?version=3&#038;rel=0&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe>
<p>From the art-student squats of London’s Ladbroke Grove via Germany, Spain and English suburbia, the Slits made slippery and spacious dub-punk hymns to sex and shoplifting. &#8216;Love und Romance&#8217; burlesques the banality of boy-meets-girl, &#8216;Spend, Spend, Spend’ analyses retail therapy as addiction, and &#8216;Typical Girls&#8217; castigates conventional femininity as a profit-driven invention.</p>
<p>For more on the Slits I&#8217;d recommend Zoe Street Howe&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Typical-Girls-The-Story-Slits/dp/1847727808/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1352282108&#038;sr=8-1" target="_blank"><strong>Typical Girls? The story of the Slits</strong></a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>4. Bush Tetras</strong></p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='420' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qmn-P4qbIwo?version=3&#038;rel=0&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe>
<p>There’ve been <a href="http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/40071655?uid=3738032&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21100781977701&quot;">whole essays</a> written on this song as key to life in late-70s crisis-riddled New York, but Pat Place’s stabbing guitar and Cynthia Sley’s vocal darting between grouchy imperious disdain and incipient panic are more than enough to recommend it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>5. Lydia Lunch</strong></p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='420' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ecJ9ZaRCQOk?version=3&#038;rel=0&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe>
<p>The infernal anti-Blondie, or perhaps the sub-par Patti Smith. For Lunch, the extent of her musical ability &#8216;wasn&#8217;t the point. I developed my own style, which suited the primal urgency I needed to evacuate from my system&#8217; (quoted in Simon Reynolds&#8217; <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Rip-Up-Start-Again-1978-1984/dp/057121570X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1352282203&#038;sr=1-1" target="_blank"><strong>Rip it Up and Start Again: Postpunk 1978-1984</strong></a>). </p>
<p>Lunch’s performances were, according to contemporary music writer Roy Trakin (quoted <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/No-Wave-Post-Punk-Underground-1976-1980/dp/0810995433" target="_blank">here</a>) ‘very influential in freeing people from the idea of technique as being somehow prerequisite to talent’.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>6. LiLiPUT</strong></p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='420' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ocBJt6Xz0iI?version=3&#038;rel=0&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe>
<p>Surrealistic in their Swiss-German and English lyrics, rudimentary in their technique, and the subject of a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXk0LIpa2i4" target="_blank">40-seconds-long Yummy Fur song</a> (<em>Why don’t you listen to Liliput / Where punk rock starts and ends?</em>), but great for all that.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>7. The Bloods</strong></p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='420' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xnhqi0PqDG4?version=3&#038;rel=0&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe>
<p>New York&#8217;s finest queer anarcha-feminists. &#8216;Button Up&#8217;, their only single, is absurdly ahead of its time kink-funk.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>8. Mo-dettes</strong></p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='420' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/-V7PomVtlz4?version=3&#038;rel=0&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe>
<p>Sharp-tongued and stylish Anglo-Swiss outfit. Had a complicated relationship with the partisan feminism of some of their contemporaries, but their arch, insouciant music was less ambivalent. ‘White Mice’ giddily champions female sexual agency, ‘Two Can Play’ dramatises relationships as struggles for autonomy and control, and ‘Foolish Girl’ catalogues the misadventures of a girl who renounces feminism for an unhappy marital ending.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>9. Au Pairs</strong></p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='420' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/fyMEs2ltssA?version=3&#038;rel=0&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe>
<p>At the intersection of left, feminist, queer and antiracist politics, Birmingham boys and girls the Au Pairs made radical, slyly danceable music. A good introduction to them from the Kitchen Tapes’ Rupinder Parhar <a href="http://www.newleftproject.org/index.php/site/blog_comments/rebel_music_8_the_au_pairs">can be found here</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>10. Linder Sterling</strong></p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='420' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/rvryKnzZtZE?version=3&#038;rel=0&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe>
<p>Muse to Buzzcocks and Morrissey, a visual and performance artist whose work critiqued cultural expectations of women and the commodification of the female body, an unequivocally militant feminist and occasionally a musician with the band Ludus. Ten post-punk points if your response in 2010 to Lady Gaga’s meat dress was to sniffily point out that <a href="http://032c.com/2006/fuck-morrissey-here%E2%80%99s-linder/">Linder did it better</a> at the Hacienda nearly thirty years ago.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[This song was brought into my life a few years ago by my Mum, a reliable source of excellent music.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/09/27/musical-chairs-shes-got-super-power-lovin/" target="_blank"><em>Previous Musical Chair: <strong>Super Sexy Woman</strong> by Sufjan Stevens, picked by Hodge</em></a></p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/nBA2REoRD98?rel=0" frameborder="0" width="500" height="375"></iframe></p>
<p>This song was brought into my life a few years ago by my Mum, a reliable source of excellent music. It&#8217;s a blues standard, but my preferred version is Elmore James&#8217; 1962 recording, with his incredible voice and slide guitar.</p>
<p>While <strong>It Hurts Me Too</strong> is superficially about a man&#8217;s love for a woman who loves another (highly unpleasant) man, to me it could as easily be about platonic love as romantic love. I&#8217;m bringing my own experiences to bear of course, but to me it sits on the same shelf as Strawberry Switchblade&#8217;s <a title="YouTube - Strawberry Switchblade Let Her Go" href="http://youtu.be/pjLjDLto_Eo" target="_blank"><strong>Let Her Go</strong></a> or the Dresden Dolls&#8217; <a title="YouTube - Dresden Dolls Delilah" href="http://youtu.be/rnnMad3c9y4" target="_blank"><strong>Delilah</strong></a>. It&#8217;s about watching from the sidelines, furious and helpless as someone you care about gets hurt, over and over again. For me it is inescapably about abuse.</p>
<p>While the song is old and has been re-interpreted time and again, when Elmore James recorded his version he made some lyrical changes to the hit version recorded by <a title="YouTube - Tampa Red When Things Go Wrong With You" href="http://youtu.be/bYiU5JBiTPE" target="_blank">Tampa Red</a> in 1949. Comparing the two there&#8217;s a subtle shift from a reasonably upbeat song imploring an object of desire to leave a cheating no-gooder, to a heartbreaking lament for the trap in which a loved one has been snared.</p>
<p>For example, <a title="Lyricstime - Tampa Red, When Things Go Wrong With You" href="http://www.lyricstime.com/tampa-red-when-things-go-wrong-with-you-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Tampa Red</a> sings:</p>
<blockquote><p>That man you love, darlin&#8217;<br />
He don&#8217;t want you &#8217;round<br />
Whyn&#8217;t ya make love with Tampa, darling?<br />
And let&#8217;s jump the town<br />
When things go wrong, so wrong, with you<br />
It hurts me, too</p></blockquote>
<p>And James sings:</p>
<blockquote><p>He love another woman, yes, I love you,<br />
But, you love him and stick to him like glue.<br />
When things go wrong, oh, wrong with you<br />
It hurts me too.</p></blockquote>
<p>What I like best about it is that unlike many other blues standards (and plenty of mainstream pop songs &#8211; see Jimi Hendrix&#8217;s <a title="Sing 365 - Hey Joe" href="http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Hey-Joe-lyrics-Jimi-Hendrix/103C62A5FFA678AC4825695F0024E91A" target="_blank"><strong>Hey Joe</strong></a>, The Beatles&#8217; <a title="Songmeanings - Run For Your Life" href="http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/930/" target="_blank"><strong>Run For Your Life</strong></a>, Tom Jones&#8217; <a title="Lyricstime - Delilah" href="http://www.lyrics007.com/Tom%20Jones%20Lyrics/Delilah%20Lyrics.html" target="_blank"><strong>Delilah</strong></a>), <strong>It Hurts Me Too</strong> is a song about empathy, not jealousy. The singer claims no ownership over the woman, it&#8217;s her suffering that pains him, not the fact he can&#8217;t have her. For me, it works as an antidote to the musical tradition of the jealous murder of women by men. I believe it&#8217;s a song about love in the truest, broadest sense: what you feel, I feel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>It Hurts Me Too</strong>  by Elmore James</p>
<p><em>You said you was hurtin&#8217;, you almost lost your mind.<br />
Now, the man you love, he hurt you all the time.<br />
But, when things go wrong, oh, wrong with you, It hurts me too.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll love him more when you should love him less.<br />
Why lick up behind him and take his mess?<br />
But, when things go wrong, whoa, wrong with you, It hurts me too.</p>
<p>He love another woman, yes, I love you,<br />
But, you love him and stick to him like glue.<br />
When things go wrong, oh, wrong with you, It hurts me too.</p>
<p>Now, he better leave you or you better put him down.<br />
No, I won&#8217;t stand to see you pushed around.<br />
But, when things go wrong, oh, wrong with you, It hurts me too.</em></p>

<h3>Super Sexy Woman &#8211; Sufjan Stevens</h3>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/riQ2BLAUqwY" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>A far cry from the dulcet tones of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Swans">Seven Swans</a> (and this was well before the madness of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Adz"><strong>The Age of Adz</strong></a>) &#8211; this is Sufjan Stevens&#8217; description of a &#8216;super sexy woman&#8217;.</p>
<p>Snore?</p>
<p>But then that&#8217;s the weird thing &#8211; she&#8217;s &#8216;super-duper smart&#8217;, complete with &#8216;super-power lovin&#8217; and &#8216;superhuman thighs&#8217;. This is also a woman who &#8216;shoots a super fart (the deadly silent kind)&#8217; and has super-powered lips for &#8216;super suction&#8217;. Perhaps conveniently, she also has &#8216;super-powered hips (for super reproduction&#8217;). Not just for reproduction, though &#8211; she also wears spandex underwear &#8211; and to me this has always felt like a glorious hymn to a woman in all her flawed and genuine glory.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s funny.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since we first wrote on Pussy Riot <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/02/06/revolting-women-slight-return-russias-pussy-riot/">back in February</a>, widespread attention has been given to the subsequent arrest, trial and imprisonment of three members of the group, while <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/15/us-russia-protest-idUSBRE88E06R20120915">mass anti-government protest continues in Russia</a>. From the past few months of coverage and debate, here are just a few things which have interested me on the complexities of Pussy Riot’s background and media presentation.</p>
<p>This (mildly NSFW) video is кисья ересь (Heresy of Little Cats), by the Russian electro-punk band Barto:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/oyMMqUzRa1A?rel=0" frameborder="0" width="420" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>As a non-speaker of Russian who hasn’t found the lyrics anywhere, I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a lot I’m not getting, but I like the song, the band are <a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/arts_n_ideas/article/electro-punk-barto-is-a-band-with-an-ideology/425794.html">pretty admirable</a>, and I like the video’s satirical emphasis on the patriarchal intertwining of political and religious authorities – the formal alliance of Putin’s government and the Russian Orthodox Church, making it possible for civil disobedience to be framed as blasphemy, was a point of contention highlighted by the Pussy Riot trial.</p>
<p>I found the song via <a href="http://myplacefp7.wordpress.com/2012/08/17/get-on-the-way-pussy-riot/">this post</a>, which discusses the relatively muted response by the Russian underground music scene to the group’s trial and imprisonment. It also corrects the impression of Pussy Riot as (merely?) a feminist punk band, when they are more a product of the intersection between political activism and performance art:</p>
<blockquote><p>As a matter of fact Pussy Riot, although calling themselves a punk-band and using the sign of punk in their performances, never belonged to the Russian punk scene. They consider themselves as art-actionists, clearly place themselves in the context of contemporary Russian actionism, quoting the names of Prigov, Brener, Kulik and other art-provocateurs of the 1990s.</p></blockquote>
<p>So Pussy Riot’s frequently mentioned connection with riot grrrl has more to do with the latter’s existence as a DIY subculture involving zines, art, détournement and activism, than with music alone. Which is fair enough; back in the 90s, one of the odder of Courtney Love’s swipes at Kathleen Hanna, in fact, was that “She&#8217;s not really in a band&#8230; She&#8217;s a political activist who took a bunch of women&#8217;s studies classes.&#8221; On the subject of Pussy Riot, Hanna herself had <a title="Kathleen Hanna" href="http://www.kathleenhanna.com/seriously-they-are-in-a-fucking-cage/" target="_blank">this</a> to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>What if people all over the world started their own performance groups, bands, art collectives, etc… and called them things like Pussy Riot Olympia. Pussy Riot, Athens Greece, Pussy Riot Paris, etc….And maybe if this trial turns out as the prosecutors want it to, with the women getting at least 3 years, we all play benefits and go to Russia en masse under the banner that we are all Pussy Riot, Yoko Ono could be in Pussy Riot, Patti Smith could be wearing a mask next to a troupe of girls from Tennesee storming the Cathedral of Christ the Savior screaming “We are all Pussy Riot!!!”</p></blockquote>
<p>As I wrote in February, it makes sense to consider Pussy Riot in the context of the former Soviet Union’s <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/adamcurtis/2012/01/the_years_of_stagnation_and_th.html">long and fascinating history</a> of political protest coalescing around<em> avant garde</em> art and music, especially punk. The Western media, perhaps understandably, tended instead to present the band in more straightforward and simplistic terms – rendering them more comprehensible to a Western audience, sure, but often in a less than helpful manner. I’d been hoping someone would pick up on the patronising and infantilising aspects of much of the media presentation of Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, Maria Alyokhina and Yekaterina Samutsevich, and, in <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/08/manic-pixie-dream-dissidents-how-the-world-misunderstands-pussy-riot/261309/">this article</a>, Sarah Kendzior nails it:</p>
<blockquote><p>Imagine this: The three men sit in court, awaiting their verdict. The youngest, a experienced dissident described by the media as a “sultry sex symbol” with “Angelina Jolie lips”, glances at his colleague, an activist praised by the Associated Press for his “pre-Raphaelite looks”. Between them sits a third man, whose lack of glamour has led the New Republic to label him “the brain” and deem his hair a “poof of dirty blonde frizz”. The dissidents – or “boys” as they are called in headlines around the world – have been the subject of numerous fashion and style profiles ever since they first spoke out against the Russian government. “He’s a flash of moving color,” the New York Times writes approvingly about their protests, “never an individual boy.” If this sounds ridiculous, it should – and not only because I changed the gender… Pussy Riot identifies as feminist, but you would never know it from the Western media, who celebrate the group with the same language that the Russian regime uses to marginalize them. The three members of Pussy Riot are “girls”, despite the fact that all of them are in their twenties and two of them are mothers. They are “punkettes”, diminutive variations on a 1990s indie-rock prototype that has little resemblance to Pussy Riot’s own trajectory as independent artists and activists.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, as Kendzior also points out, Pussy Riot have far more pressing concerns than being mischaracterized in the press. But:</p>
<blockquote><p>Pussy Riot also tells us a lot about how we see non-Western political dissent in the new media age, and could suggest a habit of mischaracterizing their grave mission in terms that feel more familiar but ultimately sell the dissidents short: youthful rebellion, rock and roll, damsels in distress.</p></blockquote>
<p>A lot of this sentiment is familiar: an impulse to treat protest in which women, particularly young women, are prominent, as fun, flippant, and fundamentally unserious. It’s the reverse of the censorious and sensationalist ‘Rage of the Girl Rioters’ response to the 2010 UK student protests. In the case of Pussy Riot, arguments for their sympathetic treatment are often explicitly predicated on the power imbalance involved – they are ‘just’ ordinary women (or indeed ‘girls’), what threat to the state can they possibly pose? – which surely entrenches the idea of women as both relatively powerless and harmless, rather than enabling any sort of feminist empowerment. Away from such frustrating portayals, however, there’s something to be said for the earlier stages of Pussy Riot’s trajectory, which offer examples both of how music can form part of a wider oppositional movement and for how women’s protest can be collective and anonymous, with no need of iconic or martyred figureheads.</p>
<p>And yes, I do realise this post can be summarised as: &#8220;Pussy Riot? Preferred their earlier work, before they got so commercial&#8221;. So it goes.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[VH1 asked Siouxsie not to perform it because it contains references to menstrual blood.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We recently, as a team, <a href="http://www.thisismyjam.com/badrepuk">signed &#8220;BadrepUK&#8221; up to <strong>This Is My Jam</strong></a>. This got me thinking about the songs I might submit to the Grand Communal <del datetime="2012-09-14T21:41:17+00:00">Cacophony</del> Mixtape. Given our name, we kicked off with Joan Jett (of course), but I think the next thing I&#8217;m going to send our Rhian (who is curating the Jams at the moment) is actually this.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a Creatures single from &#8217;99. It&#8217;s an acquired taste. But I like it, for a few reasons.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/UXtKf9nByhc" frameborder="0" width="480" height="360"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Exterminating Angel</strong> was released on a late Creatures album, <strong>Anima Animus</strong>, in 1999, and was still a dancefloor mainstay in the early-to-mid-&#8217;00s in the kind of sticky-floored goth clubs I liked to frequent in my late teens and early 20s.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a weird track in the context of the rest of the album, nearly all of which is gentler, and none of which has the same relentless, malicious, jagged electro edge. It&#8217;s the track you remember the most, with its Biblical, apocalyptic theme and pounding percussion. The rest of the album&#8217;s tracks kind of have to be coaxed out from a musical cupboard-under-the-stairs where they&#8217;ve hidden from its sweeping bite. After picking up the CD &#8211; the day after it and I collided on one of the aforementioned sticky goth dancefloors &#8211; I spent some months hitting the repeat button on <strong>Exterminating Angel</strong>, disappointed that it wasn&#8217;t all like this.</p>
<p>Why I&#8217;m submitting it to BadRep&#8217;s Jam in particular, though, is this: it is entirely from the point of view of the Old Testament&#8217;s Angel of Death, on a mission to kill the sons of Egypt, as per the Bible story. But it&#8217;s not just about that. Maybe it&#8217;s just Siouxsie&#8217;s delivery, or the fact that the lyrics are both about a story where only the sons of privilege count, and disdainful to the back teeth of that fact (&#8220;poor little rich thing&#8221;) &#8211; but I think the angel is very much coded as a vengeful female voice, enacting all the grisly, monstrous, destructive urges that are enshrined as natural in so many men and rarely if at all in women. &#8220;For the hell of it,&#8221; in fact. (VH1 asked Siouxsie not to perform it because it contains references to menstrual blood. Oh, and piss.)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s one of the Unwritten Rules of Siouxsie Sioux that on lyrical face value, one is often only ever half sure what she&#8217;s actually on about<sup><a href="/2012/09/14/musical-chairs-exterminating-angel-by-the-creatures/#footnote_0_12286" id="identifier_0_12286" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" For example, Christine. &ldquo;Now she&rsquo;s in purple, now she&rsquo;s the turtle&rdquo;, anyone? Yeah. This is coherent by comparison. ">1</a></sup>, but I think <strong>Exterminating Angel</strong> is a uniquely beautiful and ugly track. It resonates with me on a deeper level than the Banshees&#8217; single <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hMagNuhLkk"><strong>Cities In Dust</strong></a>, which is about the destruction of Pompeii and is similarly Big, Ancient and World-Ending in scope.</p>
<p>I Googled &#8220;angel of death female&#8221; to compare gendered representations of the angel in the story. Wikipedia popped up first, and helpfully listed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_(personification)">several countries</a> where folklore representations of Death more generally are female (death is a &#8220;she&#8221;, for example, in the folklore of some Slavic communities). But most of the results on my first page weren&#8217;t about the Bible story, or the angel figure, at all.</p>
<p>Instead, they were mainly about other things we apply the phrase &#8220;angel of death&#8221; to in a female-gendered way. Female serial killers abounded, along with headlines about women in the nursing profession (so often referred to in things like Marie Curie Cancer Care literature as &#8220;angels&#8221;) who ill-treated their charges. A few &#8220;sexy nurse &#8211; evil angel of death version with black dress!&#8221; fancy dress costumes completed the picture.</p>
<p>There was nothing particularly mythic or powerful about the way any of these women were framed by the &#8220;angel of death&#8221; phrase, though some were dangerous. And although the gender of mythic death personifications does vary worldwide, the overall tone of my research online about female iterations of this particular mythic and Biblical figure, taken as a whole, was often merely patronising. To get to anything useful, one needed a pair of Sexism Waders.</p>
<p>I think that says it all, really, about why this song mattered to me when I heard it. Female violence is so often either downplayed or fetishised &#8211; witness how long it took women to get to box at Olympic level &#8211; where in men it is normalised (at least as a cultural idea if not a legal reality). And Siouxsie&#8217;s angel is a sort of horrible challenge to that idea. There&#8217;s precisely nothing nice about her whatsoever. Hers is a grand cry of &#8220;Piss on it, I&#8217;m sick of it&#8221; &#8211; and although I&#8217;m generally a friendly sort who&#8217;s about as murderous as a bag of Haribo Starmix, I have a great many days when, re: the patriarchy at least, I can <em>certainly</em> get behind that sentiment.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Recently I was having a wee listen to PJ Harvey  It shouldn't sound unusual, and it occurred to me that I'd not much on the subject of how female desire's presented in pop songs BY WOMEN.
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Here&#8217;s a guest post from author <a href="http://delilahdesanges.wordpress.com/"><strong>Delilah Des Anges</strong></a>. If you have a guest post brewing in your brain, you know what to do: pitch us at <a href="mailto:badrepeditors@gmail.com?Subject=Pitch">badrepeditors@gmail.com</a>.</em></p>
<p>In terms of consumption and emotional language, the pop song occupies a similar status to the sonnet. Well, not exactly, but certainly for the purpose of romance or desire, pop lyrics are an absolute boon for the tongue-tied (a group which includes &#8220;most of the English population&#8221;). They&#8217;re used to express whatever happens to be lurking unformed in the minds of the listener, and as a point of identification when the lurking stuff has been given a concrete identity.</p>
<p>Reams have been written about the depiction of women in pop music by male songwriters and the presentation of women by the music industry, but recently I was having a wee listen to PJ Harvey (while drunk in someone&#8217;s living room in Portsmouth on a Saturday night, because I am very cool) and it occurred to me that I&#8217;d not seen as much on the subject of how female desire&#8217;s presented in pop songs BY WOMEN.</p>
<p>This thought came up because <strong>This Is Love</strong> felt like an anomaly: it presented desire as active on the part of the female narrator. PJ Harvey&#8217;s persona for the song has sexual agency, and longings that do not centre around waiting for someone else to make a move. She uses the phrase &#8220;I want&#8221; and backs it up with action: &#8220;to chase you round the table, wanna touch your head&#8221;, and in that &#8220;wanna touch your&#8221; she rather casually and without fuss flips the entire common model of heterosexual desire on its head by pointing out that women also want to touch, as well as being touched.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/STxXS5lLunE" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>It shouldn&#8217;t sound unusual, and yet at the time of listening it was borderline revolutionary, at least to me. There are other lines from the song which imply action: &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe that the axis turns on suffering when you taste so good&#8221;; suggestive of all kinds of sexual acts, instigated by and controlled by the narrator, but nothing else is quite as direct as that seemingly harmless &#8220;wanna touch your head&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>This Is Love</strong> is not unique, but on examination it becomes harder to find other songs which inhabit the same active, instigating desire.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/KUgvVAFFzN8" frameborder="0" width="480" height="360"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>I Just Wanna Make Love To You</strong> does, but even the Divinyls&#8217; famously salacious anthem to female masturbation and banned song <strong>I Touch Myself</strong> is self-contained sexuality; the desire is there, but it is self-directed. The narrator says nothing of what she wants to do to the object of the song, only what the thought of him makes her do to herself!</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/wv-34w8kGPM" frameborder="0" width="480" height="360"></iframe></p>
<p>Interestingly, when the object of desire is no longer male, the desire becomes more active in its expression: contentious and open to a variety of interpretations, Katy Perry&#8217;s <strong>I Kissed A Girl</strong> does at least carry the flow of action from the narrator to her object of desire: Katy KISSED a girl, rather than being kissed BY a girl, as so many heroines of pop songs are kissed BY a boy rather than kissing him.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/llmGx2WHeww" frameborder="0" width="480" height="360"></iframe></p>
<p>In a song of the same name, Jill Sobule&#8217;s narrator makes the same distinction: Jill KISSES Jenny, the narrator as the actor rather than the acted-upon.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/8FdwUGwasck" frameborder="0" width="480" height="360"></iframe></p>
<p>This is a small sample to draw a conclusion from, but it is intriguing that female desire is more acceptable as active, instigating, and potentially dominant when the object of the woman&#8217;s desire is also female. The repurposing of songs originally intended for male singers often underscores this, as in Patti Smith&#8217;s cover of <strong>Gloria</strong>.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/JL2I1krvhIE" frameborder="0" width="480" height="360"></iframe></p>
<p>There are songs with male narrators in which the instigation of action is undertaken by the female half of the heterosexual proto-couple (usually because the narrator is far too shy or lacking in confidence, rather than because of any societal prohibition on his asking her out): the main contender in this category is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FC3y9llDXuM"><strong>Teenage Dirtbag</strong> by Wheatus</a>. A casual glance over popular music seems to reveal far more male references to female desire (&#8220;she wants me&#8221;) than female references to female desire (&#8220;I want him&#8221;).</p>
<p>PJ Harvey is not, of course, the first or only female artist to sing about desire. Ani Difranco has filled several albums with heartfelt songs cataloging the effects of desire on the psyche: primarily in the aftermath. Ani writes about regret or lack thereof, but rarely if at all about the white-hot moment of simple wanting.</p>
<p>By now there&#8217;s a good chance you&#8217;re wondering how anyone could skip over Bikini Kill on this subject: they have a song <em>entitled</em> <strong>I Like Fucking</strong> &#8211; surely this must qualify for a candid and unabashed demonstration of naked female desire?</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/kwh7iilWrp0" frameborder="0" width="480" height="360"></iframe></p>
<p>Well, yes and no. Riot Grrrl has an agenda which is unshy of communicating, and sexuality is, as all other aspects of feminine experience, politicised. The song itself discusses internal obstacles to feeling and acting upon desire, the ubquity of rape, and the &#8220;radical possibilities of pleasure&#8221;, which while a notable feminist sentiment on the reclamation of sexuality, is a far cry from Harvey&#8217;s &#8220;I just want to sit here and watch you undress&#8221;. Politicised recognition of the rightness of female desire and its value is highly important, but isn&#8217;t quite the same thing as an unselfconscious expression of that desire.</p>
<p>Someone else who believes in the radical possibilities of pleasure, even if she doesn&#8217;t phrase it that way, is Rihanna. In <strong>Shut Up And Drive</strong>, she creates a shallow but effective metaphor in which she is a car to be driven: it is potent, referencing power and femininity, but ultimately it is &#8211; no matter how transparent and brazen &#8211; a metaphor and rerouting of desire through the stalking-horse of car culture, rather than the bald, outright statement of <strong>This Is Love</strong>.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/up7pvPqNkuU" frameborder="0" width="640" height="360"></iframe></p>
<p>I could go on, but I&#8217;m sure the general idea is clear. That was my little radio revolution, thanks to Polly Harvey, and with any luck I&#8217;ve given you something to think about too.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Delilah Des Anges</strong> is given to unnecessarily close examination of song lyrics, but excuses it by writing <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=delilah+des+anges+poetry&amp;rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Adelilah+des+anges+poetry&amp;ajr=0">poems</a>. She also writes <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=delilah+des+anges">novels</a>, for which she has rather less excuse.</li>

<p>This post was mostly inspired by the complaint of my fellow BadRep member Sarah J that, when the subject of Elastica comes up, the band are frequently dismissed outright as flagrant copyists led by Britpop&#8217;s version of Lady Macbeth. In fairness, I spent most of the 90s thinking the same thing. God, I used to hate Elastica. Wilfully amateur slack-jawed rip-off merchants whose over-privileged frontwoman seemed to exist only as a drawly amalgam of her indie boyfriends (hair by Brett, boots by Damon), whose competency in snagging the catchiest bits of post-punk couldn’t disguise how irritatingly thick and bland they were in all other respects. Right? Right. Now that I&#8217;m no longer a chippy thirteen-year-old convinced that people with trust-funds can&#8217;t make good music, I&#8217;ve been reassessing Elastica.</p>

Image via Wikipedia, shared under Fair Use guidelines." width="220" height="79" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Elastica are a band it&#8217;s probably easier to appreciate in retrospect and in isolation from their era, especially if you weren&#8217;t actually around for it. They weren&#8217;t a great fit with Britpop, their music drawing more on the punk revivalism of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_wave_of_new_wave">New Wave of New Wave</a>, one of several burgeoning movements which Britpop left steamrollered in its wake. This 70s-rooted recycling was also ahead of its time, being more of a piece with the early-2000s bands also inspired by post-punk: like Karen O, or Jack White, Justine Frischmann now just looks like a cool-as-fuck frontperson. I mean, she <em>was</em> posh, of course. If she called her dad, not only could he stop it all but in 1989 he could also buy her a Kensington townhouse. Not that she ever tried to hide this, or to claim any kind of gritty authenticity. (Given that the British music press, and music in general, was and remains riddled with posh girls and boys, I do wonder how much of the media focus on this aspect was some kind of overdefensive deflection on their part, back in the insulting and appropriative days of poor-is-cool.)</p>
<p>Elastica&#8217;s potted biography reads like a Britpop potboiler &#8211; or, in accounts like John Harris&#8217;, <a href="http://damonalbarnunofficial.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/indie-soap-opera-justine-frischmann.html">an &#8216;indie soap opera&#8217;</a>. Frischmann founded Suede with her fellow UCL student Brett Anderson in 1989, hawking the embryonic group around Camden as their <em>de facto</em> manager before leaving both Suede and Anderson for her iconic power-coupling with chancer <em>extraordinaire</em>, Blur&#8217;s Damon Albarn. In 1992 she formed her own group with former Suede drummer Justin Welch, adding enigmatic Brightonian bassist Annie Holland (who ended up with her own <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4m5WC63BfU">theme song</a>) and south Welsh urchin Donna Matthews as Frischmann&#8217;s musical foil on guitar. In 1993 they released <strong>Stutter</strong>, a crushingly cool eyeroll of a single that, having something to do with male sexual dysfunction and something to do with female sexual frustration, was one of the most playfully frank songs I’d heard since <strong>Orgasm Addict</strong>. The next year, as Britpop was decisively yanked into the mainstream, Frischmann’s relationship with Blur&#8217;s lead singer gained her lasting notoriety in the music press and beyond as a kind of Britpop <a href="http://venturefans.org/vbwiki/Dr._Girlfriend">Dr Girlfriend</a>.</p>

<p>I’ll come to the fuss made over Justine’s sex life later. The <em>other</em> Thing That Everyone Knows About Elastica is that they stole all their best riffs. Well, yes, Elastica settled out of court with both Wire (<strong>Line Up</strong>, a song I&#8217;m still happy to hate, rips off the chorus of Wire&#8217;s <strong>I Am the Fly</strong>; the synth in <strong>Connection</strong> rips off the guitar in <strong>Three Girl Rhumba</strong>) and the Stranglers (<strong>Waking Up</strong> rips off <strong>No More Heroes</strong> pretty much wholesale) &#8211; but let&#8217;s think about this. Britpop itself was incredibly derivative, backwards-looking, insular and self-referential, as were its exponents. The entire exercise was a cultural and aesthetic rip-off of the late 1960s, and more particularly of the Beatles-Kinks-Jam tradition of white-boy guitar rock. Musical, lyrical and sartorial rip-offs (or &#8216;tributes&#8217;, or &#8216;homages&#8217;, or &#8216;cheeky nods to&#8217;) abounded, as indeed they do in any period and genre. In music as in any art form, it&#8217;s what one does with it that counts. I still rate <strong>Cigarettes and Alcohol</strong>, for instance, despite its massive musical debt to T-Rex&#8217;s <strong>Get It On</strong>, and despite Oasis&#8217; massive debt in general to, oh, let&#8217;s start with the Beatles, Status Quo, Slade and the Glitter Band.</p>
<p>If it were simply a case of, to misquote an unknown wit, &#8216;Your album is both good and original. But the part that is good is not original, and the part that is original is not good&#8217;, that would be one thing. But there is a reason why 1995&#8217;s <strong>Elastica</strong> became the fastest-selling debut in UK history at the time. Even in the throes of my irritation with Frischmann herself, I found the music slickly derivative, sure, but also annoyingly listenable. The songs on the debut &#8211; which it took me about three years to grudgingly buy and listen to in full &#8211; are sharp, snarky and unadorned gems strung together by that snide, campy <em>Sprechgesang</em> that was probably Justine&#8217;s best musical asset. The songs range from little flash-bangs of sex-positive brilliance (<strong>Stutter</strong>, <strong>All-Nighter</strong>, <strong>Blue</strong>, <strong>Vaseline</strong>), to vaguely sinister languor (<strong>S.O.F.T</strong>, <strong>2:1</strong>, <strong>Waking Up</strong>), to the archly anthemic (<strong>Car Song</strong>, <strong>Line Up</strong>, <strong>Connection</strong>). The album’s stripped-down, angular art-punk, its odd, listless mix of sleaze and melancholy, and the band&#8217;s Last Gang In Town fronting in photographs and on record sleeves, anticipated the revival (or the ripping-off, perhaps?) of such stylings almost a decade later by the Strokes/Libertines axis of hipster. And when thinking back to the bands who came to be regarded as luminaries towards the tail-end of Britpop &#8211; The Bluetones, Shed 7, Northern Uproar, and no doubt I&#8217;ve repressed many more &#8211; you can only wish they&#8217;d ripped off something half as interesting themselves.</p>

<p>At a point in the 90s where the dominant female aesthetic revolved around ladette football shirts or twee tea-dresses, Elastica adopted an atypical New Wave uniform: black leather, drainpipe jeans, hair boyishly cropped or bobbed. For Frischmann at least, her androgynous aesthetic was a deliberate choice linked to self-consciousness, a protective effacing or subsuming of femininity which will make sense to anyone who&#8217;s tried to negotiate the disputed territory of being socially independent while aware of one&#8217;s relative vulnerability. In an interview with Simon Reynolds in 1995, Justine referred to her choice of look as &#8216;Nineties urban camouflage&#8217;, and, interestingly, associated the process of growing up with learning to step away from a conventionally feminine presentation rather than accepting it:</p>
<blockquote><p>[JF]&#8230;When you&#8217;re in your twenties you feel more confident about what you are, you don&#8217;t feel like you necessarily have to dress up for boys. When I was a teenager I had really long hair and felt like I had to wear make-up. But now I feel a lot more comfortable with short hair. It&#8217;s something I discovered with leaving home and going to college. In a way, it&#8217;s Nineties urban camoflage. It came about when I was coming back from college really late, getting on the last tube. If you&#8217;re wearing long hair and make-up, you&#8217;re gonna feel a lot more vulnerable than if you&#8217;ve got short hair and big boots&#8230;</p>
<p>[SR] So there&#8217;s a sense that you sartorially avoid the things that signify vulnerability or &#8216;availability&#8217;?</p>
<p>[JF] It&#8217;s just expecting to be treated as one of the lads. You don&#8217;t want to deliberately remove yourself from being able to be a good bloke.</p>
<p>&#8211; <a href="http://reynoldsretro.blogspot.co.uk/2007/09/elastica-interview-melody-maker-march.html">Source.</a></p></blockquote>
<p>NB I like Reynolds&#8217; idea, in this interview, of women artists in the 90s &#8216;taking on played-out male traditions, tweaking and reinventing them&#8217;, but I&#8217;m not altogether sure how helpful it is to dub it &#8216;stylistic transvestism&#8217; as he does, rather than simply problematising &#8216;feminine&#8217; identity itself. (He&#8217;s on steadier ground when he mentions Buzzcocks, who Elastica remind me of especially in songs like <strong>Stutter</strong> and <strong>All-Nighter</strong>, with Justine&#8217;s nonchalantly transgressive blurring of gender norms suggesting a southern female mirror-image of Pete Shelley, but maybe that&#8217;s just me.)</p>
<p>On &#8216;stylistic transvestism&#8217;, she seemed similarly doubtful:</p>
<blockquote><p>[SR] Drag kings rule: Polly Jean Harvey with her hoary blues-man posturings; Courtney Love as Henry Rollins if he&#8217;d only remove his &#8216;Iron Man&#8217; emotional armature and let his &#8216;feminine side&#8217; splurge&#8217;n&#8217;splatter; Liz Phair and her feminised/feminist take on the geeky garage punk of Paul Westerberg of the Replacements. And there&#8217;s Justine Frischmann, who&#8217;s somehow miraculously found imaginative space for herself in the Stranglers&#8217; gruff, fake-prole belligerence and &#8216;who wants the world?&#8217; cynicism. That said, Justine&#8217;s pretty phazed when I ask if she ever feels like she&#8217;s in drag onstage.</p>
<p>[JF] Well, I sometimes feel like Meatloaf, when I&#8217;ve got hair all over my face and I&#8217;m really sweaty. Which is a bit depressing. But no, I don&#8217;t ever feel like a woman in drag, to be honest.</p>
<p>[SR] So there&#8217;s no sense in which you play-act a tough-guy?</p>
<p>[JF] I think lots of women do that these days. And there&#8217;s always been girly girls and non-girly girls. There&#8217;s girls who have really high voices and like wearing dresses, and others who don&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m exceptional, it&#8217;s just that most of my mates haven&#8217;t been very girly. There&#8217;s lots of young women in London who look and dress like I do.</p>

<p>Even when I was forcing myself to dislike her on grounds of class chippiness, one of the things I couldn’t help liking about Justine was the casual confidence, the superiority even, in so much of her lyrics and delivery, and their emphasis on female sexual agency. <strong>All-Nighter</strong> is, like <strong>Stutter</strong>, a self-assured and playful song about sexual frustration, and there&#8217;s an archly objective approach to sex in <strong>Car Song</strong> and <strong>Vaseline</strong> and many more. There&#8217;s &#8216;just&#8217; sex in these songs &#8211; little sentiment and less romance &#8211; but equally there&#8217;s little angst, no judgement and no self-reproach. <strong>Never Here</strong> is a heartfelt, simple and incisive anatomy of a defunct relationship, just as well-crafted and moving as, say, Blur’s <strong>Tender</strong>, but terse and economic where the latter is overblown. Frischmann&#8217;s protagonists are thinly drawn but invariably assertive and self-possessed, frustrated or impatient with their hapless, thoughtless or less self-assured partners, sure of what they want and feeling no guilt about taking it. They never make a point of being Bad Girls, they just happen to be girls.</p>
<p>Like her fellow Stranglers aficionado <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/11/30/gaye-advert-and-the-great-cock-n-balls-swindle/">Gaye Advert</a> twenty years previously, Frischmann&#8217;s drop-dead charisma got in the way of her stated intention to be &#8216;one of the lads&#8217;. Her sexually confident persona and Elastica&#8217;s pleasure-centred, borderline-selfish lyrics, despite their matter-of-fact delivery, tended to be treated as &#8216;naughtily&#8217; deviant departures from feminine convention rather than just another way in which women might happen to view themselves and their sex lives. That the music press and wider media insistently framed Justine in relation to the men she chose to sleep with was part of a wider sexualisation where, in the post-Britpop 90s, female sexual agency had increasingly to be presented within a Lad frame of reference. I remember, specifically, there being a weird concentration by the music press on whether she would or wouldn&#8217;t pose for <strong>Playboy</strong>. It&#8217;s tempting to conclude that Frischmann&#8217;s ostensibly aloof and independent approach, her chilled assertiveness, her androgyny, and perhaps her background, attracted a reductive emphasis on her sexuality and sex life as a way of rendering her comprehensible, less of a threat and more of a &#8216;regular&#8217; girl.</p>
<p>Women weren&#8217;t absent from 90s indie, but <a href="http://upclosemaspersonal.blogspot.com/2012/03/lost-girls.html">as I&#8217;ve written elsewhere</a>, there is a sense in which they were squeezed to the margins by the elevation of &#8216;lad bands&#8217;, the testosterone-heavy dominance (with some honourable and dishonourable exceptions) of the music press and mens&#8217; magazines, and the focus on male key players and kingmakers, from Anderson, Albarn and the Gallaghers to Alan McGee. The received wisdom of Britpop as a male concern and male preserve obscures how highly-rated Elastica were at the time &#8211; notably, they came closer than either Oasis or Blur to cracking the lucrative US market &#8211; and it also overlooks the contribution made by Frischmann to Britpop&#8217;s originating impulse. Love or hate it, Frischmann&#8217;s influence on and creative partnerships with (or, if we&#8217;re going with the Lady Macbeth angle, her bewitching and manipulation of) Britpop&#8217;s main men was instrumental to the movement but goes more or less unsung. Instead she now gets frequently relegated to a minor player, an accessory or at best a &#8216;muse&#8217; to the more famous and credible men in her life, and her band are remembered as, in Sarah J&#8217;s words, a &#8216;Blurgirlfriend novelty act&#8217;. Her break-up with Albarn in 1997 was partly the result of a reluctance to accept what she perceived as the restrictions of domesticity and motherhood:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Damon was saying to me, &#8216;You&#8217;ve given me a run for my money, you&#8217;ve proved that you&#8217;re just as good as I am, you&#8217;ve had a hit in America &#8211; now settle down and let&#8217;s have kids.&#8217; He wanted me to stop being in a group, stop touring and have children. I wasn&#8217;t very happy, and he kept saying, &#8216;The reason you&#8217;re unhappy is because you really want children but you don&#8217;t know it.&#8217; It did throw me: I thought about it quite seriously.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="http://damonalbarnunofficial.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/indie-soap-opera-justine-frischmann.html">Source.</a></p></blockquote>

Image via wikipedia, shared under fair use guidelines." width="278" height="192" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>After 1996 Elastica were gradually subsumed by smack, angst and inter-band acrimony, with an endless parade of members leaving, being replaced and returning. Their second album, 2000&#8217;s <strong>The Menace</strong>, was more firmly anchored in post-punk experimentalism, but lacklustre, anticlimactic and accordingly less than commercial &#8211; although I had by this point got over myself enough to admit that I liked it, an epiphany which I&#8217;m sure was a source of extraordinary comfort for the band, who announced their amicable break-up the following year. Since then, Frischmann has been a bit of a Renaissance woman: collaborating with M.I.A. on songs including 2003&#8217;s <strong>Galang</strong>; moving to Colorado to study visual arts and psychology; dipping into abstract painting; and, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOlnQfTKoU4">as shown here</a>, fronting a BBC series on modern architecture.</p>
<p>Justine Frischmann&#8217;s rise against a Britpop backdrop, and her subsequent infamy or dismissal, raises several issues relevant to feminism: the denial or marginalizing of women&#8217;s contributions to artistic and creative moments; the relegation of women to the accessory of whichever man they happen to have slept with; the idea that women in bands are automatically amateur or derivative, or just not as good at being amateur and derivative as the boys are. However short-lived Elastica&#8217;s fame and drawn-out their dissipated demise, their career remains more edifying than watching the Oasis juggernaut run slowly and embarrassingly out of steam, or indeed whatever Alex James is currently up to.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><strong>Ah! Forget My Fate Part II</strong> consists of an ambitious three-woman staging of Purcell&#8217;s most famous opera, Dido and Aeneas.

<p>It&#8217;s been a little while since we heard from <a href="http://www.betterstrangersopera.com/"><strong>Better Strangers Feminist Opera Collective</strong></a>. Back in November last year, our Sarah C <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/11/15/a-little-feminist-queer-opera-music/">interviewed them about their show &#8211; the first part of their <strong>Ah! Forget My Fate!</strong></a> project. Hodge and I went to the show &#8211; &#8220;part-opera, part-cabaret abridged history of women in opera&#8221; &#8211; and I&#8217;d definitely recommend them.</p>

<p><strong><br />
Why would a feminist opera company put on Dido and Aeneas?<br />
</strong><br />
&#8220;Because in many ways, <strong>Dido and Aeneas</strong> is where it all started. Whether or not <strong>Dido and Aeneas</strong> is the first opera in Western classical tradition is up for (interminable and pedantic) debate, but it&#8217;s certainly one of the earliest that&#8217;s regularly performed – particularly here in the UK where we&#8217;re based. And Dido is the first in a noble tradition of heroines who die an arguably completely pointless death (in the context of the opera as a self-contained work, anyway), so to me it makes sense for us to begin at the beginning.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was also written, we think, to be performed by a girls&#8217; school, which makes it well suited for modern adaptations with exclusively female voices.</p>
<p>&#8220;A personal motivation for me is that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dido_(Queen_of_Carthage)"><strong>Dido</strong></a> is a really interesting feminist figurehead. As a ruler, she refused to submit to any kind of conquest (sexual, emotional or literal) from the men around her, and she earned the respect of her people through an ironclad adherence to an ideal.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>What will audiences take away from BSFOC&#8217;s telling of the story? Why does it need to be (re)told?</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;As a producer/director, the main question I want to ask of the work is why Dido dies. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s ultimately led me personally to the staging we&#8217;re about to present here. I don&#8217;t believe that people die of a broken heart, unless they have some kind of congenital heart defect, and I don&#8217;t believe that the queen of Carthage has the kind of emotional pallor that lends itself to dying of a hissy fit after the bloke you&#8217;ve known for a couple of days decides it&#8217;s time to move on. I want there to be a driving force behind it. I want to know what it is about the witches that gives them such power over Dido.</p>
<p>&#8220;People who aren&#8217;t familiar with classical mythology, and the Aeneid in particular, aren&#8217;t all that likely to know much about Dido, and you&#8217;re certainly not going to learn anything about her from the text of Purcell&#8217;s opera. Our telling of the story – the recasting of the witches as the shadow selves of the named characters – is intended to help to fill in the blanks. Nahum Tate (librettist)&#8217;s Dido is not controlling, masochistic, or even particularly bold, and that is why Dido&#8217;s shadow self – and, by extension, the witches – have so much power. The impulse is there, and is all the more irresistible for going unrecognised.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to retell Dido and Aeneas because I love Dido and I can&#8217;t stand Aeneas. If you take Tate&#8217;s text by itself, she&#8217;s nothing but a puppet at his mercy, and I don&#8217;t want that for her. I want her to have agency, even if it&#8217;s an agency that no-one can quite understand. And I want him to look like a tool, because he is.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Imagine I know nothing about opera and classical literature. What background knowledge do I need to acquire to appreciate what you&#8217;re doing with this production? Is it reasonable to assume the audiences won&#8217;t know much either? How will you help them into the opera?</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Basically, I would like to transmit the idea that Dido&#8217;s story runs deeper than the text of the opera implies. I think we&#8217;re helping the audience along there with the addition of newspapers, which help to flesh out what might be going on beyond the confines of Dido&#8217;s palace and what kind of impact her dalliances might be having outside. In the mythology, Dido is a really great ruler who is essentially completely derailed by Aeneas&#8217; arrival on the scene. I want the audience to get a sense of that.</p>
<p>&#8220;I also want to transmit the idea that Dido&#8217;s death, to me, seems impossible without the impulse towards self-destruction.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think – or, at least, I hope – that this production will be reasonably accessible to people who have neither a classical music nor classical historical background, and I&#8217;d be interested to hear what needs to be drawn out of the narrative and the staging to make it so.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>You want to take your production to schools/colleges. What do you hope to teach young people about? Opera? Feminism? Purcell&#8217;s era? Classical lit? Tropes?</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;A variety of things. I&#8217;d like to teach everyone in a school – meaning also the staff – how you can adapt a work like <strong>Dido and Aeneas</strong> to be performable by small forces, because I think that&#8217;s one of our major achievements with it. I want to teach performers how to be creative with limited resources, and to encourage them to think about alternative readings.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to teach people to sing, and not to be afraid of singing. That would be a unifying motivation in any educational work I do with Better Strangers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Back when I was doing GCSEs, <strong>Dido&#8217;s Lament</strong> came up as a regularly used example of how melody + basso continuo worked, so I think it could be a great set of lessons to people aged 13+ of how Purcell&#8217;s music was constructed and how his melodies, instrumentation and word-setting were put together. I think it would be more fun and probably more instructive for people to do this/see it done in performance.</p>
<p>&#8220;And, yes, I&#8217;d like to use it as an opportunity to teach story-makers of the future that they might want to think about why, precisely, they want to kill off their lead [insert kyriarchal minority here] character rather than resolve the plot some other way.&#8221;</p>
