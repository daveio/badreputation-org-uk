										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I once spent three years researching a particular widow, on and off.</p>
<p>The Duchess at the centre of John Webster&#8217;s play <strong>The Duchess of Malfi</strong> (1612-13) acquires a lot of her edginess in the original play from the fact that her husband has died before the action begins. She is a young – and according to her brother Ferdinand, &#8220;lusty&#8221; – widow, whose combination of financial independence and sexual experience makes many in her vicinity nervous.</p>
<p>The equivalent man would be called &#8220;eligible&#8221;, and receive a lot of invitations from women with marriageable daughters. But a woman in the same situation becomes the subject of a campaign of surveillance and torture which ends in her death.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/W-is-for-Widow.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="4346" data-permalink="/2011/03/28/an-alphabet-of-feminism-23-w-is-for-widow/w-is-for-widow/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/W-is-for-Widow.jpg?fit=1418%2C1582&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1418,1582" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="W is for Widow" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/W-is-for-Widow.jpg?fit=268%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/W-is-for-Widow.jpg?fit=917%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4346" alt="A victorian woman dressed in black with a black bonnet, wearing a shawl made out of black net, surrounded by bags of money." src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/W-is-for-Widow-268x300.jpg?resize=268%2C300" width="268" height="300" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/W-is-for-Widow.jpg?w=268&amp;ssl=1 268w, https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/W-is-for-Widow.jpg?w=917&amp;ssl=1 917w, https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/W-is-for-Widow.jpg?w=1418&amp;ssl=1 1418w" sizes="(max-width: 268px) 100vw, 268px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>The more I worked on Webster’s play, the more I noticed that the Duchess was part of a much larger cultural anxiety around the figure of the widow in English literature. She’s an extreme case, admittedly: few other fictional widows end up eating apricots grown in horse dung, kissing the severed hand of their husband or being strangled on the orders of their lycanthropic and potentially incestuous twin brother.</p>
<p>But a continual low charge hums around widows, from the comic grotesque of Widow Twankey to the alluringly threatening Black Widows of gangster novels. Via the Wife of Bath, the Dowager Duchess of Grantham and Aouda from <strong>Eighty Days Around The World</strong>, to take a handful nearly at random.</p>
<p>Of course it alters across the eras, but time and time again, the figure of the widow acts as a focus for drama.</p>
<p>Sometimes the charge seems to derive from the fact that she is no longer dependent upon any man, or socially &#8220;explained&#8221; via her relationship to a father or husband. Sometimes it comes instead from the way a widow is seen as <em>over</em>-defining herself in relation to a man no longer present.</p>
<p>Either way, widows in literature often hold the potential to disrupt social order in a variety of ways.</p>
<h2>Widows and Pseudowidows</h2>
<p>This article, however, is not about widows. It is about women who are <em>not</em> widows. Or rather, women who aren’t widows whilst still looking, sounding, or acting like them.</p>
<p>When considering famous widows in literature, it struck me that two of the names that sprang to mind – Miss Havisham in Dickens&#8217;s <strong>Great Expectations</strong> and Olivia in Shakespeare&#8217;s <strong>Twelfth Night</strong> – don’t technically fit the criteria.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/missh.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="13848" data-permalink="/2013/10/22/veiled-threats-widows-and-pseudowidows-12/missh/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/missh.jpg?fit=620%2C413&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="620,413" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="missh" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/missh.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/missh.jpg?fit=620%2C413&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright  wp-image-13848" alt="missh" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/missh.jpg?resize=372%2C248" width="372" height="248" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Miss Havisham’s veil is worn to mourn the marriage that never happened, whilst Olivia’s is to remind her of her dead brother, whose memory stops her from wanting to receive suitors. Nonetheless, they both look to me as if they’re trying to take on the role, adopting some of the characteristics associated with grieving spouses.</p>
<p>They wear specific clothes to mark their separation from other people (and from their previous selves), withdraw from normal social life, and refuse to put themselves under the jurisdiction of men. Neither are exactly successful in their attempt to construct themselves positively within the role of a widow.</p>
<p>Miss Havisham has become an icon of &#8220;frustrated&#8221; and &#8220;twisted&#8221; womanhood, unsuccessful within the novel’s plot and the butt of jokes in subsequent culture. She becomes a “tragic” figure in both the classical and slang senses of the word: an image of wronged heroism in her own mind, and a sad bitter spinster to the world outside.</p>
<p>Her veil, usually a temporary garment to mark her passing between two states, becomes a fixture, blending with the cobwebs which now cover her wedding cake. In Miss Havisham, Dickens created a figure who memorably combines the revulsion and anxiety felt by Victorian (and later) society towards women who refuse to play out the social roles ascribed to them.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Charles_Robert_Leslie_Olivia.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="13846" data-permalink="/2013/10/22/veiled-threats-widows-and-pseudowidows-12/charles_robert_leslie_olivia/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Charles_Robert_Leslie_Olivia.jpg?fit=474%2C599&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="474,599" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Charles_Robert_Leslie,_Olivia" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Charles_Robert_Leslie_Olivia.jpg?fit=237%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Charles_Robert_Leslie_Olivia.jpg?fit=474%2C599&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright  wp-image-13846" alt="Charles_Robert_Leslie,_Olivia" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Charles_Robert_Leslie_Olivia.jpg?resize=284%2C359" width="284" height="359" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Olivia from <strong>Twelfth Night</strong> is similarly associated with a veil, at least at the beginning of the play. The first thing we hear about her is that for seven years the world “Shall not behold her face at ample view/ But, like a cloistress, she will veiled walk&#8230;all this to season/ A brother’s dead love, which she would keep fresh/ And lasting in her memory”.</p>
<p>When Viola (dressed as the male Cesario) manages to speak to her, Olivia prepares by putting her veil back on, setting up the comedy by-play in which Viola claims not to know who the lady of the house is, and the moment when Olivia pulls it back and demands “Look you, sir, such a one I was this present. Is’t not well done?”</p>
<p>Within the first act the grieving Olivia’s attempt to seclude herself is defeated by a combination of plot and Viola’s rhetorical skills. The play treats her mourning as one of the restrictive, self-imposed roles which so many of the characters are trapped in as the action begins. Orsino is locked into his schtick as self-obsessed Petrarchan lover, Sir Toby as the party knight who slinks home in the early hours of every morning, Malvolio as the image of Puritan rectitude and Olivia as the grieving veiled figure wandering inconsolably around her rooms as if her husband had just died.</p>
<p>These roles are all disrupted for the audience’s amusement and the characters’ correction during the ensuing scenes, with the play particularly conspiring to trick Olivia out of her image of herself as a grand widow. There’s an echo here of Miss Havisham, though in a very different key: women are not permitted to adopt the role of widow simply because they want to.</p>
<p>Both characters are diverted away from a successful performance as “pseudowidows” by the narratives in which they appear: Olivia to happy marriage and Miss Havisham to pathological bitterness and mockery.</p>
<h2>&#8216;A veil of wickedness&#8217;</h2>
<p>In fact we don’t have to rely on my close-reading of these fictional texts to find anxiety around women “playing” at being widows. That harping on Olivia wearing a veil and walking secluded from men “like a cloistress” brings another group of women into play, whose apparent freedom from male jurisdiction has produced anger and revulsion in various eras.</p>
<p>I don’t have space to examine the way in which nuns in the Middle Ages navigated the rhetoric of “brides of Christ” alongside the reality that many entered the community after the death of a husband, or their social position. But one particular case stands out amongst the criticism of female religious orders: the bishop of Olmüt’s attack on the Beguines.</p>
<p>These women, who lived together in small self-governing groups, taking few vows and following the Rule of no specific order, were the subject of a lot of criticism in the later thirteenth century. Bruno, the bishop in question, wrote to the pope in 1273 to demand they be suppressed.</p>
<p>In R.W. Southern’s words:</p>
<blockquote><p>he complained that&#8230;the women used their liberty as a veil of wickedness in order to escape the yoke of obedience to their priests and ‘the coercion of marital bonds’. Above all, he was indignant that young women should assume the status of widowhood against the authority of the Apostle who approved no widows under the age of sixty.</p></blockquote>
<p>The bishop was referring to verses in the New Testament book of 1 Timothy, in which instructions are given for the way the “order of widows” should be run and who should be admitted. These women, who worked for the church and were provided with support, should all be over the age of sixty, have a good reputation and previously carried out pious works.</p>
<p>Obviously “widow” has a technical significance in this Biblical passage, but I was fascinated by Bruno’s line of attack: that the young women of the Beguines were setting themselves up <em>as if</em> they were widows, and thus escaping male authority.</p>
<p>His metaphor of a &#8220;veil of wickedness&#8221; once again acts as a focus for male anxiety over women who won’t accept their assigned role.</p>
<p>In part two of this post, I&#8217;ll delve into widow imagery in modern TV and film, including <strong>The Gilmore Girls</strong> and <strong>Four Weddings and a Funeral</strong>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>A little late in being posted, perhaps, but hopefully still of interest! In which three BadReppers &#8211; <strong>Hannah Chutzpah</strong>, <strong>Stephen B</strong> and <strong>Viktoriya</strong> &#8211; chat about their experiences at <strong>Nine Worlds Geekfest</strong> this summer, and more generally about conventions, fandom and feminism.</em></p>
<h2>A more inclusive con?</h2>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/9w.jpeg"><img data-attachment-id="14010" data-permalink="/2013/09/11/what-does-an-inclusive-sci-fi-con-look-like-a-post-nine-worlds-roundtable/9w/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/9w.jpeg?fit=259%2C194&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="259,194" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="9w" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/9w.jpeg?fit=259%2C194&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/9w.jpeg?fit=259%2C194&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/9w-150x150.jpeg?resize=150%2C150" alt="9w" width="150" height="150" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-14010" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><strong>Stephen B:</strong> &#8220;I first noticed how unusually inclusive <a href="https://nineworlds.co.uk/" target="_blank">Nine Worlds</a> was about two minutes after collecting my badge from the front desk. Wandering down the corridor I found myself in&#8230; a <a href="https://nineworlds.co.uk/track/geek-feminism" target="_blank">geek feminism</a> session. </p>
<p>&#8220;I was greeted cheerfully and given a quick intro to what was going on, and then left to join the various groups sitting around the (very popular) room at tables and in small lively seated circles on the floor. The crowd in this room didn’t know my views or that I write for BadRep, and I’m a straight white male &#8211; generally not a famously marginalised group &#8211; but I felt immediately welcome. </p>
<p>&#8220;In the next room along, Bronies were playing guitar and handing out cupcakes. They also had a rave DJ. In that moment, I suspected this wasn’t going to be a typical SF convention.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Safe space?</h2>
<p><strong>Viktoriya:</strong> &#8220;I went to Nine Worlds and I wasn&#8217;t groped, harassed, belittled or condescended to. I felt comfortable enough to walk around dressed in my own clothes, and not necessarily the elaborate armour of ballgowns, cosplay or similar I&#8217;d adopted when frequenting prior conventions. </p>
<p>&#8220;More to the point, I felt comfortable enough to go around ON MY OWN. I can&#8217;t stress this enough. I stopped going to conventions because it had become apparent to me that I was paying a great deal of money to attend an event where it was pretty much guaranteed that I would be assaulted in some way, whereas daily assault is something most women can have for free simply by walking down the street in London. Why pay for the privilege?&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Not being groped, forcibly intoxicated, called a cocktease, an uppity feminist, a silly little girl, or asked to kiss someone for the amusement of male onlookers – it was like a whole new world.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Also, I managed to convince my work friend to come with me to Nine Worlds. You guys, you have no idea of the stress associated with this. </p>
<p>&#8220;What if someone was a dick to her? What if she was assaulted? What if she hated it? Then I would be the work friend who convinced her to spend money on the the thing that was dreadful. </p>
<p>&#8220;So not being groped, forcibly intoxicated, called a cocktease, an uppity feminist, a silly little girl, or asked to kiss someone for the amusement of male onlookers &#8211; it was like a whole new world.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Stephen:</strong> &#8220;It seems that every big convention recently has had a wave of harassment and bad experiences for some attendees. NineWorlds appeared to do things right instead, with a kick-ass <A href= https://nineworlds.co.uk/anti-harassment-policy >anti-harassment policy</a> and some seriously great content.&#8221;</p>

I spent pretty much the whole run-up panicking and convinced my everything would be a huge disaster&#8230;. right up until the second session where my longtime frenemy &#8211; author <a href="https://nineworlds.co.uk/guest/hannah-eiseman-renyard" target="_blank"><strong>Chris Farnell</strong></a> &#8211; gave a talk on &#8216;<a href="https://nineworlds.co.uk/track/news/2013/08/02/working-time-machine-writing-time-travel-so-it-makes-sense" target="_blank">Working the Time Machine: writing time travel so it makes sense&#8217;</a>. </p>
<p>&#8220;We had a packed out room, with people hanging out the doors. Then, as the crowds left and I patted Chris and myself on the back, starting to believe this whole thing might work &#8211; this toy car, sent by the Bronies (pictured) whirred through the door full of cupcakes.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Fandom and atmosphere</h2>
<p><strong>Stephen: </strong>&#8220;Nine Worlds is set up to include a wide range of fandoms and geekery, and all the different fans are welcome in the same space. There was <em>so much</em> going on, I barely saw the other Team BadRep folks.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t just &#8216;here&#8217;s the gay corner&#8217;, so it felt much more open to (say) the B and the T and the Q of &#8216;LGBTQ*&#8217;. Which &#8211; as a bi girl &#8211; I found very, very refreshing.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Hannah:</strong> &#8220;I didn&#8217;t get out to as much of the rest of the fest as you two, but the main thing which spilled across every room, hallway, lobby, breakfast bar and so on was the extremely friendly and welcoming nature of the whole conference. </p>
<p>&#8220;The only other geek con I&#8217;ve been to was the SFX weekender, which wasn&#8217;t <em>unfriendly </em>, but I also can&#8217;t remember half as much mingling (or half as many reasons to mingle) as there were here.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Stephen:</strong> &#8220;I’m not a convention-goer. The friendly atmosphere and lack of judging at Nine Worlds was the kind of pleasant, safe space I’d assume any good con would try for, but from everything I’ve heard in recent years this one got it unusually right. </p>
<p>&#8220;I saw tweets from people saying that having dedicated LGBTQ* content made such a difference to their time there. Even the Bronies didn’t seem to get the usual derision, mostly because they were just unrelentingly happy and frequently gave you cake.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Faves?</h2>
<p><strong>Hannah:</strong> The two standout workshops for me, personally, were fantasy novelist <a href="http://tompollock.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Tom Pollock&#8217;s</strong></a> creative writing workshop on Making Monsters &#8211; which generated at least one idea I&#8217;m going to be writing into a short story. </p>
<p>&#8220;Also, <a href="http://www.enewman.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>Emma Newman</strong></a> ran a workshop on &#8216;Fear and Writing&#8217; &#8211; drawing on <a href="http://www.enewman.co.uk/writing/the-writers-rutter/when-just-write-is-not-enough" target="_blank">her own experiences as an author</a>. </p>
<p>&#8220;Two takeaway things for me were her describing procrastination as a fear-based behaviour, and<br />
that perfectionism is fear&#8217;s favourite coat. Emma &#8211; thank you. That stuff really spoke to me. Like, more than my shrink does.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Hannah:</strong> &#8220;And since it wasn&#8217;t &#8216;here&#8217;s the gay corner&#8217; it felt much more open to (say) the B and the T and the Q sections. Which &#8211; as a bi girl &#8211; I found very, very refreshing.&#8221; </p>
<p><strong>Stephen:</strong> &#8220;On the Friday night I went to a swordfighting workshop with Miltos Yerolemou, the actor who played Syrio Forel in <strong>Game of Thrones</strong>. </p>
<p>&#8220;It was a <em>lot</em> of fun, and at least two thirds of the attendees were women (one of whom was you, Viktoriya, and I totally clocked your expression of demonic glee when you got to swing a very large wooden sword, which suggested you enjoyed the session!).&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Viktoriya:</strong> &#8220;I loved that there was a knitting track, and a <strong>My Little Pony</strong> track, and a board games track. It stressed the diversity of interests that are brought together under the fandom and geek umbrellas in a way that cannot be present in any single-show or single-theme convention. </p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that the &#8216;celebrity guests&#8217; were actually there for panels, activities and workshops primarily, with singing autographs very much a secondary activity, was even better. I despair of the autograph factories modern conventions have become. Queueing for eight hours is not my idea of fun.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Could-do-betters?</h2>
<p><strong>Viktoriya:</strong> &#8220;Well, OK, let me argue with myself for a little bit. I&#8217;m going to nitpick here, not out of anger but because the organisers have shown a genuine interest in learning from their mistakes and in improving the experience in coming years.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, accessibility. I don&#8217;t know what the experience was for those attendees with limited mobility, but I am relatively able-bodied and even I found it a bit cumbersome navigating the stairs in two hotels with only the few lifts. </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Ultimately, that’s what I’m looking for in a convention: committing to doing better next time when mistakes are made.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Some of the multimedia was a little difficult to engage with without risking pain &#8211; strobe lighting, very loud soundscape, and so on. </p>
<p>&#8220;Bringing in a general warning system (a sign on the door?) of strobe lighting for those affected by it, and doing a soundcheck before launching the sound and leaving it at whatever level, would be good.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Stephen:</strong> &#8220;I went to the board games hotel only briefly, and there were lots of steep stairs, but then that&#8217;s the one used for loads of much bigger cons, so I&#8217;m sure they must have a solution in place?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Viktoriya:</strong> &#8220;Well, big cons tend to have a like it or lump it policy. They have priority queuing for fans with mobility issues, but that&#8217;s about it as far as I&#8217;m aware. Individual cons may have a better provision, but I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then there&#8217;s the issue of diversity in organisers and session leads. Part of this is maybe due to the fact that it was the first Nine Worlds, but the organisers, session leads and attendees were overwhelmingly white. </p>
<p>&#8220;Take the panel on <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2013/nineworlds/scmcwd/" target="_blank">Problematic Issues</a> &#8211; some odd things were said during this sessions, and it was also an entirely white panel (so discussing representations of race was rather awkward). I think it was trying to cover too many fandom issues: racism in fanfic and fandom, fetishing gay sex, writing male characters and ignoring female ones, reaffirming heteronormative norms, etc. In an hour.</p>
<p>&#8220;Contrast this with the <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2013/nineworlds/scmdgy/ " target="_blank">Racefail 101 panel</a> in the Books track, which brought together awesome writers of colour to focus on writing characters of colour, and seeking out writers of colour.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given the number of tracks and the number of organisers required, I&#8217;d suggest that the lead organisers work on diversifying the track leads.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;With accessibility, big cons tend to have a like-it-or-lump-it policy. They have priority queuing for fans with mobility issues, but often that’s about it.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p> &#8220;Finally, I disagree with Steve on the inclusiveness extended to the Bronies, mostly because in the sessions I was present at, they were frequently the butt of the joke. </p>
<p>&#8220;Fundamentally, I think it&#8217;s uncool to include something as a track (and therefore give implicit approval of its existence) and then spend the weekend being a bit weirded out by it. I don&#8217;t claim to be part of the MLP fandom, but I thought it was a bit harsh.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Stephen:</strong> &#8220;I didn&#8217;t see the panels where Bronies were mocked, but I did see a lot of people commenting out loud that this was their first experience of them and they thought Bronies were awesome.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Viktoriya:</strong> &#8220;I wonder if part of it isn&#8217;t a reflexive &#8216;let&#8217;s build a hierarchy&#8217; instinct. Certainly there was that feeling at times at the fanfic panels, and some of the comments re: board gaming from attendees. The Bronies were the only ones where I heard panellists commenting on it, though, and there is <a href="http://mechanicalhamster.wordpress.com/2013/08/12/a-great-geekend-part-1-friday/#more-906" target="_blank">some evidence that attendees felt a bit singled out</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What I do think is great is that the organisers of the Problematic Issues panel realised what had gone wrong, and have <a href="http://ladymoonray.livejournal.com/875717.html" target="_blank">publically acknowledged it</a> and committed to doing better next time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ultimately, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m looking for in a convention. There were a few tweeted mentions of positive and negative feedback (which, to their credit, the Nine Worlds twitter feed retweeted).&#8221;</p>
<h2>Let&#8217;s wrap this up&#8230;</h2>
<p><strong>Hannah:</strong> &#8220;I think everyone involved understands it was a first attempt at a huge thing and the learning curve was, and will continue to be, pretty damn steep – but I couldn’t be prouder to be a part of it or more excited about next year.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Viktoriya:</strong> &#8220;Since there&#8217;s a year until the next Nine Worlds I guess I&#8217;ll conclude with some general links on the inclusion and harassment issues &#8211; if you&#8217;re thinking of going to a convention and are concerned about safety, or if you have been harassed at a convention and want to know how to report it, have a look at these resources:</p>
<ul>
<li>Elise Mathesen&#8217;s experience of reporting sexual harassment <a href="http://seanan-mcguire.livejournal.com/517984.html" target="_blank">here</a>, including a contact and resource list for reporting it <a href="http://www.jimchines.com/2013/07/reporting-sexual-harassment-2013/" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
<li>Carrie Cuinn&#8217;s experiences and guide for reporting are <a href="http://carriecuinn.com/2013/06/30/please-stop-touching-my-breasts-and-other-things-i-say-at-cons/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://carriecuinn.com/2013/07/02/sexual-harassment-at-cons-part-2-how-to-stop-it-and-other-thoughts/" target="_blank">here</a> </li>
<li>Finally, the odious Ted Beale was recently finally expelled from <a href="http://www.locusmag.com/News/2013/08/beale-expelled-from-sfwa/" target="_blank">SFWA</a>. NK Jemisin has written <a href="http://nkjemisin.com/2013/08/time-to-pick-a-side/" target="_blank">a blisteringy on-point post</a> on racism and misogyny in SFF, Beale&#8217;s expulsion, and the behaviour which led to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;Most of all, I loved the fact that I enjoyed Nine Worlds so much, I have already decided I&#8217;m going next year. No uncertainty, no hmm-maybe and oh-yes-perhaps. I&#8217;m going next year because it was wonderful. How can you argue with that?&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[When I mentioned my abhorrence of the casual connections being made by vegan activists between rape and the dairy industry on Twitter, a vegan pal asked “What else would you call it?”]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li><em>First things first: there&#8217;s a trigger warning on this post for discussion of (and links to discussion of) sexual assault, racism, homophobia, transphobia and generally insultingly bad advertising &#8211; take care when clicking the links. We haven&#8217;t included any images which depict these things below, but we have used some viral text-based images which reference them.</em></li>
<li><em>This is another guest post from the lovely <a href="https://twitter.com/smokintofu" target="_blank"><strong>Alice Slater</strong></a> (we&#8217;re thinking of adopting her permanently if we can persuade her&#8230;). If you&#8217;ve got a guest post brewing in your brain, drop us a line and send a pitch to <a href="mailto:badrepeditors@gmail.com"><strong>badrepeditors@gmail.com</strong></a>.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone approaches veganism from a different angle.</p>
<p>Some vegans find their way into it through kindness and empathy for living creatures; others are swayed by hard facts and shocking images. Neither is more or less agreeable, and I suspect that in our day-to-day lives, most vegans use a combination of both when faced with questions from curious veggie or omni friends.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/veg1.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="13657" data-permalink="/2013/05/27/guest-post-veganism-ble-at-and-rape-culture/veg1/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/veg1.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="300,200" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="veg1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/veg1.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/veg1.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-13657" alt="veg1" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/veg1.jpg?resize=300%2C200" width="300" height="200" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>But then there’s People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, or PETA as they&#8217;re commonly known. PETA’s ongoing <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/08/13/national/main777016.shtml" target="_blank">racist</a>, <a href="http://www.womanist-musings.com/2008/09/peta-favourite-animal-is-pussy.html" target="_blank">misogynistic</a>, <a href="http://www.womanist-musings.com/2009/02/peta-goes-lesbian.html" target="_blank">homophobic</a>, <a href="http://thecolonic.blogspot.co.uk/2009/02/using-transphobia-to-fight-animal-abuse.html" target="_blank">transphobic</a> and <a href="http://media.treehugger.com/assets/images/2011/10/peta-save-whales-billboard.jpg" target="_blank">fat-shaming</a> ads and publicity stunts are frequently ripped to pieces online. </p>
<p>Plenty of <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20110911113310AANAUWZ" target="_blank">veg*ns</a> dislike PETA’s controversial tactics, yet many agree that at least their attention-seeking techniques shine a light on the fight and get results, regardless of the harm they cause to others in the process.</p>
<p>PETA are a massive organisation, and they spread a very clear message: animals are not ours to eat, wear, experiment on or use for entertainment – but we’ll appropriate the Holocaust (see below), slavery, women’s bodies, homosexuality and trans* stereotypes to further our cause &#8211; and we don’t give a hoot what oppression we’re supporting in the process.</p>

<p>PETA aren’t the only platform for animal rights, though. Vegans rejoiced a few weeks ago when the beta version of <a href="http://ble.at/" target="_blank"><strong>Ble.at</strong></a> finally went live. For you carnivores not in the loop, Ble.at is a social network for vegans to exchange recipes, activist resources, articles, images and videos. </p>
<p>It’s similar to Tumblr and Twitter insofar as the primary purpose is to upload original content that can then be reblogged (“rebleated”) by fellow vegans. It’s a great way for vegans to connect on a micro level, by spreading awareness of local causes and events, and on a macro level by communicating with vegans on a global scale.</p>
<p>For the first week, it was mostly gifs of piglets, infographics of banana ice cream recipes, and cartoon avocados. With 5,500 profiles created within seven days of the site’s launch, the content rapidly improved: awesome recipes, powerful pro-vegan ads, witty one-liners and inspirational quotes promoting veganism were rife. But unfortunately, so was rape culture.</p>
<p>Due to the reblogging nature of the site, the same images kept popping into my feed: an illustration of an angry cow squeezing the bare breast of a lactating woman, a cartoon of a robot raping a blood-covered cow<sup><a href="/2013/05/27/guest-post-veganism-ble-at-and-rape-culture/#footnote_0_13647" id="identifier_0_13647" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" Ed&rsquo;s Tiny Note: We&rsquo;ve not linked these two as they really are truly unpleasant. They&rsquo;re definitely real, though. ">1</a></sup>, milk being referred to as “rape juice” and the comparison between enjoying the taste of meat to the sexual pleasure a rapist experiences (below right). </p>
<p>Most shocking of all was a video entitled <a href="http://ble.at/videos/597/women-forcefully-milked-in-the-street-269life-animal-rights-performance" target="_blank">“Women forcefully milked in the street”</a>. The short film documents a provocative street performance in which a lactating mother has her baby snatched from her arms by masked men with bloodied hands, who then tear open her blouse to reveal her bare breasts. The rest of the content is in the title. It’s absolutely horrific to watch.</p>

<p>When I mentioned my abhorrence of the casual connection between rape and the dairy industry on Twitter, a vegan pal asked, “What else would you call it?”</p>
<p>Well, the industry term for the bench on which female cows are artificially inseminated is often the “rape rack”, so referring to the process as rape isn’t a particular stretch. But the very fact that this is a common term within the dairy industry is a product of rape culture.</p>
<p>The pig factory employee found forcing metal rods and electrodes into the vaginas of sows is a product of rape culture. The flagrant disregard for the mental health of survivors by flaunting these triggering images to promote veganism is a product of rape culture.</p>
<p>By comparing the industrialised rape and infanticide of the dairy industry to the rape and infanticide of women and children, we are asking non-vegans to project the empathy for the latter onto the suffering of the former. The problem with comparing the dairy industry to rape is that we still live in a rape culture.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we live in a world in which a teenage girl is gang-raped, photographed unconscious by her aggressors <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/national/2013/03/steubenville-rape-twitter-cnn/63349/" target="_blank">and is still blamed</a>. We live in a world in which an accused rapist&#8217;s conviction is overturned because his disabled alleged victim <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/04/richard-fourtin-case-supreme-court-accused-rapist-sexual-assault-handicapped-victim_n_1937528.html" target="_blank">did not resist the attack</a>. We live in a world in which women are threatened with rape on a daily basis and are expected to laugh when comedians <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/07/11/why-daniel-tosh-s-rape-joke-at-the-laugh-factory-wasn-t-funny.html" target="_blank">crack rape jokes</a>. We don’t live in a world that cares enough about the rape of humans for the comparison to be truly effective.</p>
<p>By spreading these images of women being assaulted, we are supporting rape culture, and we are appropriating the suffering and strength of survivors. It is unacceptable to hijack, trigger and traumatise to forward a cause that has so many other convincing arguments to sway potential vegans into ditching the dairy.</p>
<p>Do we really want to be part of a movement that, like PETA, pushes animal rights forward with one hand and shoves civil rights, women’s liberation, LGBTQI rights, issues of race and body positivism aside with the other? That is not my veganism.</p>
<p>To paraphrase <a href="http://tigerbeatdown.com/2011/10/10/my-feminism-will-be-intersectional-or-it-will-be-bullshit/" target="_blank">Flavia Dzodan</a>, my veganism will be intersectional or it will be bullshit. From <a href="http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/29104505" target="_blank">dressing up as the KKK</a> to producing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0vQOnHW0Kc" target="_blank">pro-domestic violence ads</a>, PETA are absolutely rancid, poisonous and unforgivable. It’s also unforgivable to use triggering imagery of women being assaulted to push the vegan agenda.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am supposed to be writing about <strong>Bioshock Infinite</strong> right now (which is amazing and you should all play it right bloody now) but then, something happened.</p>
<p>Something long-awaited, occasionally hoaxed, but nobody was ever entirely sure would ever come to pass&#8230;THE SUN CAME OUT AND SPRING ARRIVED IN THE UK, FINALLY. And also there was the death of 87-year-old Margaret Thatcher of a stroke at the end of a protracted illness.</p>
<p>And lo, the internet did have a field day. Twitter was a maelstrom of popping corks, whitewashing of one of the darkest times post-war Britain has faced, and joyous choruses of <em>that</em> song from The Wizard of Oz, all alongside expressions of disgust for every aspect of the reaction. The 8<sup>th</sup> of April 2013 will go down in Twitter history as a bona fide fustercluck.</p>

<p>The <strong>New Statesman</strong> ran a brief and to-the-point piece about whether or not Thatcher <a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/archive/2013/04/margaret-thatcher-feminist-icon" target="_blank">could or should be considered a feminist icon</a>. In the words of the Iron Lady herself, “I hate feminism. It is poison.”</p>
<p>So far, so cut-and-dry. But her words have been niggling at me somewhat. She&#8217;s not the first woman to denounce and distance herself from feminism. Nor will she be the last. But I cannot help but wonder what would drive a woman who would never have reached her position without feminism to speak out against it with such contempt.</p>
<p>While we can now only speculate on why her personal views were what they were, I&#8217;m reminded of a few arguments I hear with disheartening frequency about why feminism isn&#8217;t needed and why feminists need to shut up.</p>
<p>Spoilers: I am neither moved nor convinced by any of them.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> “<b>I don&#8217;t need feminism. We have the vote. It&#8217;s done. Women are totes equal. Get over it.</b>”</p>
<p>This line of reasoning barely dignifies a response beyond pointing out, somewhat wearily, that it&#8217;s demonstrably untrue. Whether we&#8217;re talking pay gaps, sexual abuse, street harassment, representation in politics, assumptions about childcare arrangements or anything else in an endless list of smaller inequalities adding up to a great big unequal world. Yes, women in the UK have it better than at any point in the past; no, that doesn&#8217;t mean that equality has happened.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> “<b>I&#8217;m just &#8216;one of the lads&#8217; in my social group/place of work. Feminists are trying to drive a wedge between me and the men in my life by making a fuss over nothing.”</b></p>
<p>It is wonderful to be accepted as socially or professionally equal to men. Yet I felt bile rising in my throat as I typed that. Being “one of the lads”, while harmless on the face of it, is an argument that has some rather unpleasant meanings once you place it under scrutiny. It panders directly to the “man, rather than person, as default” rhetoric that pervades almost every corner of our society.</p>
<p>This line of reasoning erases feminine identities and elevates stereotypically masculine traits or interests as something one should aspire to and work towards, something essential for social acceptance. There is internalised misogyny afoot every time a self-proclaimed “ladette” crows about chugging pints of beer, watching a match, ogling boobs or besting her boyfriend at <strong>Modern Warfare 2</strong>. The heavily implied sentiment here is “these are all MAN things and I am more like a MAN for doing them and that puts me above all of you feminists trying to spoil my fun.”</p>
<p>None of these activities are inherently “gendered”, and the fact you behave like they are is sort-of-kind-of-rather undermining those of us genuinely striving for equality.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> “<b>Everybody should be judged on merit. Feminism is trying to give women a leg-up over men and that is unfair!”</b></p>
<p>Yes, the promotion of one group of people over another based on nothing but their attributes at birth is inherently unfair, and no, this is not what the majority of feminists want.</p>
<p>Feminists LIKE men. In fact, plenty of feminists ARE men. Feminism is about reaching equality, or parity, whatever you want to call it. It is a movement against the oppression of hundreds of years. In most fields of employment, and certainly at the highest levels, women are underrepresented. If you really believe that we already exist in a meritocracy, how else could you account for this disparity without the spurious notion that “men are just better at everything, LOL”?</p>
<p>Feminists are not seeking to take anything away from men: they are simply trying to level the still-slanted playing field so that the ball stops rolling into the men&#8217;s goal by default. Sure, it&#8217;s not the vertiginous cliff face it once was, but the angle of elevation still very much favours the dudes. If you want a meritocracy, you have to submit to its conditions. If you believe the only way you can succeed is by ensuring that the oppressive status quo is maintained, then you may need to revisit your understanding of the term “individual merit.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>These are just three of the more common arguments I hear. From women with whom I am friends, it&#8217;s troubling, but can at least be the start of a constructive dialogue. From women in the public eye, however, from politician to pop star, these are toxic messages that reinforce oppression and can thwart the ambitions of girls and women.</p>
<p>The cognitive shift from “Hey, I can do that, and I happen to be a girl!” to “I would like to do that, but I&#8217;m a girl” may sound subtle, but its impact is potentially devastating. The dismissive words of a high-achieving female role model can make all the difference, so it&#8217;s vital that we understand that these women would not be where they are today without feminism and that their public declarations show a fundamental lack of understanding about the ongoing struggle for equality.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I wanted to write not about Thatcher, but about representations of her.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I can&#8217;t write a political or historical retrospective on Thatcher, on her life or her works. If I did, it might come out like <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/apr/09/russell-brand-margaret-thatcher?INTCMP=SRCH" target="_blank">the Russell Brand piece</a>, only a bit more Northern, a bit more reflective on her impact on feminism.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve read and seen far too much already over the past few days, from endless eulogies in the papers through to angry words on the street and in the House of Commons. The truth is I am genuinely shaken by it. Like the Queen Mother, she was one of those figures we all suspected might go on forever, and her shadow was long. With it gone, one of the touchpoints for my personal politics is gone.</p>
<p>I started to think about how I might even begin to parse what has happened: I&#8217;m not sad, but I&#8217;ll admit I didn&#8217;t crack open the champagne personally; I merely drank someone else&#8217;s.So in a similar vein, I wanted to write not about her, but about representations of her.</p>
<h2>Maggie&#8217;s Farm</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m going to start with one of my favourite political cartoonists. Alongside his later portrayal of her puppeteering Tony Blair, comic artist <a href="http://www.belltoons.co.uk/books" target="_blank">Steve Bell</a> also focuses on her controlling authority. He wrote a series called <strong>Maggie&#8217;s Farm</strong> which depicted her as completely insane &#8211; with trademark wonky eye and multiple exclamation points in her speech.</p>
<p>The comics, which reference Dylan&#8217;s song of the same title (which was in itself used as a protest song against Thatcher) were originally published in <strong>Time Out</strong> from 1979, and, to my eye, probably heavily influenced later depictions.</p>
<h2>Spitting Image</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Magaret-Thatcher.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="13515" data-permalink="/2013/04/15/images-of-an-iron-lady/magaret-thatcher/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Magaret-Thatcher.jpg?fit=462%2C353&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="462,353" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Magaret Thatcher" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Magaret-Thatcher.jpg?fit=300%2C229&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Magaret-Thatcher.jpg?fit=462%2C353&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-13515 aligncenter" alt="Spitting Image's version of Thatcher" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Magaret-Thatcher.jpg?resize=370%2C282" width="370" height="282" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>The first time I saw <strong>Spitting Image</strong> I was hooked, probably helped by the fact my parents told me I wasn&#8217;t allowed to watch it, and to this day I regret that it has gone off the air. Perhaps it&#8217;s because no satire is strong enough to be distinguished from the ridiculous facts of today&#8217;s government? Anyway, back to Thatcher.</p>
<p>The depiction of her was grotesque, but no more so than that of any other puppet on the show. That said, it was the <em>nature</em> of the grotesque that interested me.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/jINZBOxdja8" height="360" width="480" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>She was ridiculed for her strength and controlling nature in the form of a horrific headmistress. It&#8217;s interesting to note that later John Major was ridiculed for his <em>lack</em> of strength.</p>
<p>But rather than this being portrayed as an essential part of her it was represented in reference to Thatcher as a woman  (note the ongoing references to her as &#8220;sir&#8221;). Her strength was ridiculed, in part, by presenting it as &#8220;unfeminine&#8221; and therefore funny or dangerous: a stereotype of women in politics that will no doubt take many years to overturn. <a href="http://spittingimage.wikia.com/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher" target="_blank">As the series moved on she became less and less human</a>, eventually turning into an alien monster.</p>

<p>Raymond Briggs delivers a rendition of the Falklands War in a way that is moving, vitriolic, frightening and humbling in his 1984 piece <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tin-Pot_Foreign_General_and_the_Old_Iron_Woman" target="_blank"><strong>The Tin Pot Foreign General and The Old Iron Woman</strong></a>.</p>
<p>What I find particularly interesting here is how her depiction contrasts with that of <strong>Spitting Image</strong>. Both use the &#8220;non-human&#8221; references, but whereas the <strong>Spitting Image</strong> Thatcher is usually either asexual or very masculine, here she is quite the opposite. Guns and victory explosions fire from her breasts as she squats (in high heels, with rounded buttocks and suspenders, no less) over her land and nation in a parody of birth. The conflation of female and war-machine gives rise to a gross, highly sexualised fembot.</p>

<p>I returned from holiday just over a year ago to find London distressingly covered in images of Meryl Streep in <strong>The Iron Lady</strong>, with her icy blue eyes following me all over the place. It haunted me, <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/01/10/on-thatcher-icons-and-iron-ladies-rhian-jones/">in much the same way as it did our Rhian Jones</a> (I&#8217;ll admit it, I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to see the film).</p>
<p>It was the glossiness of the whole thing that threw me, the vogue-ish fashion magazine stylings that worked their hardest to reunite those twin features of &#8220;female&#8221; and &#8220;powerful&#8221; which had created such horrors through both <strong>Spitting Image</strong> and at the pencil of Raymond Briggs. And they succeeded in being very flattering, through a combination of make-up and airbrushing.</p>
<p>Streep is noticeably less wrinkled and more attractively-styled than Thatcher, looking eerily like a better-looking sister. The situation was enhanced by Streep&#8217;s own acting ability, and a script which included scenes of feminine domesticity.</p>
<h2>What next?</h2>
<p>I never knew her. Never met her. I only understood her as a series of images and icons, on the television as a politician and in other representations of her, which are more numerous than I can contain in one article. Buzzfeed, for example, <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/angelameiquan/21-incredibly-angry-songs-about-margaret-thatcher">collected a list of songs about her</a>. Like many other dead, famous people, over time she will fade from a real person, who nonetheless was one of the bogeymen of my childhood (alongside the boggle-faced baddie animals in <a href="http://www.80snostalgia.com/orm-and-cheep/"><strong>Orm and Cheep</strong></a>) to being almost imaginary, an icon.</p>
<p>To me, she will always be the figurehead for all that is wrong with right wing thinking and the sort of &#8220;feminism&#8221; that claims it must be feminist if a woman is doing it. Those with opposing politics have put her on a pedestal. Other people will make her into other things.</p>
<p>I doubt we&#8217;ve seen the last representation, but I&#8217;ll be interested which version of Margaret Thatcher will stand the test of time, and which version we will be faced with next.</p>

<li><em>Here&#8217;s Part 2 of <a href="http://www.rarelywearslipstick.com">Rarely Wears Lipstick</a> founder and blogger <strong>Lori Smith</strong>&#8216;s guest post two-parter (which is possibly mildly NSFW depending on how relaxed your workplace is!) <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2013/03/26/guest-post-lingerie-women-and-eroticism-a-brief-study-of-the-21st-century-agent-provocateur-woman-part-12/">Read Part 1 here</a>.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>Part 2: The Myth of the Agent Provocateur Woman</h2>
<p>If it is understood that the dominant discourse still pertains to heterosexual and patriarchal ideologies, Agent Provocateur was certainly aiming to challenge this in 2008. The brochure for their Spring/Summer collection that year contains many examples of non-heteronormative behaviour.</p>
<p>A model in a swimming costume and stilettos <a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AP2.jpg?resize=547%2C410" target="_blank">stands in front of a seated, similarly attired woman</a>, who touches her leg and looks up to her. Two women in satin lingerie and high heels are seen walking together – one has her hand on the other’s buttocks. A woman in animal print lingerie brandishes a spanking paddle and leans over an anonymous prostrate naked woman, whilst holding a rope that is attached to the submissive woman’s neck like a leash. An anonymous red-haired woman straddles a seated gasping woman whose arm is being stroked by a blonde in lingerie, brandishing a riding crop. Another woman, who is standing with her legs apart and her hands on her hips, watches an athletic female pole dancer. A topless woman in a red wig climbs on top of a woman in lingerie who lies, restrained, on a table.</p>
<p>There are also many examples of dominant female behaviour. Two women in bright coloured wigs and lingerie tie up and blindfold a clothed man on his knees. A man in underwear stands, with hands tied behind his back, displaying marks on his chest that suggest he has been struck by the riding crop held by the woman to his left. A handcuffed man is disrobed by a woman, whilst another woman records the scene using a professional video camera. A man lying restrained on a table, has his trousers unzipped by a lingerie-clad woman who is holding a glass of brandy and is staring directly at the viewer.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AP4.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="13398" data-permalink="/2013/03/26/guest-post-lingerie-women-and-eroticism-a-brief-study-of-the-21st-century-agent-provocateur-woman-part-12/ap4/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AP4.jpg?fit=640%2C480&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="640,480" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="AP4" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AP4.jpg?fit=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AP4.jpg?fit=640%2C480&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13398" alt="AP4" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AP4.jpg?resize=540%2C380" width="540" height="380" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>In this image, the Agent Provocateur woman is powerful yet playful. She is passionate, determined to satisfy her own desires and, from the facial expressions depicted, is clearly enjoying herself. She is active, not passive, and has agency.</p>
<p>However, in the 2012 brochure, the Agent Provocateur woman appears to have little or no agency. She faces the camera as if directed to by the photographer and is entirely the subject of the gaze – continually watching herself. This appears to be a return to the woman John Berger describes in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ways_of_Seeing" target="_blank"><strong>Ways of Seeing</strong></a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>She has to survey everything she is and everything she does because how she appears to others, and ultimately how she appears to men, is of crucial importance for what is normally thought of as the success of her life.</p></blockquote>
<p>There is little or no resistance to dominant discourses in the images contained within this brochure. All of the women appear sexually available, but are inviting sex rather than pursuing it. A woman stands in lingerie and heels next to a similarly attired seated woman, both facing the viewer with their legs apart. A woman kneels on a velvet chair, glancing over her shoulder at the viewer, with her buttocks prominently displayed. A woman in lingerie reclines on a chaise longue. A seated woman with her legs apart, hand on hip, stares at the viewer. There is no interaction between these women, even when more than one appears in the same image. Their only purpose is to invite the viewer’s gaze.</p>

<p><a href="http://joc.sagepub.com/content/6/2/177.abstract" target="_blank">Christian Jantzen and others</a> conducted a series of interviews with white middle class women in Denmark. The results suggested that these women wear delicate lingerie in order to achieve a sensation rather than a look. They wear it for how it makes them feel – confident, sensual, happy and satisfied – not necessarily for how they will be perceived by their partner. Some of the interviewees even admitted that the men in their lives do not understand their desire for exquisite lingerie. For them, the purchase and wearing of beautiful expensive underwear is about much more than just sex. It is about identity, pleasure, knowing how to dress for the right occasion, and, occasionally, projecting a desired alternate self-image:</p>
<blockquote><p>The importance of lingerie to most of our respondents is due to the fact that this kind of garment enables them to demonstrate that they can manage a modern femininity. By adhering to a certain scheme of classification, they show how they master their performance in different situations. This confirms their <em>social self</em>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Their research suggests that presenting lingerie as something to be enjoyed by the viewer rather than the wearer would not appeal to women. Even if this is not always true of women outside of their small study sample, I would argue that the current representation of the Agent Provocateur woman would therefore not appeal to the customer the brand originally sought to attract.</p>
<p>To conclude, the Agent Provocateur woman’s identity is, like the identity of every woman, shaped by discourse and the ideologies she is exposed to. If the woman is surrounded by, and part of, discourse which challenges what is currently dominant, she will herself become part of a reverse discourse. Agent Provocateur was originally conceived by Corré and Rees as a celebration of femininity, and the initial representation of the Agent Provocateur woman emphasised the performativity of her gender and her rejection of the patriarchal ideologies so often present in lingerie advertising.</p>
<p>Although the association between Agent Provocateur lingerie and this playfully erotic yet not passive lifestyle is purely arbitrary, it was exceedingly easy for customers to see the brand’s values and decide whether or not they wished to adopt them. Through the act of putting on this particular brand of quality exotic lingerie, a customer would create her sense of self, create her gender and transform her life into that of the Agent Provocateur woman. All of this was successfully conveyed in the promotional images and advertising for the brand up until at least 2008.</p>
<p>In looking at the differences between the images used to promote the Spring/Summer 2008 collection and those of the Autumn/Winter 2012 collection, it could be argued that the sale of the brand to a multinational company had an effect on how the Agent Provocateur woman was represented. The brand’s ideal woman appears to now offer far less resistance to current discourses on gender, sexuality and femininity than she did when Corré and Rees first sought to use lingerie as a way to disrupt and question the fashion status quo.</p>
<p>In expanding the market for the brand, the new owners appear to be attempting to create erotic lingerie that does not offend, thus diluting the original ethos of Agent Provocateur. Perhaps it is the current discourse which has changed, or maybe the Agent Provocateur woman simply works with the current discourse rather than against it? However, it could also be claimed that what is considered to be erotic is entirely subjective.</p>

<li><em>Having had an awesome time at the <a href="http://www.rarelywearslipstick.com/2013/03/rwl-awards-the-winners/" target="_blank">Rarely Wears Lipstick Awards</a>, in which we were nominated for Best Feminist Blog (and congrats to <a href="http://stavvers.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Stavvers</a>, the fabulous winner!) we are very happy to have RWL founder and blogger <strong>Lori Smith</strong> back to BadRep Towers for a two-parter (which is possibly NSFW depending on how relaxed your workplace is! Maybe skip the vid)&#8230;</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>Part 1: Agent Provocateur, Discourse and Performativity</h2>
<p>In 1971, Vivienne Westwood and Malcolm McLaren set up ‘Let it Rock’, their first King’s Road boutique. Their son Joseph Corré followed in his parents’ footsteps and opened a shop in London with his wife Serena Rees in 1994. Named <a href="http://www.agentprovocateur.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Agent Provocateur</strong></a>, the unusual boutique bridged a gap between the erotic lingerie sold in Soho’s sex shops and the respectable prettiness of the established quality brands sold in department stores.</p>
<p>Corré and Rees saw the brand as a vehicle for their creativity and their ideas about women and femininity. In 1995, they began a search for a woman who ‘would represent the concepts behind the clothes, model new designs, and be a spokesperson at upcoming events’. They saw the face of their brand as ‘charming, glamorous, curvy, independent and intelligent’ (see <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Agent-Provocateur-Celebration-Femininity-Sexuality/dp/1858687586" target="_blank"><strong>Agent Provocateur: A Celebration of Femininity</strong></a>).</p>
<p>The finalists of their competition were used as part of a publicity stunt at London Fashion Week, staging a demonstration against bland passionless fashion that drew the attention of the assembled press. After a decadent Miss Agent Provocateur Party had been held, where the winner was announced, Corré and Rees realised that a single woman couldn’t represent their brand’s values as the concept was too diverse. Every woman has the potential to become an agent provocateur.<br />

<p>Corré and Rees have since divorced, and in 2007, Agent Provocateur was purchased by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3i" target="_blank">3i Group</a>. This gradually led to a significant change in how the Agent Provocateur woman was represented in the brand’s advertising campaigns. The brochure to showcase the Spring/Summer 2008 collection retained a lot of the ethos of Corré and Rees’ original vision. It has a cover designed to look like an invitation to an exclusive party, featuring the text ‘you are cordially invited to attend a very private affair […] Bring a blindfold and an open mind!’. Each image inside forms part of a digitally-created montage, with the pages containing small parts of the panoramic whole, unfolding to reveal one uninterrupted tableau.</p>

<p>The models are depicted as attendees of the party and are engaging in activities of a sexual nature. Nothing pornographic is depicted, merely hints of erotic and light BDSM play. Most of the party guests are women, clothed in Agent Provocateur lingerie and swimwear, but there are also a number of men in the image. The women take both dominant and submissive roles, whilst the men are purely submissive.</p>

<p>Product information about the lingerie sets featured, such as name and price, is listed on the back of the image. With this choice of layout, it could be argued that the images are designed to be enjoyed first, and to be informative second.</p>

<p>By contrast, the Autumn/Winter 2012 collection is presented in a brochure containing separate images for each named set of lingerie, with the product details directly underneath each photograph. The theme of the collection is ‘Wilhelmina: Show Your True Self’ and the associated campaign focuses on a woman in Victorian London whose inner sensuality is revealed by a backstreet photographer’s magical camera.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/7DY728GDWI0" height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Each image contains between one and three female models, with little or no interaction between them. The women are not engaged in any activity other than modelling the clothing for the viewer, and are, as such, passive subjects of the gaze. Hair and make up is consistent throughout and maintains the look of a catwalk show, where the models are presented as a homogenous entity – a representation of how the brand’s woman should physically embody that season’s look.</p>

<p>Each model’s &#8216;true self&#8217; appears to be no different from the others. This presents us with a single type of Agent Provocateur woman, as opposed to the idea that she is present in all women, as Corré envisioned seventeen years previously.</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AP12.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="13419" data-permalink="/2013/03/26/guest-post-lingerie-women-and-eroticism-a-brief-study-of-the-21st-century-agent-provocateur-woman-part-12/ap12/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AP12.jpg?fit=912%2C684&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="912,684" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="AP12" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AP12.jpg?fit=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AP12.jpg?fit=912%2C684&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-13419" alt="AP12" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AP12.jpg?resize=517%2C388" width="517" height="388" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>It has often been suggested that the female body in lingerie is more erotic than the nude female body. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_Barthes" target="_blank">Roland Barthes</a> touches on this in his essay on striptease, published in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythologies_(book)" target="_blank"><strong>Mythologies</strong></a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Woman is desexualized at the very moment when she is stripped naked. We may therefore say that we are dealing in a sense with a spectacle based on fear, or rather on the pretence of fear, as if eroticism here went no further than a sort of delicious terror, whose ritual signs have only to be announced to evoke at once the idea of sex and its conjuration.</p></blockquote>
<p>At the very heart of the original concept of the Agent Provocateur brand, when it was founded by Corré and Rees, was the idea of lingerie as a ritual sign which evoked the idea of sex. Although they sought to design underwear which referenced socially acceptable quality French lingerie, eroticism was very much a part of Agent Provocateur’s core values. They made the brand accessible to women who would not normally venture into sex shops to purchase erotic lingerie.</p>
<p>It could be argued that Corré and Rees were also responding to dominant discourse on sexuality and gender when they set up Agent Provocateur in the 1990s. In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_History_of_Sexuality#Volume_I:_The_Will_to_Knowledge" target="_blank"><strong>The History of Sexuality Volume 1</strong></a>, Michel Foucault analyses changes in discourse on sexuality and argues that discourse is a productive force; for example, leading to definitions of “normal” and “other”. He also looks at the concept of docile bodies versus active agency, discussing reverse discourse as an empowering method of countering the dominant discourse.</p>
<p>There is little doubt that Agent Provocateur – whose name refers to an undercover agent employed to provoke suspects to commit illegal punishable acts – originally sought to engage in a reverse discourse on female sexuality. In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_History_of_Sexuality#Part_II:_The_Repressive_Hypothesis" target="_blank"><strong>The History of Sexuality Volume 2</strong></a>, Foucault delves further and discusses what he calls ‘techniques of the self’, emphasising the role of practices and instruments in generating a sense of self.</p>
<p>Clothing is very much a ‘technique of the self’. People use their clothes to transform, change and project a chosen image on a daily basis. Although society still often restricts the individual’s choice of outerwear, <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/12/19/found-feminism-agent-provocateur-the-chase/" target="_blank">unseen underwear</a> offers the wearer a sense of agency. Lingerie is considered by many to be an instrument in generating a sense of self, and it is worth considering here that the self is also shaped by gender.</p>
<p>It is widely understood that gender is a cultural construction that is shaped by discursive forces. One of the main issues considered by Judith Butler is the performativity of gender. Gender is not a performance – as that suggests the performer returns to a more genuine self once they leave the stage – but it is performative, as we are all constantly putting on an act. Lingerie is but one aspect of the act of femininity.</p>
<blockquote><p>Because there is neither an “essence” that gender expresses or externalizes nor an objective ideal to which gender aspires, and because gender is not a fact, the various acts of gender create the idea of gender, and without those acts, there would be no gender at all.</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>Judith Butler</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Therefore, what could possibly be more “womanly” than dressing oneself up in Agent Provocateur lingerie? In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_Trouble" target="_blank"><strong>Gender Trouble</strong></a>, Butler explores the spaces of resistance to dominant discourses. Like Foucault, and with reference to his work, she asks how we can go beyond the boundaries imposed on us by discourse, and explores the concept of agency. Gender and identity are more of a “doing” than a “becoming”, and are constantly shaped by discourse. Like any woman, the Agent Provocateur woman’s identity is fluid. She is constantly made and remade by the forces around her.</p>

<li><em><strong>Rabalias</strong> of RPG-gaming blogging collective <a href="http://blackarmada.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Black Armada</strong></a> sent us this post, together with a petition.

<p><strong>Dungeons and Dragons (D&amp;D)</strong> is the single most famous roleplaying game in the world, the route most people got into roleplaying, and the flagship of the hobby. So it&#8217;s a tragedy that the game is pushing away potential fans through artwork and even game text that is overwhelmingly focused on one customer demographic: white men.</p>

<p>That’s a pretty provocative statement, right there. But I’m confident in making it, because the evidence is there for anyone who wants to see it. You could start by flipping open a copy of pretty much any D&amp;D book and looking through the artwork. See how many women and people of colour you can find – and then see how many of them are half-dressed or made to look weak or submissive.</p>
<p>Actually, you don’t need to, because someone already did it for you. Anna Kreider <a href="http://www.pelgranepress.com/?p=3501" target="_blank">reviewed the artwork in the D&amp;D 4th edition</a> books (specifically the <strong>Dungeon Master’s Guide</strong>, <strong>Players Handbook</strong>, <strong>Players Handbook 2</strong> and the <strong>Adventurer’s Vault</strong>) and rated the images therein.</p>
<p>Kreider’s findings were striking – of the 40% or so of humans (and demi-humans) that were depicted as female, well over a third hit each of the measures she chose (being half-dressed or posed in a sexually suggestive way, for instance). Needless to say, the remaining 60% of images, the ones which were of men, tended to be wearing more clothes, in more active, non-sexual poses.</p>
<p>It gets better, because Chris Van Dyke <a href="http://raceindnd.wordpress.com/2008/11/18/nerd-nite-presentation-november-18th-2008/" target="_blank">had a look at D&amp;D from the perspective of race</a>. He was able to find only two examples of a non-white character in the core books of all four numbered editions of D&amp;D. That means non-white folks are practically invisible in D&amp;D.</p>
<p>Now, these findings are based on subjective judgements. That’s unavoidable, because things like “sexually suggestive” and “white” can often only be judged subjectively in artwork. You can go and judge for yourself if you doubt their conclusions. But I think if we’re honest, these results only confirm what most of us already knew from experience.</p>
<p>It isn’t the end of the world. I’ve enjoyed lots of pop culture replete with sexism. And after all, it’s only a fantasy! But then again, shouldn’t our fantasy worlds contain a richer variety of creatures than real life? And what does it say to potential new gamers if they can’t find a picture of someone like them anywhere in these books? Is D&amp;D really just a game about white dudes slugging it out in a dungeon somewhere? I don’t think so.</p>
<p>OK, so what to do about it? I love roleplaying, and despite years of moaning about the mechanics, I still love D&amp;D. The fact that it’s not exactly a beacon of gender and racial equality is, for me, an obstacle to be overcome rather than a sign I should give up on the game altogether.</p>
<p>It so happens that <a href="http://www.wizards.com" target="_blank">Wizards of the Coast</a> are writing a new edition of D&amp;D right now. That’s why I put together <a href="http://www.thepetitionsite.com/522/618/587/dd-should-be-for-everyone-not-just-white-men/" target="_blank">a petition calling on them to do better</a>.</p>
<p>If you’ve read this far, maybe you agree with me – and if so, it would be great if you went and <a href="http://www.thepetitionsite.com/522/618/587/dd-should-be-for-everyone-not-just-white-men/" target="_blank">signed it</a>, and better yet share it with your friends and encourage them to sign too.</p>
<p>The petition won’t change anything in itself. Wizards of the Coast could ignore it, and maybe they will. But if they can see that there are hundreds of gamers out there who want more than whitewash and chainmail bikinis, maybe they’ll respond. We owe it to the hobby to give them a clear message.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[This isn't really a post about lambasting the ASDA advert - many people have done that, and more eloquently too. What it is about is advertisers' perception of who we are as people.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s currently an ASDA advert doing the rounds of various websites (and the TV, I imagine, given that&#8217;s where adverts also exist) which has earned the ire of various commentators, including the <a href="http://www.mumsnet.com/Talk/am_i_being_unreasonable/a1604633-to-think-the-new-ASDA-advert-is-the-biggest-pile-of-sexist-crap-in-a-long-time">mighty, mighty Mumsnet</a> because they believe it to be sexist.</p>
<p>Before we go further, have you seen the advert? If not, here you go:</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/QiTuiYtaMV4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Opinions vary as to whether this is offensively sexist or whether such labels are merely the result of &#8216;political correctness gone mad.<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />&#8217; However, what is being depicted is pretty unambiguous, especially thanks to the &#8220;behind every Great Christmas, there&#8217;s mum&#8221; tagline at the end: Christmas is the result of Mum working very hard and (by inference) Dad being generally useless, not up to scratch and oblivious of her efforts. It falls squarely into what The Mary Sue terms <a href="http://www.themarysue.com/dumb-men-commercials/">Dumb Man Commercials</a>, whereby in order to appeal to the (presumed) female audience, the advertisers present men as foolish when compared to the power of womankind &#8211; if the power of womankind is limited to, say, cleaning an oven.</p>
<p>Now, lookit, there&#8217;s quite enough sexism going on at this time of year what with the pink aisle full of plastic dolls and retailers emblazoned with <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/12/14/all-i-want-for-christmas-is/">gender-segregated gifts</a> without the whole of Christmas being laid firmly and squarely on the shoulders of women and negating the role of anyone else in the fulfilment of annual joy. No pressure, love.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t really a post about lambasting the ASDA advert &#8211; many people have done that, and more eloquently too. What it is about is advertisers&#8217; <em>perception</em> of who we are as people, and whether that matches up to how we really are and how we think of ourselves.</p>
<p>Given the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/dec/11/census-2011-religion-race-education">results of the recent census</a>, we know that households such as the one depicted in the advert are not in the majority in the UK &#8211; far more people either live alone or are lone parents. So the assumption of &#8220;Mum&#8221; being the lynch pin for the &#8220;average&#8221; Christmas in the UK is not a reflection of reality.</p>
<p>There will be many families who rely on Dad, or another relative. There will be many Christmases spent amongst friends, or as a couple without children (like my own Yuletide will be). There will also be many Christmases in the UK that people spend alone &#8211; either through positive choice or sad circumstances. Lots of people don&#8217;t celebrate Christmas at all, of course. But I am absolutely not going to get into a discussion of religion as well as politics.</p>
<p>Well, not for this post.</p>

<blockquote><p>“It’s all about the joy of creation&#8230;”</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230; is the song that Lego use on their website to showcase their <a href="http://friends.lego.com/en-gb/Default.aspx" target="_blank">Friends series</a>.</p>
<p>Not what you were expecting? Perhaps you thought <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=GB&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;v=DwBirf4BWew" target="_blank"><strong>Stand By Your Man</strong></a> or some other such cringeworthy song might be more appropriate for a series so blatantly gendered. Well, so did I, but one happy little girl at a time, the Friends range has swayed my feelings.</p>
<p>Let me backtrack and give it some history.</p>
<p>The Lego Friends series was released earlier this year.</p>
<p>When the toys (and adverts) were unleashed, the internet seemingly exploded with outrage. (I am,<br />
of course, referring to <em>my</em> internet &#8211; the one with feminist twitter feeds, blogs about toys and sexy pictures of Neil Gaiman. Your internet might be a bit different.)</p>
<p>In particular I watched <a href="http://www.feministfrequency.com/" target="_blank">Feminist Frequency</a>’s <a href="http://www.feministfrequency.com/2012/01/lego-gender-part-1-lego-friends/" target="_blank">videos on</a> <a href="http://www.feministfrequency.com/2012/02/lego-gender-part-2-the-boys-club/" target="_blank">the series</a>, but I also read blogposts from dads who want their girls to work in Silicon Valley and study at MIT.</p>
<p>The first few toys released were a bakery, a café, a beauty shop, a house and an inventor’s<br />
workshop. These initial toys are made up of pastel pink and purple bricks, they only feature girls and<br />
those roles present are mainly gendered home-keeping roles.</p>
<p>My blood was boiling, like many other people&#8217;s, at the narrow roles I could see girls being pushed into. At my local Toys R Us there is a vast collection of Lego from the <a href="http://creator.lego.com/en-gb/Default.aspx" target="_blank">Creator series</a> to <a href="http://www.lego.com/cars/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank">Cars</a>. In fact I have never seen so much in one retailer.</p>
<p>However, the Friends series is not placed in their giant Lego selection. It is in a (very clearly labelled) ‘Girlz’ aisle,nowhere near the Lego corner, which has so much sparkle and glitter I thought cupcakes were<br />
going to spontaneously erupt from the walls.</p>
<p>Friends is not like the rest of Lego: it’s for girls, and must be segregated.</p>
<p>So far, so sexist.</p>
<p>However, I’m slowly putting the guns down. Across the various worlds of Lego, equality is growing. As someone who has an obsessive love of toys, I frequently visit their website. Every time I find<br />
myself riled up about Lego, I go on the site and find that a far greater balance of characters is presented there than we see in the shops.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/NyaSamura3.png"><img data-attachment-id="12907" data-permalink="/2012/12/11/guest-post-lego-friends-revisited/nyasamura3/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/NyaSamura3.png?fit=216%2C407&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="216,407" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="NyaSamura3" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/NyaSamura3.png?fit=159%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/NyaSamura3.png?fit=216%2C407&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-12907" title="NyaSamura3" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/NyaSamura3-159x300.png?resize=159%2C300" alt="Nya from Spinjitsu range" width="159" height="300" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/NyaSamura3.png?w=159&amp;ssl=1 159w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/NyaSamura3.png?w=216&amp;ssl=1 216w" sizes="(max-width: 159px) 100vw, 159px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>For example, they have little character bios for nearly every mini-figure. I was angry about the lack of girl characters in <a href="http://ninjago.lego.com/en-gb/Default.aspx" target="_blank">Spinjitzu</a>. But Nya (pictured right) has a  <a href="http://ninjago.lego.com/en-gb/world/characters/default.aspx" target="_blank">token girl description</a> which does include phrases like &#8220;she’s no damsel in distress&#8221; and &#8220;Nya is fed up with the ninjas’ boy’s club syndrome&#8221;.</p>
<p>Here, the minority female mini figures I have collected become role models. Still a token, but a valuable one at that, and the question remains why we don’t see more of this outside of the website.</p>
<p>I recently decided to explore the <a href="http://friends.lego.com/en-us/Products/Details/3934.aspx" target="_blank">Friends section of the website</a> and was pleasantly surprised and then genuinely excited about what it offers. I believe that Lego listened to t<a href="http://www.change.org/petitions/tell-lego-to-stop-selling-out-girls-liberatelego" target="_blank">he petition from Change.org</a> (the one that got over 50,000 signatures, the one I signed) back in April 2012, and have turned something that was completely sexist into a city of steps toward empowerment.</p>
<p>First of all, they have toned down the overwhelming pink tones of the bricks, and gone for more brown tones, like <a href="http://friends.lego.com/en-us/Products/Details/3185.aspx" target="_blank">the riding camp</a>. There is also a greater range of sets, including a <a href="http://friends.lego.com/en-us/Products/Details/3065.aspx" target="_blank">treehouse</a>, design<br />
studio, bedroom set with a drum kit and the <a href="http://friends.lego.com/en-us/Products/Details/3063.aspx" target="_blank">Heartlake Flying Club</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/flying.png"><img data-attachment-id="12905" data-permalink="/2012/12/11/guest-post-lego-friends-revisited/flying/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/flying.png?fit=575%2C335&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="575,335" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="flying" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/flying.png?fit=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/flying.png?fit=575%2C335&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-12905 aligncenter" title="flying" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/flying.png?resize=575%2C335" alt="Lego Friends flying school image of aeroplane" width="575" height="335" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/flying.png?w=575&amp;ssl=1 575w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/flying.png?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 575px) 100vw, 575px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>This last set was definitely the swing vote for me. It has the least amount of pink; mere touches of it on the plane. Furthermore, the stereotyped role for women in a plane is Air Hostess, and Lego didn’t go there. Stephanie is the pilot of her own seaplane, looking more Amelia Earhart than Pan Am.</p>
<p>The Friends themselves might enjoy traditionally feminine roles, but they also have jobs, varied interests and detailed characters that allow for diverse roleplaying. The key with Lego is that it can be as many things as you can imagine. <a href="http://friends.lego.com/en-us/Products/Details/3936.aspx" target="_blank">Emma’s Design Studio</a>, for instance, has one piece which suggests this is for fashion &#8211; but with the large desk, the ruler and the laptop Emma could just as easily be an architect or an engineer.</p>
<p>We also shouldn&#8217;t fall into the trap of thinking that enjoying balloons or sweets makes you weak. It&#8217;s more that giving girls <em>only</em> that which is sugary-sweet which is the issue. Although Lego still have a long way to go, I think there are at least positive conversations being had at Lego HQ.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.feministfrequency.com/2012/02/lego-gender-part-2-the-boys-club/" target="_blank">her second Lego video</a> Anita Sarkeseesian says that the emphasis with the Lego Friends series is on traditional home-keeping play. She cites the adverts, comparing the Friends advert slogan “Drive to the newly built café” to the “You can build the castle” of another Lego advert featuring some classic father-son bonding.</p>
<p>She draws the reasonable conclusion that boys are offered a more active play experience that encourages them to use maths and motor skills.</p>
<p>However, if we look on the Lego website the section for Friends has the theme song I quoted at the beginning of this post, which accompanies all their videos:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We can do it, we can dream a whole new way<br />
We can do it, you can build with me today<br />
It’s all about the joy of creation”</p></blockquote>
<p>I think this new emphasis on <em>building</em> which is subtly surrounding you the whole time you shop is part of a change that encourages girls to gain all the skills and experiences that Lego has to offer.</p>
<p>They may not have it all, but the newer Lego Friends sets and marketing are a step in the right direction, and with these steps being echoed in other areas of the Lego Universe… watch this space.</p>

She spends her hard-earned cash on Playmobil pirates and building Lego versions of Samus, and wants to see the childish books and toys she loves become more diverse and inclusive. She works in digital rights and has a host of other nerdy interests like comics, board games and First World War poetry.
