					<description><![CDATA[It's hard to find a way to re-appropriate any of these ideas in a positive way. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Hodge-note:</strong> This rather special item from the archives was originally #22 in the <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/category/alphabet/" target="_blank">Alphabet series</a>, and got mostly written (and illustrated) before I heard the siren song of <strong>vitriol</strong> instead, with its rich murder and rage connotations. <a title="V is for Vitriol" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/03/21/an-alphabet-of-feminism-22-v-is-for-vitriol/" target="_blank"><strong>Vitriol</strong></a> was duly inducted into the Alphabet official rankings and <strong>Virgin</strong> languished like a vestal until we thought maybe she should see the light of day&#8230;</p>
<p>Here she is:</p>
<h6 style="text-align: center;">V</h6>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">VIRGIN</h2>
<blockquote><p>And your quaint honour turn to dust<br />
And into ashes all my lust&#8230;</p>
<p>Andrew Marvell, <strong>To His Coy Mistress </strong>c.1640s</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Virgin</em> has a comparatively straightforward etymology: it derives from the Latin <em>virgo </em>(= &#8216;maiden&#8217;), whence the star-sign Virgo (apparently the sign of the shy, modest and meticulous, with a dash of perfectionism and anxiety). Its first sense (c.1200) is an ecclesiastical one: &#8216;an unmarried or chaste maiden or women, distinguished for piety or steadfastness in religion, and regarded as having a special place among the members of the Christian church on account of these merits.&#8217;</p>
<h2>Like a virgin</h2>
<div id="attachment_13600" style="width: 189px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/saint-lucy.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13600" data-attachment-id="13600" data-permalink="/2013/06/03/v-is-for-virgin-alphabet-b-sides-and-rarities/saint-lucy/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/saint-lucy.jpg?fit=415%2C599&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="415,599" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Saint Lucy, 1521" data-image-description="&lt;p&gt;Saint Lucy, with her eyes, as depicted in 1521&lt;/p&gt;
" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/saint-lucy.jpg?fit=208%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/saint-lucy.jpg?fit=415%2C599&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-13600   " alt="Saint Lucy, with her eyes, as depicted in 1521" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/saint-lucy.jpg?resize=179%2C258" width="179" height="258" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-13600" class="wp-caption-text">Saint Lucy, with her eyes, as depicted in 1521</p></div>
<p>There are innumerable such virgins in Christian hagiography: Saint Ursula had an army of 11,000 virgin handmaids who all had their heads chopped off (in a bit of a pun-fail); Saint Cecilia (patron saint of music) managed not only to persuade her husband to forbear on their wedding night, but also to join the Christian cause along with his brother, and suffer death in consequence.</p>
<p>Saint Lucy consecrated her virginity to God, and, supposedly, tore her own eyes out and gave them to her husband (who had admired them) as a kind of macabre substitute for the marital debt. (Lesson: never admire your girlfriend&#8217;s essential organs).</p>
<p>And, of course, there is the arch-virgin much mentioned in these posts – the eponymous Mary, who gets a definition all to herself as <em>virgin</em>&#8216;s fourth meaning.</p>
<p>Mary&#8217;s particular achievement &#8211; the Virgin Birth &#8211; is also considered of some importance in these definitions for <em>virgin</em>. It presumably lies behind the gloss &#8216;a female insect producing fertile <a title="O is for Ovary" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/01/24/an-alphabet-of-femininism-15-o-is-for-ovary/" target="_blank">eggs</a> by pathenogenesis [without the input of a male insect]&#8217; (1883), as well as <em>virgin</em>&#8216;s simple equivalence with &#8216;pathenogenesis&#8217; itself (1849) &#8211; a word with its origin in the Greek <em>parthenos</em>, also meaning &#8216;virgin&#8217; and &#8216;genesis&#8217; (= &#8216;creation&#8217;).</p>
<p>This &#8211; reproduction without fertilisation &#8211; though clearly associated with Mary in Christian tradition, is also arguably the origin of Adam, so it doesn&#8217;t have to be have an explicit cultural gender-association. Indeed, there is a Middle English citation for <em>virgin </em>that defines it as <span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">&#8216;a youth or man who has remained in a state of chastity&#8217;. But this is admittedly an unusual example among the definitions as a whole. </span></p>
<h2>A woman&#8217;s touch</h2>
<div id="attachment_13599" style="width: 207px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/vestal.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13599" data-attachment-id="13599" data-permalink="/2013/06/03/v-is-for-virgin-alphabet-b-sides-and-rarities/vestal/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/vestal.jpg?fit=246%2C388&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="246,388" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Roman depiction of a vestal virgin" data-image-description="&lt;p&gt;Roman depiction of a vestal virgin&lt;/p&gt;
" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/vestal.jpg?fit=190%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/vestal.jpg?fit=246%2C388&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-13599 " alt="Roman depiction of a vestal virgin" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/vestal.jpg?resize=197%2C310" width="197" height="310" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-13599" class="wp-caption-text">A Vestal Virgin</p></div>
<p>If we go back to ancient Rome, we meet another sense the religious meaning of <em>virgin</em> can have: the very non-Christian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestal_Virgin" target="_blank">Vestal Virgins</a>, a group of highly respected women whose job it was to guard the &#8216;sacred fire&#8217; and take care of the rituals and responsibilities that could not be dealt with by male priests.</p>
<p>They were so named because their duties were primarily to Vesta, the Roman goddess of the hearth and family, and, in consequence, the Vestal Virgins took on a role as kind of symbolic housewives to the whole of Rome.</p>
<p>Though they would be obliged to remain <em>virginal </em>throughout their time as priestesses, in the word&#8217;s second sense &#8216;a woman who is or remains in a state of inviolate chastity&#8217;, the vow only lasted thirty years, at the end of which they were free to marry (though most of them seem not to have been all that bothered).</p>
<p>This all said, while these saints and priestesses are all very much <em>virgins </em>in the most common sense of the word, the ecclesiastical meaning does not have to imply the sexual inexperience they normally connote, since &#8216;chastity&#8217; simply means &#8216;clean, pure&#8217; (from the Latin <em>castus</em>), and has no intrinsic connection with physical &#8216;intactness&#8217;, though it is frequently used as a synonym. In fact, the fourth definition for the second primary meaning of the word (where it can be used to describe things other than women) highlights &#8216;purity or freedom from stain&#8217; and being &#8216;unsullied&#8217;.</p>
<p>If you cast your mind back to &#8216;<a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/01/10/an-alphabet-of-femininism-13-m-is-for-marriage/" target="_blank">M is for Marriage</a>&#8216;, you may remember that <em>adultery </em>means &#8216;pollution of the marriage bed&#8217;, suggesting by association that the marriage bed was a sacred – or indeed &#8216;pure&#8217; – space. And indeed, marriage was widely considered invalid without consummation – something Henry VIII made much use of in his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_of_Cleves#A_doomed_marriage" target="_blank">royal divorces </a>– and, in consequence, the virtuous wife who dexterously trod the balance of Pure Marital Sex and Pollution of the Marriage Bed (whether by adultery as we conceive it, or by lusting after her husband) could be as much feted as the unmarried <em>virgin </em>(indeed, more so, if she proved herself skilled in housewifery and produced equally virtuous children).</p>

<p>That said, a curious and related term first cited in 1644 was <em>virgin widow</em>, meaning a woman whose husband had died before the marriage could be consummated, and whose status was therefore ambiguously poised between <em>virginity </em>(in the sense of being unmarried) and <a title="W is for Widow" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/03/28/an-alphabet-of-feminism-23-w-is-for-widow/" target="_blank"><em>widowhood </em></a>(being left behind after the death of a husband).</p>
<p>This was <a title="LRB Catherine of Aragon" href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v33/n15/eamon-duffy/the-unlikeliest-loophole" target="_blank">Catherine of Aragon</a>&#8216;s position, as argued at her divorce hearing, during the painful period  after Prince Arthur&#8217;s death &#8211; languishing in a political and social limbo, waiting for something to happen, steadily running out of money and losing points on the marriage market.</p>
<h2>Purity is a virtue of the soul</h2>
<p>An excellent, though somewhat horrific, example of the noble wife trope is <a title="Lucretia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucretia" target="_blank">Lucretia</a>, the virtuous spouse of Collatine, whose rape by the royal prince Tarquin so outraged Rome that it led directly to the establishment of the Roman republic. As a wife, Lucretia is not a technical <em>virgin</em>, but she is (as Shakespeare puts it in the oft-forgotten early poem <strong>The</strong> <strong>Rape of Lucrece </strong>(1594)) &#8216;Collatine&#8217;s fair love, Lucrece the <em>chaste</em>&#8216;.</p>
<p>Saint <a title="Augustine" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo" target="_blank">Augustine</a> posits that &#8216;<a title="Augustine" href="http://faculty.washington.edu/miceal/lgw/lucretia/Augustine.html" target="_blank">purity is a virtue of the soul</a>&#8216;, and since body and soul are (in this reading) distinct, Lucrece can consummate her marriage while still retaining her essential &#8216;bodily sanctity&#8217; because she is free of polluting lust in the process.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Unfortunately, Collatine spends so much time bragging about his wife&#8217;s chastity to the bros in the camp that he invites trouble:</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Haply that name of &#8220;chaste&#8221; unhapp&#8217;ly set<br />
The bateless edge on [Tarquin&#8217;s] appetite</p>
<p>Shakespeare, <strong>The Rape of Lucrece</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Lucretia is so traumatised by Tarquin&#8217;s subsequent rape that she stabs herself rather than &#8216;live impure&#8217;, widely considered by the (male) world to be a Noble Decision. This led to her immortalisation in literature and philosophy as a perfect wife, but also prompted Augustine to engage in some terrible rape apologism in the service of his broader argument (</span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">&#8216;If she was adulterous, why praise her? if chaste, why slay her?&#8217;).</span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><br />
</span></p>
<h2>Saints and sieves</h2>
<p>It is presumably a version of this chastity-of-the-soul idea so beloved by Augustine that lies behind the story of Tuccia, the Vestal Virgin who proves her virginity by carrying water from the Tiber in a sieve without spilling a drop (<a title="Tuccia" href="http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/upload/img/moroni-vestal-virgin-tuccia-NG3123-fm.jpg" target="_blank">here she is </a>depicted in 1555 with the sieve itself, and wearing an outfit that leaves little to the imagination, chaste or otherwise).</p>
<p>I suppose the idea behind the sieve story is that something that would normally flow through the porous surface is maintained &#8216;intact&#8217;, perhaps representing the pure soul within a porous body. At any rate, it became a key symbol of virginity, most notably in the &#8216;Sieve Portrait&#8217; of the &#8216;<a title="Q is for Queen" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/02/07/an-alphabet-of-femininism-17-q-is-for-queen/" target="_blank">Virgin Queen</a>&#8216; Elizabeth I, who is also cited in the Dictionary as a definition of <i>virgin </i>in herself.</p>
<p>The last citation given in the dictionary for <em>virgin</em>, with which we will end, is from 1780, as &#8216;a fortress or city that has never been taken or subdued&#8217;. This has an obvious resonance with Lucrece, and the ultimately martial tale her story becomes &#8211; another link between feminine &#8216;closedness&#8217; and men&#8217;s military convenience.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to find a way to re-appropriate any of these ideas in a positive way. But maybe this transferred definition or fortresses and cities should make us think about Elizabeth I, who at least made them work to her own military and political advantage.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[If you remember the Alphabet of Feminism, this one's for you. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Ed&#8217;s note:</strong> In the original Alphabet we did <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/10/18/an-alphabet-of-femininism-3-c-is-for-crinoline/" target="_blank">&#8216;C is for Crinoline&#8217;</a> &#8211; but here&#8217;s something we thought was topically worth coming back to.</p>
<h6 style="text-align: center;">C</h6>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">CHIVALRY</h2>
<blockquote><p>Chivalry is dead, but you&#8217;re still kinda cute.</p>
<p>&#8211; Nelly Furtado, <strong>Promiscuous</strong> (2006)</p></blockquote>
<p>Chivalry. Not one of feminism&#8217;s most pressing issues, but definitely one of its more genteel <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/01/25/keep-the-gift-pay-what-you-owe/" target="_blank">debates</a>.</p>
<p>Do you, as an attractive female who also happens to be a feminist, deign to take the seat that dude offers you on the crowded tube or laugh hollowly and stick your head back in your neighbour&#8217;s armpit? Is chivalry OK?</p>
<p>Personally, my view on this debate is always affected by the point that 99% of the men I&#8217;ve met who talk about chivalry with misty-eyed fervour are also the kind of Nice Guys who Really Aren&#8217;t Very Nice At All.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not for here.</p>
<p>What I am interested in is looking at its complex linguistic heritage.</p>
<h2>Horses</h2>
<p>What&#8217;s that sound in the distance?</p>
<p>Why, it&#8217;s the sound of clopping hooves &#8211; and<em> chivalry</em>&#8216;s etymological root come to join us. Neiiigh.</p>

<p>For though <em>chivalry<strong> </strong></em>in English means (first definition ahoy!)  &#8216;the code of behaviour demonstrated<em> by a perfect knight</em>&#8216;, were we French we&#8217;d replace &#8216;knight&#8217; with &#8216;<em>chevalier</em>&#8216;, or &#8216;horseman&#8217; &#8211; from the root word <em>cheval</em> (= &#8216;horse&#8217;).</p>
<p>The knight, or <em>chevalier</em>, is <em> </em>in origin a nobleman on horseback who goes around rescuing maidens and fighting dragons. He is <em>chivalrous </em>in behaviour, displaying (the word&#8217;s second definition) &#8216;courage, honour, justice and readiness to help the weak&#8217;.</p>
<p>Key examples can be found in the legends of King Arthur and his horsebacked Knights of the Round Table &#8211; in particular Sir Gawain and the so-good-he-couldn&#8217;t-be-gooder Sir Percival (who later becomes Wagner&#8217;s <strong>Parsifal</strong>).</p>
<p>The chivalrous are those on horseback.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s the secondary meaning of <em>chivalry</em> that we best recognise today: &#8216;<em>courteous</em> behaviour, especially towards women&#8217; (that is, giving up your seat on the tube, which Percival would totally have done if he didn&#8217;t travel everywhere by <em>cheval</em>).<em> </em></p>
<h2>Courtly-powered lovin&#8217;</h2>
<p>Chivalry &#8211; and the <em>courtesy </em>that defines it &#8211; is also the base idea behind <em>courtly</em> <em>love</em>, which the devoted may remember we addressed separately in the <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/12/20/an-alphabet-of-femininism-12-l-is-for-lady/" target="_blank">Alphabet Glory Days</a>.</p>

<p>This is what the knights are doing when they&#8217;re not out fighting &#8211;  sighing for love among rose bushes, swooning at the touch of a <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/11/01/an-alphabet-of-femininism-5-e-is-for-emancipate/" target="_blank">&#8216;lily-white hand&#8217;</a> and <em>definitely </em>giving up their seats for a woman on the medieval commute.</p>
<p>And it was said to have been invented by a woman, Eleanor of Aquitaine.</p>
<p>Before she married Henry II and brought her French customs over to England, Eleanor had a period presiding alone over a predominantly male grouping in Poitiers.It seems inventing an elaborate code of chaste devotion to a single lady &#8211; <em>court</em>eous behaviour, if you will &#8211; was a good way for Eleanor to bring these bored and potentially restless knights into order &#8211; and, I assume, to block potential sexual aggression at the same time (cf. the court of Elizabeth I, which saw a resurgence of &#8216;courtly&#8217; devotion to &#8216;Gloriana&#8217;, the &#8216;Virgin <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/02/07/an-alphabet-of-femininism-17-q-is-for-queen/" target="_blank">Queen</a>&#8216;).</p>
<h2>Courtship</h2>
<p>With these courtly roots, it&#8217;s appropriate that, during the English Civil War, the word <em>chevalier </em>should lend itself so enthusiastically to the Royalist cause in fighting for king (and court).</p>
<p>In this context, the Cavaliers were enemies to the Roundheads and cousins to <em>chevaliers</em> via the Latin source-word &#8216;cabellarius&#8217; (also meaning &#8216;horseman&#8217;).</p>
<p>The origin of this term is actually pre-war, in the grouping of courtly &#8216;cavaliers&#8217; at the original Carolingian court (a bit like the courtly lovers at Poitiers).</p>
<p>These included the &#8216;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavalier_poet" target="_blank">Cavalier poets</a>&#8216;, a conglomerate of literary courtiers formed by the King himself, including Robert Herrick and Edmund Waller.</p>
<p>The term in this usage is ambiguous, though. On the one hand, <em>cavalier</em> was often used in allusion to the King&#8217;s refined (indeed &#8216;knightly&#8217;) sensibilities, which, incidentally, included a famous love of horses &#8211; as the many magnificent equestrian portraits of him attest.</p>
<p>But, in a pejorative sense, the <em>cavalier poets </em>were so named because they were famously &#8216;roistering gallants&#8217; and &#8216;libertines&#8217;. This is <em>cavalier</em>&#8216;s other meaning: &#8216;haughty, disdainful or supercilious&#8217; or &#8216;offhand and unceremonious&#8217; (a bit like wearing your hat at a<a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/02/14/an-alphabet-of-femininism-18-r-is-for-rake/" target="_blank"> &#8216;rakish&#8217; angle</a>).</p>
<p>So <em>cavalier </em>is almost a contraction in terms.</p>
<h2>The Don</h2>
<p>This is the very ambiguity we find in Mozart&#8217;s great libertine opera, <strong>Don Giovanni</strong>, written about 100 years later. The &#8216;Don&#8217; is a nobleman and serial womaniser. He&#8217;s a standard-issue<a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/02/14/an-alphabet-of-femininism-18-r-is-for-rake/" target="_blank"> rake</a>, in fact: we learn in the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fccdGBi9JUs&amp;t=2m30s" target="_blank">Catalogue Song</a> that he&#8217;s seduced 1,003 women in Spain alone.</p>

<p>He is throughout referred to in the Italian as a &#8216;cavalier&#8217;, understood (and, for us English-speakers, translated) according to context variously as &#8216;gentleman&#8217; (nobleman on horseback) and &#8216;rake&#8217; (careless womaniser) &#8211; as in the opera&#8217;s subtitle, &#8216;Il <em>dissoluto</em> punito&#8217; (&#8216;the debauchee punished&#8217;).</p>
<p>Thus, when Don Giovanni takes the pretty peasant girl Zerlina away from her finance, Masetto, to show her his castle (no, really), Don Giovanni &#8216;reassures&#8217; the jealous Masetto by saying he needn&#8217;t worry &#8211; his fiancee is &#8216;in the hands of a <em>cavalier</em>&#8216;.Unfortunately, that&#8217;s exactly what Masetto is afraid of. &#8220;Let the<em> cavaliere </em>make a <em>cavaliera</em> out of you!&#8221; he trumpets at the departing Zerlina &#8211; he knows what&#8217;s going down (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q40a23gfxZE" target="_blank">this</a>).</p>
<h2>Court to City</h2>
<p>Back to English climes.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the eighteenth century, Queen Anne halved the size of the English court and moved it out of central London.</p>
<p>In so doing, she ultimately ended up transferring power from court to city &#8211; and <em>courtesy </em>became <em></em>civility (from the Latin <em>cives</em> (= the city)).</p>

<p>This is the age of opening doors, watching your language and standing up when a woman enters the room. Chivalry has gone domestic; men are <em>civil </em>now in Britain. Only the hot-headed Italian Don Giovannis are still <em>cavaliers</em>.</p>
<p>But when Samuel Richardson wanted to depict a perfect (but domestic) Englishman, he still made him an aristocratic knight (<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sir</span> Charles Grandison</strong>). Jane Austen did too: her paragon of virtue (himself based on Sir Charles), is pointedly named Mr <em>Knightly</em> (<strong>Emma</strong>).By this point it&#8217;s faded away to a name rather than a title, but the gentleman still has a vestigial horse (if you will).</p>
<h2>White Knights</h2>
<p>Strangely enough, the vestigial horse becomes more literal in the modern age, in the form of the ladies&#8217; proverbial &#8216;ideal man&#8217; &#8211; a chivalrous gentleman. Mr Right is also a &#8216;knight in shining armour&#8217;.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s even a  Lewis Carroll-esque &#8216;White Knight&#8217;, a noble rescuer (as in the song &#8216;My White Knight&#8217; from Meredith Wilson&#8217;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_oyzwsJOhU" target="_blank"><strong>The Music Man</strong></a>, where the knight in question will, her mother thinks, &#8216;save&#8217; Marian the Librarian from Old Maidery).</p>
<p>Remember when Grace first meets Leo &#8211; the Great Romance &#8211; in <strong>Will and Grace</strong>? He&#8217;s on a horse in Central Park. That&#8217;s how you know he&#8217;s a Big Deal Romance.</p>
<h2>Never trust a man on horseback</h2>
<p>And, to conclude very crudely, I suppose this is what happened to <em>chivalry </em>.</p>
<p>It became the polite behaviour of the  gentleman &#8211; enshrined in tradition and developed over a couple of hundred years to become our friend offering me a seat on the bustling 21st century commute<strong> </strong>and sitcom single girls dreaming of their &#8216;Mr Darcy&#8217;.</p>
<p>But I still hear the sound of clopping hooves. The fantasy may be more Sir Gawain than Don Giovanni, but you know what they say &#8211; the apple never falls far from the lexical tree.</p>

<p>All together now: THE LAST ALPHABET POST EVER. And it&#8217;s a word with one of the longest definitions I&#8217;ve yet come across: <em>zone</em>, first cited in 1500, from the Latin <em>zona </em>and the Greek <em>zone</em>, which originally means &#8216;girdle&#8217;.</p>

<p>Its complexity is mainly owing to the range of disciplines that have claimed it for their own; these include astrology, astronomy, physical geography, mathematics, poetry, and crystallography. Its immediate practical meaning is geographical: &#8216;Each of the five &#8216;belts&#8217; or encircling regions, differing in climate, into which the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn and the Arctic and Antarctic circles divide the surface of the earth&#8217; – that is, &#8216;the <em>torrid</em> (burning) zone between the tropics, the (north and south) <em>temperate zones </em>extending from the tropics to the polar circles, and the <em>frigid </em>(frozen) zones<em> </em>(arctic and antarctic) within the polar circles&#8217;.</p>
<p>A <em>zone</em>, then, is a &#8216;belt&#8217; that marks out space, enclosing and dividing at once, as reflected in its vaguer sense from 1559 as &#8216;any region extending round the earth and comprised between definite limits&#8217;, where it is also applied to &#8216;a similar region in the heavens or on the surface of a planet&#8217;.</p>
<p>Of course, the Ancient Egyptians gave the practical sky-based role of <em>zoning </em>to a woman –<em> Nut</em>, the goddess of the sky, married to the earth god Geb (an unusual gendering). Nut is depicted throughout Egyptian art as a naked woman arched over the earth, balancing on her fingertips and tiptoes, and often covered in stars, from which position she protects the sun god Ra, and the earth below – a <em>zone </em>in its fourth sense (from 1591), as &#8216;a circumscribing or enclosing ring, band, or line&#8217;. Whence it is but a short step to 1608&#8217;s contribution to the party, <em>zone</em> as &#8216;a girdle or belt, as part of a dress&#8217; (chiefly &#8216;poetical&#8217;), which is really the only literal use for the word: before the word&#8217;s adoption into English, Ancient Greek women wore a &#8216;<em>zona</em>&#8216; under their clothes to accentuate the figure.<br />
<BR></BR></p>
<h3>Alas! My Girdle!</h3>
<p>So we end where we began: with an <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/10/04/an-alphabet-of-femininism-1-a-is-for-amazon/">extra-snazzy belt</a>. Women&#8217;s girdles have a long and varied history going back to the <em><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cestus">cestus</a> </em>or &#8216;Belt of Venus&#8217;, an ill-judged wedding present to the Goddess of Love from her husband Hephaestus which rendered her irresistible to men (and, appropriately, endures on as an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_of_Venus">astronomy term</a>). Martial refers to the <em>cestus </em>in his Epigrams as &#8216;a cincture that kindled love in Jupiter&#8217; (planetary theme ftw), and clearly considered it quite hot stuff himself, since it was &#8216;&#8230;still warm from Venus&#8217; fire&#8217;.</p>
<p>The Medieval West was not to be left behind in all this sexy-talk: no right-thinking female of the thirteen-hundreds considered herself fully sexed-up without a <em>gipon</em>, a type of corset designed to flatten the breasts and emphasise the stomach. And in case this proved insufficient, she might also pad her belly out for extra effect – well-rounded bellies <a href="http://cgfa.acropolisinc.com/eyck/eyck6.jpg">appear</a> <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Les_Tres_Riches_Heures_du_duc_de_Berry_avril_detail.jpg">again</a> and <a href="http://storage.canalblog.com/15/58/119589/34529891.jpg">again</a> in contemporary art – and, as with the Cranach Venus (above), a decorative <em>zone </em>was the perfect way to emphasise its shape, making this a garment no less sexually charged in the 1340s than the <a href="http://www.girdlezone.org/">1940s</a> (when, of course, its job was to hold the belly <em>in</em>). Like a <em>garter</em>, then, a <em>girdle </em>could serve as a fetishistic focal point for erotic (and indeed erogenous) <em>zones</em>, marking them out and keeping them restrained at the same time.</p>

<p>The Dictionary seems to have picked up something of this atmospheric heat itself, and brings us all back to earth by citing for this sense of the word Francis Quarles&#8217; <strong>Emblem VIII</strong> (&#8216;Shall these coarse hands untie / The sacred zone of thy virginity?&#8217; (1635)). Neatly, this citation highlights the flip-side of <em>zone</em>&#8216;s erotic focus – the Roman marriage ceremony famously culminated in the groom untying his wife&#8217;s girdle (enduring into the thigh-rubbing Latin slang phrase &#8216;<em>zonam solvere</em>&#8216; – &#8216;to untie the girdle&#8217;).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the <em>chastity belt</em> (which also encompasses the &#8216;torrid zone between the tropics&#8217;, if you want to be vulgar about it) supposedly made its debut in Western society during the Crusades, lest the mice should play while the cats were off murdering Muslims. They may have been a niche market then, but – under the waggish and consistent alias &#8216;Venus&#8217; belt&#8217; – they were certainly widespread enough by the sixteenth century to become a target for satire. It was not until 1718 that English got the separate word <em>zoned</em>, but its meaning – &#8216;wearing a zone or girdle, hence, chaste&#8217; – was clearly familiar to Francis Quarles, although he&#8217;s not talking about a literal woman, but about the relationship between body and soul.</p>
<p>John Donne plays with this conceit in his <strong><a href="http://www.luminarium.org/sevenlit/donne/elegy20.htm">Elegy: To His Mistress Going To Bed</a></strong>, which famously describes the &#8216;mistress&#8217; in question as &#8216;my America&#8217;. Her &#8216;girdle&#8217; glitters like &#8216;heaven&#8217;s <em>zone</em>&#8216; (viz.: the celestial sphere), but the woman&#8217;s body is itself a &#8216;world&#8217;, a &#8216;new-found land&#8217;, and the speaker&#8217;s &#8216;roving hands&#8217; explorers in a &#8216;kingdom&#8217; – just as in<strong><a href="http://www.luminarium.org/sevenlit/donne/sunrising.htm"> The Sun Rising</a></strong>, &#8216;she&#8217;s all states, and all princes I&#8217;. It&#8217;s not just Donne (<a href="http://www.luminarium.org/sevenlit/carew/rapture.htm">Thomas Carew</a> did it too): think how many landmarks are claimed for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sleeping_Lady">sleeping giantesses</a>, using the female body to map out geographical <em>zones</em>, just as geographical <em>zones</em> can be used to map out a woman (what else is the <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mons_pubis">mons veneris</a></em>?), and think back to <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_2709_2.jpg">Sir Francis Dashwood, landscaping pudendas in his garden</a>.</p>
<p>Much like the <em>zone </em>itself, this Alphabet has tried to encompass various notions of womanhood. Come back soon and maybe there&#8217;ll be a final post mortem-style analysis&#8230; </p>

<p>If you&#8217;re in East London on Sunday, you should totally swing by the <a href="http://www.londonzinesymposium.org.uk/">Zine Symposium.</a> For Hodge will be in attendance armed with a selection of Alphabet goodies, including a very few <strong>ALPHABET POSTERS</strong>.</p>
<p>If you missed the first run (which you probably did, as there were only <strong>ten</strong> and only <strong>one </strong>actually went on public sale) these are currently rarer than tyrannosaurus eggs, and there&#8217;s no guarantee there will be another run in the near future. For the Hodge thy Hodge is a jealous Hodge, and can&#8217;t be dashing to the print shop every five minutes.</p>

<p>Affordable, fun and an opportunity to expose Hodge&#8217;s true identity. Plus loads of cool zines and fun people. What&#8217;s not to like?</p>
<p>Check her out at the bereavement tape table.</p>
<p>&#8230;totally just realised this says &#8216;by hodge&#8217; at the top. i don&#8217;t talk about myself in the third person on a regular basis.</p>

<p>Ahem. <em>Yes </em>is the last of our Old English words. It&#8217;s <em>gise </em>or <em>gese, </em>meaning &#8216;so be it&#8217;, perhaps from <em>gea, ge </em>(= &#8216;so&#8217;), plus <em>si</em> (=&#8217;be it!&#8217;), the third person imperative of <em>beon</em> (= &#8216;to be&#8217;). In this form, <em>yes</em> was stronger than its Germanic cognate, <em>yea </em>(much like today) and, apparently, was often used in Shakespeare as an answer to negative questions. We could do with one of them nowadays, no? How many times have you answered a question with <em>yes </em>when you mean <em>no</em>? (&#8216;Doesn&#8217;t she&#8230;.?&#8217; &#8216;&#8230;Yes, she doesn&#8217;t&#8217;).</p>
<p>The penultimate word in our Alphabet, <em>yes </em>is frequently one of the first words we learn on earth; its meaning is clear and unequivocal, by turns disastrous, passionate, exhilarating, loaded and humdrum &#8211; but always positive in the full sense of that word. It is almost invariably repeated, as in Joyce (and Usher) &#8211; &#8216;yes I will, Yes&#8217;, the successive affirmations underlining and confirming the first &#8211; just like a <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=W7eLlRE-5OwC&amp;pg=PA253&amp;lpg=PA253&amp;dq=ulysses+gramophone+hear+say+yes+in+joyce&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OCKYHR7yyY&amp;sig=Y5Za4Hwk3Sfp2sFGKGxS0xR5Nfw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=9MbzTNvyEOCAhAfmrJCLDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=ulysses%20gramophone%20hear%20say%20yes%20in%20joyce&amp;f=false">signature</a> under your printed name, if you listen to Derrida</p>
<h3>Sure &#8216;Nuff n&#8217; Yes I Do</h3>
<p>James &#8216;<a href="http://www.bedeutung.co.uk/theblog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/james_joyce.jpg">Awesome Glasses</a>&#8216; Joyce apparently made much of his novel &#8216;novel&#8217; <strong>Ulysses</strong> ending on this, which he considered &#8216;the female word&#8217;. The final chapter, &#8216;Penelope&#8217;, often also referred to as &#8216;Molly Bloom&#8217;s soliloquy&#8217;, is 42 pages of just eight sentences, wherein Molly, wife of Leopold Bloom, muses to herself in bed.</p>
<p>For those who have better things to do than wrestle with a modernist doorstop, as the wife of the novel&#8217;s &#8216;Ulysses&#8217;, Molly is a counterpart to &#8216;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penelope">Penelope</a>&#8216;, wife of Odysseus / Ulysses and conventional model of <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/03/28/an-alphabet-of-feminism-23-w-is-for-widow/">marital fidelity</a>. The similarity expires fairly quickly, since Joyce&#8217;s Penelope is having an affair with &#8216;Blazes Boylan&#8217;, but nonetheless her chapter is often named after Ulysses&#8217; wife. It begins and ends with this <em>yes</em>, and in a letter to Frank Budgen, Joyce explained that &#8216;Penelope&#8217; rotates around what he considered the four cardinal points of the female  body &#8211; &#8216;breasts, arse, womb and cunt&#8217; &#8211; expressed respectively by the words <em>because, bottom, woman</em> and <em>yes</em>. Some of the comparisons are clear – the <em><a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/03/14/an-alphabet-of-feminism-21-u-is-for-uterus/">womb</a></em> has long been seen as synonymous with &#8216;woman&#8217; (however reductively); <em>bottom / arse –</em> ok; <em>because / breasts&#8230; </em>um?; <em>yes / cunt – </em>hmm.</p>
<p>I suspect this last pairing has a lot to do with the affirmation of sex: interaction with this organ <strong>should</strong> be one preceded by <em>yes </em>and punctuated with repetitions of this confirmation (<em>yes yes yes</em>). (Why James Joyce, you filthy&#8230;). We see a similar thing in Usher (first time for everything): the repeated <em>yeah, yeah, yeah </em>is a sexual affirmation – &#8216;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiXbRBS5Z58">How the hell am I supposed to leave??</a>&#8216;. This is about a female seduction (&#8216;she&#8217;s saying &#8220;come get me&#8221;!&#8217;), but one that we suspect will not end in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCss0kZXeyE">when-i&#8217;m-sixty-four</a> style knitting by the fire. For one thing, we learn that Usher already has a &#8216;<a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/11/15/an-alphabet-of-femininism-7-g-is-for-girl/">girl</a>&#8216;, who happens to be &#8216;the best of homies&#8217; with this club seductress; for another, Ludacris announces they will leave after a couple of drinks because they &#8216;want a <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/12/20/an-alphabet-of-femininism-12-l-is-for-lady/">lady</a> in the street but a freak in the bed&#8217;. So actually, the art of being a <em>lady </em>lies in effectively concealing a consent that, in private, becomes loud, repeated and unstoppable.</p>
<h3>Yes Indeed</h3>

The 'Easy Girlfriend' Poster, 1943-4</p></div>
<p>This is a well-trodden path, and all part of the old idea of how consent given too easily (<em>yes yes yes</em>) – or, in some cases, even given at all – is liable to get females into trouble. A less well-trodden example is Richardson&#8217;s <strong>Sir Charles Grandison </strong>(1753), which devotes several hundred of its thousand or so pages to what happens after the protagonist has proposed to his fiance: though she has accepted the proposal, she fears that to &#8216;name the day&#8217; herself – or even to consent to a &#8216;day&#8217; suggested to her – would be to show a forwardness disturbing in a woman. Disturbing perhaps, but probably a relief to the exhausted reader, for she manages to suspend her final consent to &#8216;thursday a month hence&#8217; for an entire blushing, confused volume of this hefty tome.</p>
<p>We can go further back, of course: in Shakespeare-times, Juliet fears Romeo will think she is &#8216;too quickly won&#8217;. To correct this, she offers to &#8216;frown, and be perverse, and say thee <em>nay</em>&#8216; (<em>no no yes</em>), artificially constructing a well-won consent where positive affirmation already exists (history does not record whether or not Juliet was &#8216;a freak in the bed&#8217;). Many would-be Romeos have seized on such fears to assume (or convince themselves) that this is just what their ladies are doing when they give an unequivocal &#8216;no&#8217;, so seduction narratives are littered with lovers assuming their lovers really mean <em>yes </em>when they reply in the negative<em> – </em>examples have spanned Austen&#8217;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWx7AF8B0R8&amp;feature=related">Mr Collins</a> to modern day Mills &amp; Boon. Apparently, in the latter case, one is supposed to find this irresistible.</p>
<h3>Go No More A-Roving</h3>
<p>We&#8217;re teetering around something rather insidious here, and one aspect of this finds its expression in a 1940s propaganda poster. The &#8216;Easy Girlfriend&#8217; anti-VD advert placed the blame for the Second World War venereal epidemic squarely with the momento-mori type be-hatted skull (a sexually experienced re-appropriation of the medieval <a href="http://www.abcgallery.com/B/baldung/baldung16.JPG">Death and the Maiden</a> trope). &#8216;The &#8220;easy&#8221; girlfriend spreads syphilis and gonorrhea&#8217;, it blazed – she who says <em>yes </em>too easily is to be shunned by polite society, and will be – <em>naturellement </em>– riddled with disease. Of course, syphilis&#8217; original spread throughout Europe had followed the path of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Tour">Grand Tour</a>, but this must have been because Venetian prostitutes were taking expensive package holidays throughout France, Spain, Rome, Switzerland and Turkey, mustn&#8217;t it, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Byron">Lord Byron</a>?</p>
<p>So while you probably disagree with Joyce&#8217;s view that <em>yes </em>is an intrinsically female word, it&#8217;s certainly one whose utterance is littered with potential problems for women. <em>Yes </em>means <em>yes. </em></p>

<p>Yet this word – simultaneously standing in for itself and existing as an independent unit of meaning – is possibly one of the most widely-used symbols of all. How exactly this might be relevant to a consideration of feminism will be herein considered, but I hope my indulgent readers will excuse a slightly cheeky use of theoretical thinking. We all know each other well enough by now, don&#8217;t we?</p>
<h3>VCR</h3>
<p>The most straightforward significance of X is, as Latin-fans will know, &#8216;ten&#8217; / &#8217;10&#8217; (I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X). Two tens side by side is <em>XX</em>, or twenty / 20. How many tens can you think of? Ten lost tribes of Israel, ten commandments, ten plagues of Egypt, ten dimes in a dollar, ten years in a decade. It&#8217;s a pleasingly round number, and an easy times table, even if it frequently loses out to &#8216;twelve&#8217; / &#8217;12&#8217; in mystic significance.</p>
<p>But <em>x </em>is not simply a linguistic unit: it is also a visual one. Two diagonal lines; two Vs touching each other; a crossover; a cross; a cross-roads. Like &#8216;0&#8217;, which means &#8216;oh&#8217;, &#8216;o&#8217;, &#8216;zero&#8217; and &#8216;nothing&#8217;, it represents one of its meanings aesthetically: it is a <em>cross. </em>Thus King&#8217;s X and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_cross#Charing_.28now_Charing_Cross.29">Charing X</a> (this last was named for the <em>Eleanor Cross </em>built on the site by Richard I to commemorate the funeral procession of his wife) – but, perhaps because of its relationship to the Greek letter &#8216;Chi&#8217; (&#8216;Ch-&#8216;), which is the first letter of &#8216;Christ&#8217;, <em>x </em>can also signify he-who-died-on-a-cross (&#8216;<em>X-mas</em>&#8216;), although it actually looks more like the St. Andrew cross, which makes up the Scottish flag.</p>
<h3>Crystalised</h3>
<p>In numerical terms, though, <em>x </em>can also take on the role of an unknown quantity – &#8216;Find the value of <em>x</em>&#8216;, where the <em>x </em>is italicised to mark its distinction from &#8216;x&#8217;. It is &#8216;unknown&#8217;, not &#8216;multiply&#8217;, an absent value rather than a pluralised one. Here too, we bump into a common significance <em>x </em>has: it represents absence. It is the legal signature of the illiterate (&#8216;I cannot write; here is the <em>x </em>that represents &#8220;yes, I agree&#8221; but also &#8220;no, I cannot write&#8221;), and the standard stand-in for a quantity that is unknown or not yet provided (&#8216;Dear X&#8217;).</p>
<p>The unknown or unstated quantity has also fed over into censorship: an <em>X-rated </em>film is one only suitable for those aged over 18. It was replaced in 1982 by the &#8217;18&#8217; certificate, but such certificates have frequently been seen by directors as more of a target than an impediment: Hitchcock&#8217;s extremely grim <strong>Frenzy </strong>(1972) was conceived to coincide with the USA&#8217;s revised <em>R-rating</em> so that the Master of Suspense could claim his place in the pantheon of horror with a badge of censored honour.</p>

<p>This was his penultimate film, and the only one to carry an &#8217;18&#8217; certificate in the UK or receive an <em>&#8216;X-rating&#8217; </em>after the age restriction was moved up to 18 in 1971. It&#8217;s about a rapist serial-killer. If the accusation of misogyny leveled at him impedes your appreciation of Hitchcock&#8217;s films as a whole, I would not recommend this one. It features an extended rape scene shot with a disturbing emphasis on its supposed eroticism, and some true masterpieces of misogyny <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068611/quotes">in the dialogue</a>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRfbuQgJsjY">this scene</a>, which features Babs&#8217; death: from the moment Rust enters the frame we know she&#8217;s dead, and the line which precedes the attack, &#8216;You&#8217;re my kind of woman&#8217; (whose results we have already seen in graphic form on his previous victim) precedes one of Hitchcock&#8217;s most underrated panning shots: the camera backs out down the stairs and out into the street in what the director himself dubbed &#8216;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS77YJuiaw">Bye Bye To Babs</a>&#8216;. This is the second of the film&#8217;s rape-murders and one no less disturbing for being &#8216;exed out&#8217; – its self-censorship makes its own point.</p>
<p>There is a beautifully dark irony in how this most censored of Hitchcock&#8217;s films is also one focused almost entirely around silencing and deleting women – <em>exing </em>them by using the Latin prefix &#8216;out of, from, utterly, beyond&#8217; (<em>ex</em>), thus, in verbal form, &#8216;to delete, to cross off&#8217; (as in &#8216;to <em>x</em>&#8216;, to &#8216;cross&#8217;, which can also be &#8216;to thwart&#8217; – &#8216;Don&#8217;t cross me!&#8217;). This is the <em>x-</em>form that gives us &#8216;<em>ex-boyfriend, ex-girlfriend, ex-wife</em>&#8216;, so that the <em>x </em>acts as a negative, canceling out the word that follows it, making the <em>spouse </em>a <em>stranger</em>, and the act of so doing is, in fact, an act of deletion – &#8216;<em>exing</em>&#8216; someone, crossing them out (indeed, we frequently drop the specifics altogether, don&#8217;t we? &#8216;My ex&#8217;.)</p>
<p>If you buy the theory that Hitch was himself a Horrible Misogynist (which, with regret, I think I must – in this film at least) – the fact that he chose a kind of Jack the Ripper style return to his London roots for his attempt on the R-rating is a masterpiece of gyno-negation (yes I made that compound up, but I&#8217;m running with it):</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Solicitor in Pub</strong>: Let&#8217;s hope he slips up soon.<br />
<strong>Doctor in Pub</strong>: In one way I rather hope he doesn&#8217;t. We haven&#8217;t had a good juicy series of sex murders since Christie. And they&#8217;re so good for the tourist trade. Foreigners somehow expect the squares of London to be fog-wreathed, full of hansom cabs and *littered* with ripped whores, don&#8217;t you think?</p>
<p><strong>Frenzy </strong>(1972)</p></blockquote>
<h3>Heart Skipped A Beat</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 13px;">It is, then, fantastically dark yet undeniably fitting that <em>x </em>is frequently appropriated as a symbol of sexytimes: XXX (thirty) means &#8216;extra strong&#8217;, via an <em>x</em> homonym <em>extra</em>. Thus it is an identifier for pornography and <em>x-rated </em>movies, and, in the form <em>.xxx</em> is a &#8216;sponsored top level domain&#8217; (what?) intended as a voluntary option for porn sites (instead of .com, .co.uk etc), to allow clear classification and prevent The Children accessing such sites &#8216;by accident&#8217;. The difficulty here, of course, is that it requires binary identification of What Is Porn and What Is Not (of which more presently).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 13px;">In lower-case form, xxx connects love and lust: most people know of x = kiss (I&#8217;ve always wondered if there&#8217;s something in &#8216;k&#8217; being an &#8216;x&#8217; that may have hit a wall), but Wikipedia claims &#8216;xxx&#8217; means &#8216;I love you&#8217; through the power of three. Like &#8216;heart&#8217;, which is a very different thing from &#8216;love&#8217; (&#8216;I heart NY&#8217;), &#8216;X&#8217; is frequently something distinct from &#8216;kiss&#8217;, and rarely a simple representation of it. Just look at Holly Valance, whose 2002 single &#8216;<a href="http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/98969/">Kiss Kiss</a>&#8216; (and its predictably lips-obsessed <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAkUtig5iG4">video)</a> repeatedly blocks out what comes after &#8216;my&#8230;&#8217;, replacing it with a &#8216;mwah mwah&#8217; which is frequently not even mimed in the video, and, as the song progresses, gets increasingly mixed out, blanked out and fragmented.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Don&#8217;t play the games that you play<br />
&#8216;Cause you know that I won&#8217;t run away<br />
Why aren&#8217;t you asking me to stay<br />
&#8216;Cause tonight I&#8217;m gonna give you my (mwah mwah)</p>
<p>&#8211; Holly Valance, <strong>&#8216;Kiss Kiss&#8217;</strong> (2002)</p></blockquote>
<p>Where this is all leading is, of course, &#8216;tonight I&#8217;m gonna give you my XX&#8217;&#8230; which is also &#8216;my XXX&#8217;. Add to this the traditional association of mouths and vaginas (whose natural endpoint is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina_dentata">vagina dentata</a>, whence a man &#8216;always leaves diminished&#8217;) and you have a really rather porno-tastic song all round (yet one that would never come with a domain name culminating with .xxx).</p>
<h3>Basic Space</h3>
<p>By contrast, xoxo means &#8216;kiss, hug, kiss, hug&#8217; (less sexual all round) and is another way of using letters as symbols for something else – O is &#8216;hug&#8217; because it enfolds itself, yet that self-enclosure also makes it 0 = nothing. To borrow the assumptions of the seventeenth century, this &#8216;nothing&#8217; is also equivalent to &#8216;cunt&#8217;, since it is an empty space (as in Rochester&#8217;s poem &#8216;<a href="http://oldpoetry.com/opoem/show/16664-Lord-John-Wilmot-Upon-Nothing">Upon Nothing</a>&#8216;, which describes &#8216;nothing&#8217; as &#8216;a great unite<em>D What</em>&#8216; (pronounce &#8216;what&#8217; to rhyme with &#8216;cat&#8217; to get &#8216;<a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/01/31/an-alphabet-of-femininism-16-p-is-for-pussy/">pussy</a>&#8216;)). Similarly, in <strong>Hamlet</strong>, Ophelia tells the protagonist she thinks &#8216;nothing&#8217; – which, he replies, is &#8216;a pretty thought to lie between maids&#8217; legs&#8217;, and (given that &#8216;th&#8217; was frequently pronounced &#8216;t&#8217; in the sixteenth century), in the light of this you may wish to reconsider the meaning of Shakespeare&#8217;s title &#8216;Much Ado About Nothing&#8217;. There is a curious irony here in the use of &#8216;x&#8217; and &#8216;o&#8217; side by side: one crosses out and refuses, the other is &#8216;nothing&#8217; in the first place.</p>
<h3>Stars</h3>
<p>You have all been mighty patient, but here I draw towards a conclusion: <em>x </em>is a letter so many-layered as to refuse any comprehensive analysis. But this is itself quite appropriate, because those of its meanings I have looked at here all hinge around negation or deletion. That these should happen to focus around sex and (specifically) the vagina is not necessarily something intrinsic to the letter, but it certainly tells you a lot about how that letter is used. Blocked out, crossed out; rendered titillating or exciting; exclusive or exclusionary –<em> exit</em>, stage right.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center">WIDOW</h2>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ll say one thing: the war makes the most peculiar widows.</p>
<p>Rhett Butler, <strong>Gone With The Wind </strong>(1939)</p></blockquote>
<h3>Bootylicious</h3>
<p><em>Widow </em>is another Old English word, <em>widewe</em> (= widow&#8230;), which connects via the Indo-European <em>vidhava</em>, with the Latin <em>viduus</em>, meaning &#8216;bereft&#8217; or (its other lexical descendent) &#8216;void&#8217;. This &#8216;vacancy&#8217; at the etymological heart of the word seems perfect, if rather sad, since (as we all know) a widow is &#8216;a woman who has lost her husband by death and has not married again&#8217;.</p>
<div id="attachment_4526" style="width: 278px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/446px-Queen_Victoria_photographed_by_George_Washington_Wilson_1863.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4526" data-attachment-id="4526" data-permalink="/2011/03/28/an-alphabet-of-feminism-23-w-is-for-widow/446px-queen_victoria_photographed_by_george_washington_wilson_1863/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/446px-Queen_Victoria_photographed_by_George_Washington_Wilson_1863.jpg?fit=446%2C599&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="446,599" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Queen Victoria on a horse" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/446px-Queen_Victoria_photographed_by_George_Washington_Wilson_1863.jpg?fit=223%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/446px-Queen_Victoria_photographed_by_George_Washington_Wilson_1863.jpg?fit=446%2C599&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-4526 " src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/446px-Queen_Victoria_photographed_by_George_Washington_Wilson_1863.jpg?resize=268%2C359" alt="A grumpy-looking Queen Victoria, wearing black, sits on a horse with a man in a kilt holding the reins." width="268" height="359" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/446px-Queen_Victoria_photographed_by_George_Washington_Wilson_1863.jpg?w=446&amp;ssl=1 446w, https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/446px-Queen_Victoria_photographed_by_George_Washington_Wilson_1863.jpg?w=223&amp;ssl=1 223w" sizes="(max-width: 268px) 100vw, 268px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-4526" class="wp-caption-text">'The Widow at Windsor' - Queen Victoria in 1863, after Albert's death in 1861</p></div>
<p>Anyway, the emptiness immanent in the word <em>widow </em>is materially rather ironic, since, in European history at least, a lucky woman whose family had thrashed out a good <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/01/10/an-alphabet-of-femininism-13-m-is-for-marriage/">dower-deal</a> at her marriage was, in theory, entitled to most of the death-booty – as long as she didn&#8217;t marry Shakespeare and end up with the &#8216;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Hathaway_(Shakespeare)#Shakespeare.27s_Will">second best bed</a>&#8216;, or fall foul of anti-female legalities (as in Austen&#8217;s <strong>Sense and Sensibility</strong>).</p>
<p>But if we assume all has gone right and your wealthy husband has obligingly shuffled off this mortal coil and done nothing unexpected with his will, <em>widowhood </em>comes with a golden handshake. Even a little bit of money leaves you with a degree of important independence, and historical <em>widows</em> have frequently exploited this, becoming, in some instances, iconic political figures. Notable <em>widows</em> of history have included: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiang_Qing">Jiang Qing</a>, wife of Chairman Mao and leader of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang_of_Four_(China)">Gang of Four</a>; the dowager <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_de'_Medici">Catherine de Medici</a>, who machinated throughout the French Wars of Religion; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrippina_the_Younger">Agrippina the Younger</a>, super-Freudian mother of Nero; late-period <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> (dubbed &#8216;The Widow at Windsor&#8217;); <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Parr">Catherine Parr</a>, Henry VIII&#8217;s last wife (and the most married queen in English history), whose main distinction is that she &#8216;survived&#8217; &#8230; and even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacqueline_Kennedy_Onassis">Jackie Kennedy Onassis</a>, if you&#8217;re into that sort of thing.</p>
<h3>Scottish Widows</h3>
<p>On a more casual note, the independent <em>widow </em>was a culturally significant figure throughout European history, often dubbed the <strong>Merry Widow</strong>, as was the eponymous heroine of Franz Lehár&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Merry_Widow">operetta</a> (1905). Not only does Lehár&#8217;s <em>widow</em> have her own <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ5ekXKMjws">theme tune</a>, she also sparked a self-titled <a href="http://edwardianpromenade.com/fashion/the-merry-widow/">hat-craze</a>, and attentive readers will note that this &#8216;ornate or wide-brimmed hat&#8217; is worn at a <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/02/14/an-alphabet-of-femininism-18-–-r-is-for-rake/">rakish</a> angle that rather suits <em>Merry Widow</em>&#8216;s dictionary definition as a bereaved woman who is &#8216;amorous or designing&#8217;.</p>
<p>This idea goes back to the medieval age: the Scottish William Dunbar&#8217;s brilliantly phonetic poem &#8216;The Tretis of the Tua Mariit Wemen and the Wedo&#8217; features a <em>widow</em> who sits in a field telling two married women she&#8217;s found from somewhere about the comparative excellence of her own state:</p>
<blockquote><p>With him died all my dole and my dreary thoughts;<br />
Now done is my duly night, my day is upsprungen,<br />
Adieu dolour, adieu! My dainty now begins:<br />
Now am I a widow, i-wis, and well am at ease&#8230;</p>
<p>William Dunbar, <a href="http://www.thomondgate.net/pdf/Dunbar/Dunbar_3.__Tretis_of_the_Tua_Mariit_Wemen_Glossed___subheads.pdf">The Two Married Women and the Widow</a> c.1490s</p></blockquote>
<p>Anyone familiar with Chaucer&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wife_of_Bath's_Tale">Wife of Bath</a> may recognise something of Alysoun&#8217;s archness here – unlike the other Older Woman, the <em>old maid</em>, the <em>widow </em>is a legitimately sexually experienced woman, often with a bit of money, who has, in consequence, less to lose than the young <em>maiden</em>. With this licence, the medieval <em>widow </em>is frequently presented as a bawdy sexual facilitator, and she is also free herself to run riot, cause scandals, wander around unchaperoned and facilitate other people&#8217;s sexual encounters with relative impunity.</p>

<h3>Staring at the Sea</h3>
<p>Of course, it&#8217;s not all sitting in fields and enjoying your inheritance: the <em>widow</em>&#8216;s independent fortune certainly makes her a target for gold-diggers – as is the case with every <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3FZ_jtDMVg">Margaret Dumont</a> character in every Marx Brothers film ever. There are also lots of interesting cases in literature where you know the absent husband&#8217;s in trouble because the vultures are circling round his wife – Odysseus&#8217; Penelope is for a time a <em>widow </em>in the word&#8217;s second sense: &#8216;a wife separated from (or deserted by) her husband&#8217;. In addition to this, she also has to contend with house full of Suitors drinking her out of house and home on the (misguided) assumption that Odysseus is dead, rather than simply shagging Calypso on an island far, far away.</p>
<p>Penelope&#8217;s <em>widow</em>hood also lurks at the back of the North American term <em>Widow&#8217;s Walk,</em> &#8216;a railed or balustraded platform built on the roof, originally in early New England, for providing an unimpeded view of the sea&#8217;, and a highly evocative phrase suggestive of young Scarlett O&#8217;Hara-style sea-<em>widows</em>, whose British equivalents would probably have been provided for by the financial services company <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Widows">Scottish Widows</a>, first set up in 1815 as a way to provide for <a href="http://www.afoolandhismoney.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/scottishwidows.jpg">(sexy) <em>widows</em></a>, sisters and daughters whose husbands were lost in the Napoleonic Wars.</p>
<p>The Penelopean <em>widow</em> doesn&#8217;t really exist any more, but <em>widow</em>&#8216;s second meaning has a more modern significance first spotted in Late Middle English &#8211; &#8216;a wife whose husband devotes most of his time to a specified activity and is rarely at home&#8217;. Some readers may have heard the term &#8216;<em>World Cup Widow</em>&#8216; bandied about last year – other examples the dictionary gives include &#8216;<em>golf widow</em>&#8216; (sweet jeebus, get out of that one sistah&#8230;) and &#8216;<em>business widow</em>&#8216;. There&#8217;s also the more niche example of the &#8216;Secret Society Widow&#8217; – the <a href="http://www.freemasonry.london.museum/">Museum of Freemasonry</a> in Covent Garden has a rather nice clock on display that was presented to the wife of a member &#8216;in gratitude for her allowing her husband his Lodge nights&#8217;. Here there is a sense of these women as being passive blocks on enjoyment for someone else – the World Cup <em>Widow</em> is basically me moaning about having a sudden dip in loving attentions because there are men in ridiculous shorts running around on a screen in a noisy pub&#8230; Ahem. I digress.</p>
<h3>Kiss me in the shadow of a doubt</h3>
<p>Anyway, here we reach the flip-side of the <em>Merry Widow</em>, best exemplified in Alfred Hitchcock&#8217;s personal favourite of his own films, <strong>Shadow of a Doubt </strong>(1943). This features Joseph Cotton as the &#8216;Merry Widow Murderer&#8217; with a venomous attitude towards these <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEoTXa_52A0">&#8216;horrible, faded, fat, greedy women&#8217;</a> that may be extreme, but nonetheless exemplifies the idea that a <em>widow</em>&#8216;s financial independence actually renders her &#8216;useless&#8217; and a hindrance to earthly happiness (read: money) for everyone else. On this, there&#8217;s an interesting little typographic significance of <em>widow </em>first recorded in the mid-twentieth century &#8211; she is &#8216;a short last line of a page or column considered undesirable&#8217;. That is, the <em>widow </em>represents a kind of hangover, something that is surplus to requirement, and no longer neatly slotted into a clear, neat unit.</p>

<p>As well as being targets for Hitchcockian serial killers, <em>widows </em>can also adopt this role themselves of course – the <em>black widow </em>is a criminal female whose widowhood is assumed to have been – shall we say – voluntary. This phrase originates from the <em>black widow spider</em>, a venomous North American spider, especially <em>Latrodectus mactons</em>, &#8216;the female of which usually devours its mate&#8217;. A fear of female power and often source of grim fascination, this term works rather interestingly with notable Rock Widows – <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtney_Love">Courtney Love</a>, whom many genuinely accuse of having murdered Kurt Cobain; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoko_Ono">Yoko Ono</a>, who was never really a popular fave to begin with; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priscilla_Presley">Priscilla Presley</a> and even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faith_Evans">Faith Evans</a>, widow of The Notorious B.I.G. and the brains behind a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM0-ZU8njdo">dodgy reworking of The Police</a>.</p>
<p>These inevitably take on an important role as mediator of their husbands&#8217; glory, and living blocks on libel, speculation and marketing opportunities. Courtney Love famously &#8216;released&#8217; her husband&#8217;s suicide note to Nirvana fans and Yoko Ono wasted no time in putting together a posthumous Lennon album after his murder (reportedly showing up in the studio the very next day). The<a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/03/21/an-alphabet-of-feminism-22-v-is-for-vitriol/"> vitriol </a>these women have variously attracted presumably relates to a sense of the <em>widow </em>as a figure standing between fan and artist, with a hefty inheritance and a team of lawyers. It also compares curiously with the hatred or suspicion directed at many of the Political Widows with which this post began.</p>
<p>But ultimately there are as many different types of <em>widow </em>as there are <em>widows.</em> This post has attempted not so much to categorise them as to suggest a few ways people have regarded them: Jackie O (tragically graceful); political dowager (devious and suspect); the rich survivor draped in Chanel and gullibility – and a middle-aged Scottish woman sitting in a field, really quite content with her lot.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6 style="text-align: center;">V</h6>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">VITRIOL</h2>
<blockquote><p>Heaven has no rage like love to hatred turned,<br />
Nor hell a fury like a woman scorned.</p>
<p>William Congreve, <strong>The Mourning Bride </strong>(1697)</p></blockquote>
<h3>This Corrosion.</h3>
<p>Vitriol is more properly known by its scientific name: <em>sulphuric acid</em>. Or additionally, &#8216;Any of various sulphates of metallic elements, especially ferrous sulphate.&#8217; The only reason I get to do it for V is because the late c13th had a rather fanciful approach to science (no offence guys), and dubbed this chemical <em>vitriol</em>, from the Latin <em>vitreus </em>(= &#8216;of glass, glassy&#8217;). Cos, in certain states, <em>sulphuric acid </em>looks &#8216;glassy&#8217;. Geddit?? Ahem. Actually, there&#8217;s nothing whimsical about <em>vitriol </em>in its everyday life: it&#8217;s extremely corrosive (hi, GCSE Chemistry), and has an exothermic reaction with water, basically meaning it dehydrates anything it comes into contact with&#8230; but then liberates extra heat through the very process of reacting with water, causing more burns. Nasty.</p>

<p>Of course, like its sibling term <em>acid, vitriol </em>is also a lovely little example of a word whose literal and figurative meanings have almost equal prominence in modern English. Thus, around 1769, <em>vitriol </em>started meaning &#8216;Acrimonious, caustic or scathing speech, criticism or feeling&#8217; and – naturally – this sense was in figurative relation to sulphuric acid&#8217;s &#8216;corrosive&#8217; qualities. <span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 13px;">These are the same corrosive properties that made sulphuric acid every murderer&#8217;s friend throughout criminal history – every Wikipedia fan given to perverse procrastination </span>knows about John George Haigh, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_George_Haigh">Acid Bath Murderer</a>, who dissolved the bodies of his victims in a bath full of acid (but was eventually dobbed in by a couple of stray gallstones and part of a denture)&#8230; Shudder.</p>
<h3>My pain, your thrill.</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 13px;">Anyway, <em>vitriol</em> has apparently been around since ancient times, but came into prominence during the late c19th, owing to its use as a cleaning product. Of course, since it was suddenly considered fine for trying at home, it was easily purchased at your local chemist by every housewife on her weekly shop.</span></p>
<p>In this context, I&#8217;ve always thought of <em>vitriol </em>as a pendant to <em>arsenic</em>, a household poison used for pest-control, cosmetics and suicide (if you&#8217;re French, bourgeois and in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madame_Bovary">Flaubert novel</a>). Particularly suggestible Victorian women would mix this one with chalk and vinegar to improve their complexion, with occasionally fatal consequences for their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqua_Tofana">hapless spouses</a>. History is correspondingly full of tales of malevolent arsenic-armed females, including the eighteenth-century <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Blandy">Mary Blandy</a>, who put it in her father&#8217;s tea so she could marry her lover.

<p>These cases are part of a long tradition of female poisoners going back to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_de'_Medici">Catherine de Medici</a> and the Emperor Augustus&#8217; wife <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livia">Livia</a>, both politically powerful women who were the subject of (probably apocryphal) rumours of poisonous ingenuity. Livia supposedly killed Augustus by poisoning figs that were still on the tree (the last in a line of such crimes, if you like a bit of <strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yNNviQNna4">I, Claudius</a></strong>. As everyone should.) and that old gossip-monger <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandre_Dumas">Alexandre Dumas</a> describes how Catherine de Medici used to poison casual household objects – ranging from books and gloves to lipsticks – to relieve herself of Inconveniences who just happened to be breathing.</p>
<p>The logic behind this tradition seems clear enough: unaccustomed to the brutalities of war and macho posturing, the female murderer is nonetheless skilled in the arts of household management, food preparation and cosmetics. Her arsenal is correspondingly domestic, and widespread reporting of female poisoners presumably relates to a kind of fear of the unknowably deadly potential of the home (and all it represents), not to mention the oft-observed &#8216;fact&#8217; that the female of the species will tend towards silent attack, backstabbing and general wiliness when settling her battles. The <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/10/11/an-alphabet-of-femininism-2-b-is-for-bitch/">bitch</a>! Thus, like <em>vitriol</em>, <em>poison </em>too has a transferred sense: to be <em>poisonous </em>is to be &#8216;deeply malicious, malevolent&#8217; – &#8216;sly&#8217; – in a way which is almost antonymic to simple &#8216;brutality&#8217;.</p>
<h3>Don&#8217;t look back in anger.</h3>
<p>But in the late 1800s something changed, and there was an apparent epidemic of <em>vitriol throwing</em> in addition to arsenic poisoning <em>– </em>so much so, that it got its own verb: to<em> vitriolize </em>was to &#8216;throw sulphuric acid at a person with intent to injure&#8217;. Thankfully, this verb is now &#8216;rare&#8217; (although on this, see more below), but its usage was overwhelmingly nineteenth-century. Moreover, a cursory look at newspaper records reveals these were overwhelmingly perceived to be <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F60912F83F5B10738DDDAD0994D9415B8484F0D3">female crimes</a> against an <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_h3kuIb49xUU/TNFvMRldp9I/AAAAAAAAAA4/nSGw8K8PB3o/s1600/vitriol+petit+journale.jpg">erstwhile lover </a>or a rival. A &#8216;crime of passion&#8217;, in fact, in a way that poisoning (slow and subtle) is not. <a href="http://www.theatreofthedamned.com/">My pal Stewart</a> has recently started resurrecting the Parisian <strong>Grand Guignol</strong>, a Parisian theatre of horror whose depiction of acid-throwing was only one of many acts of mutilation presented onstage between 1897-1962, and <a href="http://theatredamned.blogspot.com/2010/11/violence-and-vitriol-exploring-le.html">I&#8217;m quoting him quoting Anne-Louise Shapiro</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the 1880s, vitriol began to acquire the symbolic associations traditionally linked to poison; <em>l’empoisonneuse</em> was joined by a new rhetorical (and actual) figure, the <em>vitrioleuse</em>. [&#8230;] Women who were dangerous through their very domesticity – who transformed the ordinary and the womanly into the menacing &#8211; underscored not only female duplicity but male dependency.</p>
<p>Anne-Louise Shapiro, <strong>Breaking the Codes: Female Criminality in fin-de-siecle Paris</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Guignol">Grand Guignol</a> play <strong>La Baisir dans la Nuit </strong>hinges around a disfigured acid victim exercising (literal) eye-for-an-eye revenge on the lover responsible for his wretched state. This sort of thing is perhaps to be expected in a &#8216;theatre of horror&#8217;, but <em>vitriol throwing</em> also appears in the broadly passion-free Sherlock Holmes stories, most fully in the <strong>Adventure of the Illustrious Client </strong>(1924) where the crime in question is perpetrated by a Fallen Woman on her Base Seducer – over ten years after the frequency of cases had prompted <a href="http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1908/may/27/vitriol-throwing">calls to make the purchase of vitriol more difficult</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, this &#8216;Kitty Winter&#8217; is full of <em>vitriol </em>of both kinds: as Watson puts it, &#8216;there was an intensity of hatred in her white, set face and her blazing eyes such as woman seldom and man never can attain&#8217;, and her <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/11/22/an-alphabet-of-femininism-8-h-is-for-hysteria/">hysterical</a> ranting and raving against the &#8216;instrument of her demise&#8217; is – throughout the story – placed in opposition to the calm and aristocratic air of her Don Juan&#8217;s next victim. Throughout the story it is made clear that <em>vitriol throwing </em>is the sort of thing possible only for a woman full of a special kind of fury – and, as Watson makes clear, that fury is something &#8216;man never can attain&#8217;. The lambs.</p>
<p>The interesting thing here, of course, is the transition from silent, wily domestic <em>poisons</em> to public acid attacks that hinge around the old adage that &#8216;Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned&#8217; (a misquote from Congreve <a href="http://knucklesunited.com/2010/02/hell-hath-no-fury-like-a-woman-scorned-18-pics/">that endures to this day</a>). This, of course, is a woman armed with <em>vitriol </em>of one kind or another, and the idea was clearly much-repeated, because by the mid-century we also had the word <em>vitriolic</em>, meaning&#8230; well&#8230; &#8216;like vitriol&#8217;. That said, it is frequently unclear whether this is <em>vitriol </em>in a literal or figurative sense: in 1919 the Sarah Palin of the nineteenth century, Mary Kilbreth (President of the American National Association to Oppose Woman Suffrage), questioned Emmeline Pankhurst&#8217;s patriotism on the grounds that Pankhurst and the Suffragettes had led a &#8216;reign of terror&#8217; that involved &#8216;<a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MnMF_H5V9qwC&amp;pg=PA318&amp;lpg=PA318&amp;dq=vitriol+throwing+suffragette&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TrY7MuJE6R&amp;sig=_wUynt426C-mYWwGp59pEsdUdbE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mCODTeFXhc6EB5blkK4E&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=vitriol&amp;f=false">bombs, kerosene and <em>vitriol</em> throwing</a>&#8216;, but whether she meant words or household cleaner remains tantalisingly unclear.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, for many around the world today <em>vitriol </em>is all too literal. This article has been interested in exploring the criminal female in history but – in the UK and abroad – acid attacks are still common, particularly (but not exclusively) as part of a culture of &#8216;honour violence&#8217; directed against women. While it would be disingenuous to suggest exclusivity on either side, it does seem that these are increasingly male-on-female attacks in contrast to the apparent gender-split in the nineteenth century. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/dec/24/acid-attack-victims-honour-violence">This article</a> has a rather good summary of the current situation, and recommends places you can find out more, including the<a href="http://www.acidviolence.org/"> Acid Survivors Trust</a>.<a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/V-is-for-Vitriol-e1300624545993.jpg"><br />

Henry VIII, after Holbein.</p></div>
<p><em> </em><em> </em><em> </em><em>Uterus </em>derives from a Latin homonym meaning &#8216;womb&#8217; or &#8216;belly&#8217;, with reference to the proto-Indo European<em> udero </em>(= &#8216;abdomen&#8217;), and, possibly, a Slavic usage, <em>vedro</em>, meaning &#8216;bucket&#8217;. Much like the &#8216;bucket&#8217; (and indeed the shape of the letter <em>u </em>with which the word commences), the first sense of <em>uterus </em>is as a vessel &#8211; &#8216;the organ in which the young are conceived, developed and protected till birth; the female organ of gestation; the womb&#8217;.</p>
<p>Much has been made of this &#8216;protective&#8217; element – it has been frequently observed that the &#8216;fetal&#8217; position babies adopt to fill the <em>uterus</em> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_position">endures into adulthood as a comforting or even instinctual reaction</a> to anxiety, pain, distress or cold – a kind of retrospective communion with the mother&#8217;s body. This sort of thing, it seems, <a href="http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/41427293/ns/today-todaytravel/">is not above a bit of marketing</a>, and the <em>uterus </em>is often invoked as a place of calm, darkness and peace.</p>
<p>Opposed to this, we have the sort of ambiguity nowhere better demonstrated than through tanks. (yes, tanks). The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_I_tank">Mark I </a>tank, the world&#8217;s first combat tank, was renamed from &#8216;Big Willie&#8217; to &#8216;Mother&#8217; (&#8230;), and its successors were colloquially dubbed &#8216;Mother&#8217; throughout both world wars. The reasons are obvious: the inside of a tank is small, hot and protective. Childlike, a crew could be forgiven for considering themselves invincible within it – yet once the fuel tank is hit, the men inside suffer a hideous, incestuous death, incinerated by their own machine. This sort of thing runs right the way through conceptions of the mother&#8217;s body, particularly in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis">psychoanalysis</a>, which is never tired of exposing the deeply conflictual nature of many mother-child relationships, and with mapping those onto the cisgendered female body – we might think particularly of Melanie Klein&#8217;s famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splitting_(psychology)#Melanie_Klein">&#8216;good breast&#8217; and &#8216;bad breast&#8217;</a>. If we&#8217;re going there.</p>
<p>HOWEVER. BACK TO THE RENAISSANCE. In its early incarnations in English this &#8216;womb&#8217; is rarely so clearly gendered (<a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/11/22/an-alphabet-of-femininism-8-h-is-for-hysteria/">as you may remember</a>, King Lear thinks he has one), and, true to its ambiguous etymology, early modern minds frequently considered the <em>uterus </em>to be a generic bodily pouch. Thus it was often conflated with the gender-neutral <em>belly </em>(ah, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isidore_of_Seville">Isidore of Seville</a>), and in this form it was thought to be proof of the body&#8217;s retentive faculties. So even when considered as a specifically reproductive organ, the thinking went, the <em>uterus </em>still resembles the digestive system in how long it takes to do its business, since it creates <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/11/29/an-alphabet-of-femininism-9-i-is-for-infant/">infants</a> over a leisurely period of nine months. While I doubt it takes quite that long for your morning Alpen, digestion is certainly something of a gradual process – consider, if you will, the hangover.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold;">Horn of Plenty</span></p>
<p>If you remember the Alphabet post on <em><a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/01/24/an-alphabet-of-femininism-15-o-is-for-ovary/">ovary</a> </em>(to which this is in many ways a companion), you may also remember that until the seventeenth century sex organs were considered to have analogues across the genders (penis = vagina, labia = foreskin and uterus = scrotum). Along with its reproductive and sack-like qualities – I am reminded of the beautifully named &#8216;<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/media/images/38102000/jpg/_38102498_babies_ap.jpg">Mermaid&#8217;s Purses</a>&#8216; – in this model the <em>uterus </em>also matches the <em>scrotum </em>in its creative properties. After all, reproduction is six of one and half-a-dozen of the other.</p>
<p>But this was not just something tossed around in the Renaissance lab and subsequently ignored: the scrotum-uterus comparison actually spread into what we might consider a bizarre arena – fashion. I am, of course, talking about the <em>codpiece</em>, &#8216;a bagged appendage to the front of the breeches; often conspicuous&#8217;. This was a sartorial fave of Henry VIII (above, right), who clearly took his outfits very seriously – but I note that sexy <a href="http://www.odt.co.nz/files/story/2009/10/jonathan_rhys_meyers_as_henry_viii_in_the_tudors_w_1666626344.jpg">Jonathan Rhys Meyers</a> has avoided the sexy codpiece throughout the BBC&#8217;s <strong><a href="http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2OTc2MTIwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjkwNTQ3._V1._SX450_SY600_.jpg">Sexy Tudors</a></strong>. Too sexy?</p>
<p>Originally a modesty device to get round the, ahem, &#8216;shortcomings&#8217; of the hose, this strange appendage quickly grew to a size that redefined it as a disturbing kind of hyper-masculine power-dressing. Yet the word derives from the Old English <em>codd </em>(<em>+ piece</em>), which came to mean &#8216;testicles&#8217; in early Medieval times (quite possibly because of exactly this phenomenon) but originally meant simply &#8216;a bag, pouch or husk&#8217;. Indeed, the <em>codpiece </em>was frequently dubbed a <em>belly</em>, and, through fun with synonyms, the <em>womb </em>could become a <em>cod</em>: my good friend <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Making-Sex-Gender-Greeks-Freud/dp/0674543556">Thomas Laqueur</a> highlights the Pardoner&#8217;s exclamation &#8216;O wombe!

<p>So it seems that, while Henry VII might not thank you for it, we could observe that this most macho of garments is in fact drawing attention to the womb-like, generative, and retentive properties of what lurks within (which, of course, it also helped <em>protect </em>– gender-ambiguous Russian dolls, anyone?). Indeed, glancing at a couple of examples in portraiture, a <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_cpToIwY89Rc/S2CrnJLOSBI/AAAAAAAACAI/GCIi1nDDr80/s320/codpiece12_full.jpg">lot of these men</a> look rather like they have an <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_scczN8MdyKw/SSrrk14KNCI/AAAAAAAADE4/3cRnlccIumw/s400/Unknown+Man+D.jpg">artificially constructed <em>uterus </em></a>poised <a href="http://ty.rannosaur.us/wp-content/uploads/edwardvi.png">over their genitalia</a> (<a href="http://themurkyfringe.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/codpiece1.jpg">love how he&#8217;s pointing, just in case we miss it</a>). Less Blackadder, more&#8230; actually, I don&#8217;t know <em>what </em>that is.</p>
<h3>Bag for Life</h3>
<p>But, of course, eventually someone had to seize on anatomical differences to posit a definition of gender, and thus it that (around 1615) the <em>uterus </em>started to be considered something exclusively female – as regular readers will be aware, this was a chain that began with independent naming of the organ in question and eventually reached the pitches of <em><a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/11/22/an-alphabet-of-femininism-8-h-is-for-hysteria/">hysteria</a> </em>in the nineteenth century. There is also a strange quasi-legal term, <em>uterine</em>, apparently first spotted in the seventeenth century but not dictionary-cited until 1816, meaning &#8216;related through the mother&#8217;. Thus, &#8216;the property devolves to his brothers or uterine uncles&#8217;, with the body of the mother here serving a dynastic link, since all these uncles can be proved to have shared a uterus. They could even be half-brothers, since an alternative meaning for <em>uterine </em>is &#8216;having the same mother, but not the same father&#8217;. Working on a similar premise, if you are particularly toolish, and your sister has a son, you would (in pre-paternity test times) have been best off leaving your money to your nephew: his link to you is purely <em>uterine</em>, unlike your link to your son, who could be anyone&#8217;s spawn.</p>
<p>As we draw near the end of the Alphabet series, threads begin to resolve themselves. <em>Uterus </em>has been the final word of three (<em>hysteria </em>and <em>ovary </em>were the other two)<em> </em>all of which address the issue of mapping the cisgendered female body. Following the three, we have seen a model of sex and gender that does not conform with what many experience as the current status quo. Conversely, the distinction between genders does not seem to have been primarily based on the body until the nineteenth century (or even later). Thus, we have seen <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XR2BcRwiG-sC&amp;pg=PA127&amp;lpg=PA127&amp;dq=marie+germain+montaigne&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wUFyuQjNb2&amp;sig=ljtQ1Xb5-TMH8RfJfyae_XtbgGg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=plY8TYLHBpGYhQeqjJGxCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=marie%20germain%20montaigne&amp;f=false">women turning into men</a> with comparatively little contemporary comment, the female orgasm (and in some cases her entire sexual appetite) <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/10/11/an-alphabet-of-femininism-2-b-is-for-bitch/">vanish from the everyday realities of heterosexual sex</a>, and now, and perhaps most bizarrely, an epidemic of hyper-masculine men apparently walking around with giant <em>uteri </em>affixed over their genitalia. (Yes, I did just say &#8216;uteri&#8217;). Perhaps this is worth thinking about&#8230;</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">TEA</h2>
<blockquote><p>Make tea, child, said my kind mamma. Sit by me, love, and make tea.</p>
<p>Samuel Richardson, <strong>Clarissa </strong>(1747)</p></blockquote>
<p>Ah, the Joke Post comes upon us at last. T is for &#8216;t&#8217;&#8230; very droll. I lift a cup to that. But fie! Have we learned nothing on this lexical journey? First and foremost, <em>tea </em>was not always pronounced as we currently say it: when it first appeared in English in 1601 it was <em>&#8216;taaaaay</em>&#8216; and often written <em>tay </em>(like the modern French <em>thé</em>, a bit). It is not quite clear when and why the shift to &#8216;ti&#8217; happened, but, then, few things are as easy to lose sight of as pronunciation (how many people remember that Keats was a Cockney?)</p>

<p><em>Tea</em>, of course, has the additional complication that it is not an English word (although what is?) – it came from the Dutch <em>thee</em>, in turn from Malay and, eventually, Chinese Amoy dialect: <em>t&#8217;e</em>, or the Mandarin <em>ch&#8217;a. </em>Woven into the geographical etymology, then, is a legacy of import history: around the mid-seventeenth century we procured our tea from the Dutch, who imported it from Malaysia and, ultimately, China. What exactly were they importing? Why, <em>tea</em>&#8216;s first definition, of course: &#8216;the leaves of the tea-plant, usually in a dried and prepared state for making the drink&#8217;. In this form,<em> tea</em> began with a queen, and quickly became every eighteenth-century Cosmo girl&#8217;s first route of seduction.</p>
<h3>Brew and Thunder.</h3>
<p>But first &#8211; the drink. &#8216;Made by infusing these leaves in boiling water, having a somewhat bitter and aromatic flavour, and acting as a moderate stimulant&#8217; &#8211; in this sense, the word <em>tea </em>is first recorded around 1601, so some trendsetters must have been aware of it before the widespread importing of the later seventeenth century, when <em>tea </em>really came into its own: Samuel Pepys tried it in 1660, and a couple of years later it found a celebrity backer in the <a href="http://www.oceansbridge.com/paintings/museums/national-portrait-gallery/Catherine-of-Braganza.jpg">be-farthingaled</a> shape of the Portuguese queen consort to Charles II, Catherine of Braganza (<a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/01/10/an-alphabet-of-femininism-13-m-is-for-marriage/">remember her</a>?). So, in England at least, <em>tea </em>was from the beginning tending towards the female of the species.</p>
<p>Catherine&#8217;s tea-drinking was partly to do with Portugal&#8217;s colonial links with Asia, but also with her <a href="http://www.britannia.com/history/biographies/catherine_braganza.html">temperament</a>: solemn and pious, she initially had trouble fitting into the Protestant English court and her preference for a &#8216;moderate stimulant&#8217; over the ales and beers otherwise drunk marked one of many departures. But <em>tea </em>was quickly owning its stimulating qualities and being marketed as a &#8216;tonic&#8217;, a civilized alternative to alcohol capable of soothing aches&#8217;n&#8217;pains and spurring on mental capacities: a zeitgeist for the intellectual impetus of the early Enlightenment &#8211; as against Charles II&#8217;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2kyNbZc7oc">well-known debauchery</a> &#8211; and, in fact, a &#8216;<a href="http://hunch.com/asterix-characters/falbala-panacea/2760474/">panacea</a>&#8216;:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hail, Queen of Plants, Pride of <strong>Elysian </strong>Bow&#8217;rs!<br />
How shall we speak thy complicated Powr&#8217;s?<br />
Thou wondrous <strong>Panacea</strong>, to asswage<br />
The Calentures of Youth&#8217;s fermenting rage,<br />
And animate the freezing veins of age.</p>
<p>Nahum Tate, from <strong>Panacea: A Poem Upon Tea </strong>(1700)</p></blockquote>
<p>But what started out as a Portuguese import became a matter of English national identity, and by the next century London&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company">East India Company </a>had established a monopoly on trade, controlling imports into Britain (and thus, prices), using its extensive trade links with Queen Catherine&#8217;s dowry –then-Bombay – and the East Indies, and Asia. It was thus that the English turned not into a nation of coffee drinkers, but to devotees of the &#8216;Queen of Plants&#8217;. And a queen she certainly was, and not entirely distinct from the maternal and oft-secluded <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne,_Queen_of_Great_Britain">Queen Anne</a>, who dramatically reduced the size of the English court and inspired a new fashion for calm domesticity and politeness. Thus, the bustling male-dominated <a href="http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd's_of_London#Formation">coffee-houses</a>, but also a more feminine fix at home&#8230;</p>
<h3>Five Leaves Left.</h3>
<p>So in 1738 <em>tea </em>came to mean not just some withered leaf, but also an opportunity for socialising! Hurrah! To be precise, <em>tea </em>became &#8216;a meal or social entertainment at which tea is served; especially an ordinary afternoon or evening meal, at which the usual beverage is tea&#8217;. The fact that it could connote an &#8216;ordinary afternoon meal&#8217; made <em>tea </em>a convenient beverage to offer casual social callers, although it was also, of course, a beverage that demanded a whole host of conspicuous purchases: a full tea-set and the crucial Other Element – sugar. Thus your tea-table represented Britain&#8217;s colonial interests off in China and India to the tea-side, and Africa and the East Indies to the sugar-side, with all the attendant horrors of the emergent slave trade conveniently swept under the (Persian) rug.</p>

Photo par Hodge.</p></div>
<p>The conspicuous consumption <em>tea </em>represented was exacerbated by its price: before mass importation in the mid-century had driven costs down, the leaf itself was fixed at so extortionate a price (a bargain in 1680 was 30s a pound) as to necessitate the purchase of a lockable tea-chest, which would become the responsibility first of the lady of the house, and, when age-appropriate, of her daughter. The woman who held the key to the tea-chest was, naturally, also the woman who made the tea &#8211; thus &#8216;Shall I be mother?&#8217;, a phrase of uncertain origin. One theory I came across was that it is a Victorian idiom related to the phenomenon of women unable to breastfeed naturally using teapot spouts to convey milk to their infant instead. OH THE SYMBOLISM.</p>
<p>Whatever the phrase&#8217;s specific origins, it&#8217;s certainly true that from <em>tea</em>&#8216;s domestic beginnings onwards whole family power structures could hang on which woman this &#8216;mother&#8217; was. Alas, London&#8217;s major galleries forbid image reproduction (WAAH), but if you turn to <a href="http://images.npg.org.uk/790_500/9/2/mw08292.jpg">your handouts</a>,  you will see this in action. This is the Tyers family: that&#8217;s Mr Tyers on the left, and his son just down from one of the universities. His daughter, on the far right, is about to be married (she&#8217;s putting her gloves on to go out &#8211; out of the door and out of the family). Her role as tea-maker has, in consequence, passed onto her younger sister, who now sits as squarely in the middle of the family portrait as she does in the family sphere. Conversely, in <strong>Clarissa</strong>, when the heroine angers her parents they sack her from her tea-task and grotesquely divide it up among other family members (&#8220;My heart was up at my mouth. I did not know what to do with myself&#8221;, she recalls, distraught. I WANTED TO MAKE TEA!).</p>
<h3>And she feeds you tea and oranges&#8230;</h3>
<p>Of course, while assigning the tea-making to your daughter could be a loving gesture of trust, it also pimped her marriageability: it requires a cool head and calm demeanour to remember five-plus milk&#8217;n&#8217;sugar preferences, judge the strength of the tea and pour it, all the while making small-talk and remaining attentive to your guests. Add to this the weighty responsibility of locking the tea away from thieving servants and you have the management skills of housewifery in miniature. It also showed off physical charms: poise, posture, the elegant turn of a wrist, a beautifully framed bosom.
