Oh -- and &quot;kitchenette&quot;.  I think that &quot;kitchenette&quot; chiefly flourished as a word in the 1950s and 1960s.  Small new-build flats, or large Victorian houses newly divided into flats, often had tiny kitchens.  No doubt a &quot;kitchenette&quot; (which once sounded bright and modern) made a flat more saleable than a &quot;poky little kitchen&quot;... although the two mean much the same.

The kitchen, of course, has traditionally been taken as a women&#039;s preserve, and I think kitchenettes were mostly intended for the use of women.  There may be more than a trace of the female sense (as in &quot;usherette&quot;) with &quot;kitchenette&quot;.

These days, celebrity male chefs have claimed kitchens for the male sex.  But the likes of Gordon Ramsey and Jamie Oliver need elbow room.  I don&#039;t readily imagine them cooped up in a kitchenette.

On another tack, Jamie Oliver forms an interesting example of an &quot;ie&quot; diminutive used by a man.  Perhaps this is especially interesting in view of your writing:  &quot;I remember once reading an article in Cosmo or one of its cognates arguing that the best way to spice up your lovelife is to adopt a ‘-ie’ nickname (so Kirstie, not Kirsty).&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2010/11/08/an-alphabet-of-femininism-6-f-is-for-female/#comment-266&quot;&gt;Hodge&lt;/a&gt;.

You mention page three girls being called &#039;Sam&#039; (and Ms Fox comes immediately to mind) but &#039;Sam&#039; is a unisex diminutive, and could equally be Samantha or Samuel.  Diminutives ending in &quot;i&quot;, &quot;ie&quot; or &quot;y&quot; are especially interesting, I think.  Nicola, for example, can equally become Nicki, Nickie, Nicky or Niki (and maybe others with the same pronunciation).  Nicolas, by contrast, is likely to become Nick.  In other cases, &quot;i&quot; or &quot;ie&quot; is usually female, while &quot;y&quot; is usually male.  Theresa, for example, is likely to become Terri or perhaps Terrie, while Terrance is apt to become Terry.  While Bobby Shafto (in the old song) is evidently male &quot;silver buckles on his knee&quot;, Bobbi Shafto would certainly be female.  In fact, Robert Shafto was a real man of the eighteenth century, but were he alive now he&#039;d be much more likely to be Bob than Bobby.  I can&#039;t recall meeting a man styled as &quot;Bobby&quot;.  These days, I think, Bobby has joined Nicky in its application by sex -- so that Bobbi, Bobbie and Bobby would probably all be women.  I suspect that the last couple of hundred years has seen a move move away from &quot;y&quot; diminutives for males.  My impression is that Charlie was once specifically male (Charlie Chaplin, Charlie Chan) but is so no longer.  Perhaps it is currently (like Sam) unisex.  I suppose that, for men (Charles), Charlie is not really a diminutive at all -- turning a one syllable name into two syllables.  Charlie has the same number of syllables as Charlotte, but seems less of a mouthful.  I&#039;m not sure where this takes us, but I find myself fascinated by sex-specific and unisex diminutives, not least when they display shifting usage.  Curious signifiers of femaleness and maleness which (I suspect) pass generally unnoticed.]]></description>

&#039;Male&#039; is apparently also a diminutive: from &#039;masculus&#039;, dim. of &#039;mas&#039; (male), so they are paired  in that sense. Given that, I suppose the diminutive here is less problematic. 

My real interest in the diminutive thing goes back to &#039;doll&#039;, I  guess, and the use of nicknames in particular. I remember once reading an article in Cosmo or one of its cognates arguing that the best way to spice up your lovelife is to adopt a &#039;-ie&#039; nickname (so Kirstie, not Kirsty). Apparently this makes you sound fun lovin&#039;, and I suppose it has a very similar root to what you&#039;re talking about with the -ette: you don&#039;t really want to think about where that ends up, do you?

And when are page three girls ever called anything other than &#039;Sam&#039;, &#039;Nicki&#039;, &#039;Charlie&#039; etc? That&#039;s not what their grandmothers call them. 
Alas, I have never seen a &#039;Kitchennette&#039; in the news in briefs. One day, maybe.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My favourite feminine rhyme comes from a poem written by a man, and concerning two men (not much else feminine, here)...   &quot;The Two Old Bachelors&quot; by Edward Lear:

&#039;You earnest Sage!&#039; aloud they cried, your book you&#039;ve read enough in! -
We wish to chop you into bits and mix you into Stuffin&#039;!&#039; -

Enough in/Stuffin&#039; -- brilliant!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Diminutives do keep popping up.  An interesting example is the suffix -ette, which has three distinct meanings:

1) Female e.g. usherette.

2) Small (= diminutive) e.g. kitchenette.

3) Imitation e.g. leatherette.

The last of those seems to have the most offensive possible implications regarding women.]]></description>
