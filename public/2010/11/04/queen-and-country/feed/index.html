					<description><![CDATA[I started reading Queen &amp; Country right back in the beginning, and it was one of my favourite series. Unfortunately monetary issues meant I couldn&#039;t pick up regular comic books anymore. 

But I think I&#039;m going to go collect the trades now. Thanks for reminding me that this awesome story was out there.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One of the things which makes this such a suspenseful series is that (like Spooks, although this is the only way they overlap) Greg Rucka really will kill title characters in the second episode and not care. No-one is safe :)

I think Rucka is a superb writer of women. He even managed to write a run of a character who has sometimes slipped easily into violence-porn barbie for boys - &quot;Elektra&quot;, and make her a detailed and deserving main character with no sexism (it&#039;s actually one of my favourite graphic novels: &quot;Everything old is new again&quot;). Interestingly, Elektra&#039;s sensei (and the strongest, most capable person) in that run is also female.]]></description>
