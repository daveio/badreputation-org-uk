The salary level you would judge to be &quot;about right&quot; is significantly higher than what a woman with comparable skills and experience would think is about right (&#039;you&#039; being not actually you, of course, but a typical male candidate with your skills and experience). I certainly wouldn&#039;t stretch it to say that everyone has a glass ceiling, but I do acknowledge that classism, racism, ableism and other institutionalised discriminationatory practices and attitudes also have their parts to play in making that ceiling a lot lower for some qualified candidates.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am a - wait a sec.

*checks*

I am a man, and I have occasionally been put off applying for jobs because the salary is too high. In fact, salary is probably the central method I use to determine if a job is about &quot;my level&quot;, as if that term has any real meaning.  I guess this just shows that you can put glass ceilings on yourself regardless of your gender.  This article has made me start to rethink the way that I look for work.  So, um, go feminism?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Interesting stuff - I know I&#039;ve definitely been put off applying for jobs before because the salary seemed too high. Which is a ridiculous reason really, but that&#039;s the magic of gender socialisation!]]></description>
