I&#039;ve been thinking that, properly to consider &quot;girl&quot; applied to an adult woman, we need also to take into account &quot;boy&quot; applied to adult men.  I&#039;ve thought of six such uses of &quot;boy&quot;, but there are probably more.  I don&#039;t where this takes us, but...

1. Boy = adult African American.  A patronising (at best) American usage, possibly now obsolete.  We find it in: &quot;Pardon me, boy, is this the Chattanooga Choo-choo?&quot;  I&#039;m pretty sure that the question is supposed to be addressed to a black railway employee.  There seems an implication that a boy is less than a man (and, by extension, we may assume that a girl is less than a woman).  As far as I know, &quot;girl&quot; has not been used in a similar way for adult African Americans.

2. &quot;Good old boy&quot;, an other American usage.  My impression is that &quot;good old boy&quot; and &quot;red neck&quot; mean pretty well the same thing.  If one dislikes rustic Americans one may call them red necks, using &quot;good old boys&quot; implies the opposite attitude.  Here &quot;boy&quot; seems to be affectionate.

3. In English usage the &quot;old boys&quot; of a school (former pupils).  For once (thank the goddess) this seems sexually neutral.  &quot;Old girls&quot; is used in exactly the same way.

4. Another English usage for &quot;old boy&quot; (possibly regional) = elderly man.  My mother used &quot;old boy&quot; in this way, seemingly affectionately, but perhaps a little patronisingly.  I think that this usage was (is? I haven&#039;t heard it recently) employed more by women than men.  My father certainly used it on occasion, but more sparingly than my mother.

5. Boyfriend = a man with whom one has a sexual (or potentially sexual) relationship short of intending to spend ones&#039; entire remaining lives together.  I have heard the word used of men in their thirties (at least).  Again, sexually neutral, &quot;girlfriend&quot; is used in the same way.

6. Boys = soldiers or policemen (the latter as &quot;the boys in blue&quot;).  &quot;Support our boys&quot; means &quot;support our army&quot; without any reference to the age of the soldiers (although only staff officers are permitted to remain the army until they become geriatric).  I think the sense of &quot;our boys&quot; is that these (as a nation) are our sons.  &quot;Boy&quot;, here, perhaps signifies a familial relationship more than it does anything to do with the age of the boys.  I am uncertain as to the mix between senses 4 and 6 in the &quot;Dad&#039;s Army&quot; signature tune: &quot;We are the boys who will make you think again&quot;.

All of this seems to paint a rather confusing picture of the word &quot;boy&quot;, but perhaps we should try to make some sense of it, if we are to give serious attention to the word &quot;girl&quot;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2010/11/15/an-alphabet-of-femininism-7-g-is-for-girl/#comment-272&quot;&gt;Pet Jeffery&lt;/a&gt;.

Don&#039;t forget &#039;female&#039;, which, while rarely used in everyday conversation nowadays, has been firmly relegated to the realms of the straightforwardly opprobrious.

One of the problems with &#039;girl&#039; is that, I think, it also cuts into the heart of the preoccupation with youth, and fear of maturity, which, while not necessarily an exclusively feminist issue, certainly has some serious implications for women.

Here, I think it is worth returning once again to the nickname issue, and perhaps throwing in the slightly strange habit many women have of speaking in fake dialect / accents when they&#039;re saying something a bit controversial or unexpected (on this, see Hadley Freeman, for example - http://bit.ly/ceElr3). This to me seems to be an attempt to sort of belittle yourself in order to avoid confrontation or challenges. 

In the same way, while there may be a kind of fear in growing older (I still find it hard to remember I&#039;m no longer a teenager, even though I&#039;ve been in my twenties for a couple of years now, and stubbornly continue to refer to myself as &#039;a girl&#039; because I simply can&#039;t get my head around the idea that I&#039;ve finally arrived in the realms of &#039;women&#039;), I think there is also something about *refusing* to own your maturity which is more of an issue than it would be for a man. No man my age would submit to being called &#039;a boy&#039;, for example. 

And don&#039;t forget that one of the oft-cited reasons behind eating disorders (those most female of mental illnesses) has been a desire to remain a child, to refuse a developing body and all the pitfalls it represents. Which are often based around sexuality. 

Apologies if this is long and rambling. I hope it makes some kind of sense!]]></description>

Would comment on what W will be, except my brain only works short-term and I genuinely can&#039;t remember if I had a witty and interesting curveball for that week or not ;) Will have to check my tatty sketchbook word-list. 

I will, however, be addressing the rather interesting question of women / witches and their familiars when we get to P. Which word will be possibly the most grindingly obvious gynocentricism of them all...]]></description>

Interesting factoid on the women (and men) who were accused of being witches during the big &#039;witch trial&#039; period in Europe: they were mostly middle-aged people who had political power and disputes with their neighbours. Some crossover with women who were considered to be too &#039;nagging&#039; as well. There&#039;s an interesting vein that suggests it was often used in a sexist way where &#039;bitch&#039; might be today.

Whereas when the choice of woman is driven by reports of what a witch DOES (historical documents of accusations, not fairy-tale version), it&#039;s often young and beautiful women stealing other people&#039;s boyfriends. Or old crones with curses. Less middle ground, as you said above.]]></description>
