That&#039;s exactly what I was interested in: emancipation in the US was a formal proclamation that actually achieved pretty much nothing in real terms. We often have to look carefully at what such legal freedoms actually mean.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am interested to note that, eleven days after posting, &quot;Emancipate&quot; has attracted comments from nobody but me.

The more I think about &quot;Emancipate&quot; the more I am struck by the passivity of the concept.  One is emancipated by another person&#039;s act.  One can liberate oneself, but not (I think) emancipate oneself.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The &quot;man&quot; of &quot;emancipate&quot; is taken from &quot;manus&quot; = &quot;hand&quot;, not from the word &quot;man&quot;.  But I wonder how distinct these two are in practice.  I used to work in a large warehouse that had foremen and charge hands.  The sense of &quot;men&quot; in &quot;foremen&quot; and &quot;hands&quot; in &quot;charge hands&quot; seems to be very much the same.  A &quot;hand&quot; can also be a man.  All of the foremen and charge hands, incidentally, actually were men, not women.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The idea of &quot;Emancipate&quot; seems to be of sudden release -- of opening the hand to let go.  And yet, in reality, attaining freedom and/or equality is a more gradual and complex process. The act of emancipation can often be more illusory than real.  In a country in which women and slaves have supposedly been emancipated, women and girls are trafficked for sexual purposes.]]></description>
