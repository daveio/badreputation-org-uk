I think maybe there&#039;s an interesting wider trend in here somewhere about how women are filmed when they do action sequences or violence. I remember &#039;graf looking at Salt for this site and commenting that the camera rarely pointed at what the heroine was doing, choosing instead to focus on *her* face at moments of gore. Compare Craig&#039;s Bond, where we see the effect of his actions as well as the act. 

I still haven&#039;t seen RED, because when around half the team went I stayed home to do some site admin here! Might have to get the DVD.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One of the things that made me saddest is that while Helen Mirren was undeniably badass, the film shied away from showing her actually kill anybody.  I don&#039;t remember whether she mows anyone down during the climax, but Bruce Willis, John Malkovich and Morgan Freeman all shoot someone in the face at points in the movie, and in Helen Mirren&#039;s sniper rifle scene, she just gives covering fire - she even misses Karl Urban when he&#039;s dead in her sights.  Maybe she&#039;s just giving covering fire, but it felt like squeamishness on the director&#039;s part to me.

However, my wife and I came out of the film beaming - it&#039;s so much fun!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[But the fact that Ivan rescues Victoria is an important and sweet part of their love story and rekindling their romance.  I know &quot;man saves woman&quot; is a cliche but lots of story tropes we now recognise as cliches are reused over and over and aren&#039;t necessarily &quot;bad&quot;. The success is in the delivery and for my part I don&#039;t really feel that in this particular instance it was unfeminist or poorly done. I thought it was sweet and romantic.

Well, as romantic as you can get whilst one partner is bleeding to death from a bullet wound.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll admit, I was one of the people who cheered when Helen was swept off her feet, because I&#039;m a helpless romantic and the context was awesome - here she was, the BAMFest BAMF in the whole world, cutting through gunman after gunman (and did you notice her formal &#039;dress&#039; was actually trousers), and taking a bullet for the cause because she&#039;s fearless, and just when she&#039;s prepping herself up to face the enivtable, she&#039;s swept off her feet by the love of her life. I&#039;m a total sucker for twilight romances, and given their history and all the forces that had been keeping them apart, and the sheer goddamn chemistry between them, that was the crowning moment of the movie for me.

OTOH, I spent half the movie waiting for Morgan Freeman&#039;s inevitable return to the fold. I mean, come on: with the first death fake out, and the irrelevance of his second &quot;death&quot;, and the fact that no one admitted to shooting him - there&#039;s no possible narrative way he could actually be dead.

Right?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2010/11/23/at-the-movies-red/#comment-348&quot;&gt;Miranda&lt;/a&gt;.

Yes, basically.

(Spoilers for the comic comin&#039; up:)

1) There is no relationship between Paul (Frank) and Sally (Sarah) - or rather there is, but it&#039;s not a romantic one.
2) The comic is not a comedy. It&#039;s a three issue short story about Paul being the baddest badass who ever badassed.]]></description>

Yes, ugh.  I was genuinely surprised at that particular turn around.  I mean, yes, he does save her life when she&#039;s drugged, but that&#039;s really not enough, is it, to counterbalance the fact that he literally kidnapped her with little-to-no explanation at the beginning.

So, so sad at Inevitable Dead Black Dude.  MORGAN, WHY.  MORGAN, I LOVE YOU, MORGAN.

So yes.  I should, really, have mentioned those things.  But I was too busy with my GLEE TUBE.

GLEE TUBE.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am reliably informed by fans of the comic that the film is wildly different from it to the point that some fans have commented &quot;they barely needed to buy the rights to the comic, they could have named it something else and NO ONE WOULD KNOW!&quot;, since it diverges so wildly.  I wonder if the relationship is handled better there? Or... if there even *is* a relationship? I seem to remember being told that the comic is very much Frank-as-loner, without a team, so Victoria doesn&#039;t even exist, that Sarah&#039;s in it but much less so, and that it&#039;s quite, quite darker than the film.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yes - this, all of it, really; although...

When I first saw the film (and I should hasten to add that in general my impression is of OVERWHELMING GLEE AND AWESOME and I am still SPECTACULARLY EXCITED and Warren Ellis has bought his daughter a pony with the money from this film, did you know that? A PONY) I was disturbed - and I am still disturbed - by the abusive-turned-&quot;fluffy&quot; nature of the relationship between Frank and Sarah. I don&#039;t think the transition from &quot;kidnapper&quot; to &quot;lover&quot; was handled as elegantly and it could have been and it leaves a slightly bitter taste in my mouth.

I mean, &quot;You can&#039;t just go around duct-taping people&quot; - but - what consequences does the film show for kidnapping of a young woman? She falls into his arms...

Oh, and Inevitable Dead Black Dude, of course. :(

BUT. Those things aside. THIS IS AN AWESOME MOVIE. And anything is going to have flaws. And it still does lots of things better than anything anywhere else ever. HELEN MIRREN. MACHINE GUN.]]></description>
