&quot;No man my age would submit to being called ‘a boy’, for example.&quot;

Actually, I&#039;ve found plenty don&#039;t care, as long as they can still call me a girl. They would only take offense at a MAN calling them a boy.]]></description>

Yeah. I&#039;m counting it as one of the Alphabet&#039;s successes that, as I&#039;m going through, I find the same sort of issues coming back time after time, and thus creating a space for discussion and dialogue about them from lots of different angles. I really hope this is something everyone can engage in.

I&#039;m also sort of mentally pairing words up - with luck, by the end there&#039;ll be a series of different linguistic approaches to several key feminist issues - social, medical, legal, sartorial, sexual, familial etc: infant and girl are obvious allies, but so too, I hope, will be Hysteria, U and O; X and J; S and N... but that&#039;s all a secret :)]]></description>

So, the sense is that the more infantile women are the lovelier they are?  Has anybody written that the more articulate and assertive women are the lovelier they are?]]></description>

I had problems with this too. I think the key is that &#039;she&#039;s&#039; is being used as a noun - &#039;the loveliest she&#039; = &#039;the loveliest woman&#039;. So then the &#039;she&#039;s&#039; must be &#039;[woman] is&#039; and I assumed that &#039;express&#039;d&#039; meant &#039;described as&#039; or &#039;resembling&#039;. &#039;And still the more she lives and knows&#039; - &#039;despite the unavoidable knowledge you acquire simply by existing&#039;, &#039;the loveliest [type of?] woman is still like a child&#039;. I think. 

But I am happy to bow to any superior knowledge, cos it doesn&#039;t *quite* sound perfect...]]></description>

Ha. That&#039;s funny - in the first draft I had the exact same example: &#039;flammable&#039; was one of my granddad&#039;s pet hates. Sadly had to be removed for reasons of space....]]></description>
