					<description><![CDATA[Your quotation ‘O me, my heart! My rising heart! But down!’ reminded me of Spell 30B of the Egyptian Book of the Dead:

O heart of my mother,
O heart of my mother,
O heart of my transformations:

Do not rise up against me as a witness,
Do not oppose me in the tribunal,
Do not be hostile to me before the guardian of the scales]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love the idea of The Magic Flute as the apogee of Enlightenment rationality - it&#039;s so patently the product of a borderline insane mind. 

I think there has to be a case made for the institutionalisation of hysteria as a product of the Enlightenment&#039;s recurring dichotomy between rational and responsible middle-class white civilised man vs emotional and unstable woman/savage/child/working-class/anyone else. &#039;Green sickness&#039; and pre-Enlightenment perception of women&#039;s health centres around physical ailments, around the time hysteria kicks off it all becomes about delicate nervous systems and the like.

Just my vague ideas anyway...]]></description>
