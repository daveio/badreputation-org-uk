					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2010/11/24/a-minister-for-women-id-prefer-silly-walks-thanks/#comment-373&quot;&gt;Sarah Jackson&lt;/a&gt;.

I think this is a very good point. 

I love Ainsley, but I think a lot of her positions are only workable for her because she&#039;s lucky enough to, for example, be able to *afford* to go to law school, have both her parents (whom the pay gap hasn&#039;t had an adverse effect on) input financially into her education, and so on. 

On the other hand, with the current incumbent, pages like this (http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2010/05/12/analysis-how-pro-gay-is-the-new-home-secretary-and-minister-for-equality-theresa-may/ ) don&#039;t help.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Whatever shape the govt equalities remit takes I think there should be some level of specific representation for women, to provide a check on the development of gender neutral policies and services. They *sound* good but can mean women are worse off - I was at a thing yesterday where Helena Kennedy made this point much better than I can, though I think I might be mangling her phrase a bit: &quot;Equality isn&#039;t simply treating as equal people that aren&#039;t.&quot; 

The Women&#039;s Resource Centre ran a great campaign which explains more about why we need a women&#039;s sector as well as gender equality lobby:  http://www.wrc.org.uk/what_we_do/campaigns/why_women/default.aspx]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure why Ainsley says she doesn&#039;t need her rights handed to her by old white men and then invokes article 14 to make her point. Republican doublethink, anyone?

WG - you do or you don&#039;t think we should have a Minister for Women? I think we should have one. I&#039;ve got no problems with the next one being a man for a change, although it does put me in mind of this Onion article -  http://www.theonion.com/articles/man-finally-put-in-charge-of-struggling-feminist-m,2338/]]></description>
