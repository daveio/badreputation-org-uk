					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2010/12/08/feminist-self-defence/#comment-396&quot;&gt;Franz&lt;/a&gt;.

I had a chat with some of the other BadRep guys recently, and mentioned that I&#039;ve done some martial arts when this topic came up. I did quit Ninjutsu because I&#039;m just not evil enough (in the same way you describe, Franz!) and I know what people mean about most classes being too focused on learning an art instead of defence.

Steve&#039;s feminist self-defense class syallabus, weeks 1-20: The Testicles.

But yeah, what really impressed me from people&#039;s reports of this one was the emphasis on space, awareness, dealing with panic etc. and not wasting time on the &quot;don&#039;t put yourself in that situation&quot; rubbish. This is all much more important than wristlocks...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I went to a similar session run by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.londoncentreforpersonalsafety.org.uk/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;London Centre for Personal Safety&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.feminisminlondon.org.uk/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;FIL10&lt;/a&gt;. It was absolutely awesome; ours was a two hour session and although we learnt a lot of &quot;moves&quot; as it were in the second hour, the first hour was all about personal space and how you can empower yourself to react when someone gets in yours.

What was really nice was that after the session I went and spoke to the woman who was running the workshop, because with my social phobia my personal space is a hell of a lot smaller than most people&#039;s tends to be. She gave some great advice about how to handle my anxiety and I felt really confident that if something did happen, I&#039;d have all this knowledge there to help me and that I would be able to use it.]]></description>

To an extent that probably depends on the art. There&#039;s a vast gulf in practicality between a sport style like Tai Kwon Do and something like Krav Maga. Krav Maga probably does require being a bit of a sociopath to actually use in self defence though, since you&#039;re probably going to cripple someone which generally is something people are averse to doing even in defense.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2010/12/08/feminist-self-defence/#comment-394&quot;&gt;Russell&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks for the fab post, Jenni! As wonderful as being involved with Ladyfest Ten was, I really feel like I missed out some fab classes and workshops being being involved elsewhere, so it&#039;s great to get the lowdown from someone who was there. 

I think Russell&#039;s right that the aspect of training for competitions or to pass exams and get to the next &#039;level&#039; of a martial art really does detract from the valuable skills that would serve you well in the real world.

For years when walking alone at night (I know they all tell you not to do it, but when it gets dark at 4pm in winter, short of having a chaperone to escort me to and from work, I don&#039;t have much choice!), I walk with my keys between my fingers (a tip from my Mum, who when she was a student was attacked by a would-be mugger - she scraped his knuckles with her keys and kicked him the bollocks, and he soon scarpered). I mentioned this at a one self-defence class when asked what we do if attacked, and the attitude was very judgemental and dismissive - not ideal in a situation like you say could well be traumatic or upsetting...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One thing that&#039;s struck me as a bloke about all the so-called &quot;self-defence&quot; classes I&#039;ve attended is actually how useless or overly specific they tend to be.  I attended a class recently to watch and see if I&#039;d be interested, and the moves being taught were more like dance moves than anything else.  I&#039;m sorry but if someone is coming at me with a knife then I&#039;m not going to wait until the last possible moment to slap their hand in just the right place to make them drop it, I&#039;m going to (a) run or (b) hit their arm or wherever I can reach as hard as possible to give me a chance to get away.

It&#039;s heartening to learn that there are self-defence classes which exist which teach people, be they men or women, actual practical skills for taking care of themselves which don&#039;t include altering their behaviour (living in fear).  Too often I fear so-called martial arts and self-defence classes are focused on training for competitions and not on the actual practical aspect of having to look after yourself.]]></description>
