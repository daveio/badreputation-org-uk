Hey wererogue,

Thanks for that - much appreciated and great links. When I put &lt;i&gt;in order to &quot;win&quot; the female must &quot;lose&quot;&lt;/i&gt; I was thinking in terms of mf sexual-social relationships, the stereotype of the woman submitting to the overpowering dominance of the man. What I wanted to say, and perhaps did not express myself especially clearly, was that those sorts of relationships can be damaging for both parties because they express sexual relationships as a permanent and non-negotiated (non-consensual) power-exchange which is normalised, and in many instances, validated and supported, by mainstream societal prejudices and media. The whole &quot;ug caveman!&quot; thing.

Yes, women also could be seen as competing for alphas, which isn&#039;t something I touched on much in the article, although female/female competition is an issue I do want to write about.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2010/12/15/alpha-malaise/#comment-321&quot;&gt;Rob&lt;/a&gt;.

There&#039;s a great interview about the (non-) existence of Alpha males among Wolves in nature here: http://drsophiayin.com/videos/alphawolf.m4v
From an excellent article about the folly of dominance methods of training dogs, here: http://drsophiayin.com/philosophy/dominance/

I really like this article, and support its message and intent.  The one phrase I&#039;d dispute is &quot;In order to “win” the female must “lose”&quot; - as I understand it, the woman is also competing for a high-status mate.  But our societal ideas of status (including &quot;Alpha&quot;-status) are really messed up (prizing features that don&#039;t provide value equally) which means that the competition is too, especially in a society that supposedly values emotional connection over biological imperative.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2010/12/15/alpha-malaise/#comment-321&quot;&gt;Rob&lt;/a&gt;.

Love this article, S. Especially the conclusion.

As Rob mentioned animals, I&#039;m mention something I&#039;ve been thinking about for a while...

I really want to do a post on gender as it relates to animals and humans. So much of our &#039;common knowledge&#039; about the animal world is wrong, and/or interpreted through the eyes of a patriarchal society. Just this week a guy tried to tell me about how &#039;scientists observed monkeys inventing prostitution&#039;. Feck off. Sounds like some scientists don&#039;t know what the term &#039;anthropomorphism&#039; means.

See, some see lion prides and think &#039;oh hey look, the females do all the work and the &#039;alpha male&#039; gets to sit at home and have sex with lots of females, it&#039;d be great to be a male lion&#039; like the lion with the mane is a guy whose many wives keep him and bring him his dinner in front of the TV every night. Truth - no-one would want to be born a male lion. They have very little chance in the world, thrown out of the pride before they mature, many of them die, some never find a pride... whereas the female get to live with their family group and chase and kill furry things (er, cats LIKE to do this).

Also, compare the way we view, say, a queen bee, where we almost view HER as a victim, being made &#039;fat&#039; and pregnant all the time. Er... what&#039;s the difference between her and the lion, (both the waited-upon sole sexually active member of their group who take no part in childcare) except that we as humans seem to believe that females don&#039;t like to have sex...

Also the people who imagine that dominant men are &#039;monkey&#039; men have clearly just decided to ignore the matriarchal primates out there!

And don&#039;t forget matriarchal elephants, dolphins, hyenas, killer whales, buffalo and horses, there goes &#039;stallion&#039; as a synonym for &#039;alpha male,&#039; then...

Possibly some kind of pun on the animal &#039;kingdom&#039; or &#039;kings&#039; of the jungle&#039;, for a BadRep series. Hmm.

Feel silly doing it though as most of my knowledge about animals comes from books I had as a kid and watching animal shows on TV... anyone know any friendly zoologists?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Interestingly, the whole alpha concept mostly seems tied to wolf packs when people think of alpha animals in nature, but they don&#039;t actually have anything like that heirarchical structure naturally. If I remember some old books right, wolves only do the whole alpha thing when they&#039;re held in captivity and not allowed to walk away from each other; in the wild they live in family units and bud off to form new groups instead of squabbling over dominance.

So yes, the alpha male concept is a mistake in animals too, arising from us messing with their lifestyles.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am very proud to not be an Alpha-male! I&#039;m hardly the strong and silent type, more the round and laughing type. Added to that, I work in a profession where asserting dominance over your colleagues means that people might die (I&#039;m training as a nurse) and I have no interest in being the alpha male or anything else of my social group. 

The fact that there is a strong &quot;male dynamic&quot; that wants us to be Alphas is disturbing, as you rightly wrote above. I find it more disturbing that so many men want to believe in this ideal, not realising that it&#039;s the characteristics found in the victims, not the bullies, that will ultimately come out on top. I &lt;i&gt;think&lt;/i&gt; it was Glee&#039;s Kurt who told bullies &quot;one day you will all work for me&quot; just before being thrown in a dumpster. For some reason men still think that to be the bigger man is a literal, not metaphorical, term.]]></description>
