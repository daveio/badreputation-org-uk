					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s weird. I&#039;ve now seen Jessie J&#039;s more recent &quot;Do It Like A Dude&quot; and the sentiment is definitely the same.  But Jessie doesn&#039;t emulate male dress in the video, and the &quot;dude like&quot; dancing definitely has as much winding and grinding in it as possible. Which is fine, except that she doesn&#039;t look at all like she&#039;s doing it like a dude. Her backing dancers play more games with the body language and clothes than she actually does. So it&#039;s an odd one - I think the video sort of doesn&#039;t really know what it wants.  

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOf3kYtwASo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Here&#039;s the vid for the interested!&lt;/a&gt;

Mind you, on the other side of the coin, it&#039;s got the following: 

* women starting fights in a non-prurient way
* she has some amazing lip make up going on in some of the shots - spiky black rhinestones. She&#039;s definitely rocking an aggressively spiky femininity in the vid, even if she&#039;s not doing the same thing Ciara&#039;s done
* there are these shots of hocks of meat, which I assume is some sort of knowing comment...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think this video dovetails nicely with Jamelia&#039;s hit from a few years back, &quot;See It In A Boy&#039;s Eyes&quot;. The vid for that is set in a barracks. And possibly also Beyonce&#039;s &quot;If I Were A Boy&quot;. But I&#039;ve only got dim memories of the videos and the dance sequences in this one are brilliant.]]></description>
