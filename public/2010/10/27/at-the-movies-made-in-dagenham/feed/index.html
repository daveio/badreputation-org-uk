					<description><![CDATA[YOU SHOULD ALSO SEE THIS FILM BECAUSE:

Apparently they give an individual credit to *all* the musicians on the score - it&#039;s pretty much unheard of (even the orchestral contractor is often missed off) and shows a degree of respect for a group of workers in film who&#039;re often overlooked.

YOU SHOULD ALSO, ALSO SEE THIS FILM BECAUSE:

I know even full time Union Officials who thought the film was great and showed sensitivity for the subject matter.

(Ok, I admit I&#039;m biased on both these points)]]></description>
