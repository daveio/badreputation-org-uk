					<description><![CDATA[Don&#039;t you think you&#039;re over-reacting a bit? 

And although I think he&#039;s joking, I also think that he&#039;s not totally wrong. Whether due to society, the &quot;classical&quot; role of women or female needs, I&#039;m fairly convinced that often women are prepared to do quite a lot to have or stay in a relationship...even, believe it or not, &quot;pay&quot; with sex. I&#039;m not saying that this also means they are in a happy relationship. 
As for enjoying or liking sex..I think we can agree that we do like it, but many of us with different expectations or under different circumstances than men.]]></description>

Hmm, can&#039;t reply to your other reply for some reason but yes, having now more than skim-read (that&#039;ll teach me) I can see he does go on a bit.

I&#039;d picked up his use of the word &#039;relationship&#039; but seeing him go on to &#039;boyfriend&#039; and &#039;commitment&#039; I can see your point exactly.

Be interested to hear how the whole article goes.

With you on throwaway comments and context - I have to be so careful at work my writing style has meant some people assuming I&#039;m a generation older!]]></description>

Yeah, I had a grandad who&#039;d say stupid things like this. (&quot;What do you want to educate those girls for?&quot;) 

Did he mean it? Maybe he was being ironic, or funny, or maybe he would have responded to criticism after a while, but regardless, the other grandfather was still our favourite.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The line that gets me (whether he&#039;s joking or not) is the idea that women could have had cruising areas if they&#039;d come out and said they wanted them in the past.

Er... sure. Because women have always been allowed sexual independence with no fuss or opposition from men. &quot;We want somewhere we can find a stranger to hook up with for the night?&quot; There&#039;d have been fucking riots.]]></description>

Hmmmm. Coming back the next day after doing a bit of brow furrow!

The more I re-read Fry&#039;s quotes the more I think he was probably chortling with Attitude over tea, made some silly we&#039;re-so-rad asides, and that was that.  Magazines like to quote the most polemical bits of any discussion.  And the way it&#039;s quoted, what he says is faintly ludicrous, and does sound like someone who&#039;s grown used to pontificating sweepingly with a humourous intent as his shtick. Lazy humour, but now that I&#039;ve reflected a bit, we shouldn&#039;t boil him in the cauldron of our mighty rage unless he is on BBC news blanket-stating this stuff to News At Ten. I think we have better things to focus on, in fact. 

I might try and see if Attitude is on sale anywhere near me and see if I can read the piece itself - I think Alasdair has a point, and not having the source also really bothers me. 

I&#039;m just thinking what would happen if the BR team were interviewed one day and one of us made a ribald joke that looked terrible in print, with the wrong framing. We&#039;d be so screwed. 

On the other hand, as asides go, it reads as a silly one that goes on for several lines. The humour is lazy. The generalisations are yawnsome. But he&#039;s been flippant about ladies in comedy before too, on QI, if memory serves; this should not come as a great shock. 

I would be interested to read the original context, now that I&#039;ve gotten over my &quot;WUH?&quot; reaction.
