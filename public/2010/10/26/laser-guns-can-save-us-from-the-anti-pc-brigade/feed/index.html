You&#039;re probably missing Andre Norton :) But then, the ambiguous name was deliberate because she expected prejudice against a female author... other two were Ursula Le Guin (neverending love for that woman) and Anne McCaffrey.

Yes, used to be only 6 max in a decade, changed now because the &quot;must still be alive&quot; rule was narrowing the field. To be honest, they&#039;re only just past the stage of honouring the giants of modern SF, which certainly were mostly men (and Ursula).]]></description>

I can only see two women&#039;s names?

Also, worth noting that it was less than one award per year in the early days which would further narrow the field.]]></description>

It&#039;s &lt;em&gt;&quot;an award given by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America. It is awarded to a living author for lifetime achievement in science fiction and/or fantasy.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;

27 given since 1975, but since they&#039;re *lifetime* awards, the winners are heavily skewed by those who were around in the 50&#039;s and 60&#039;s (mostly men). Also to do with having an impact on the whole genre, so getting ANY women on there has been an achievement. 3 places (even if it&#039;s only 1/9 the recipients) means that women are an integral part of sci-fi&#039;s history.

Full list here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damon_Knight_Memorial_Grand_Master_Award

All of which is different to the argument about the &quot;Mammoth Book of...&quot; because the &lt;strong&gt;short&lt;/strong&gt; story field is much more equal. Fair enough women found it hard to win awards in the early days when Asimov, Heinlein and Clarke etc were all over it, but *short* fiction doesn&#039;t have the same landscape at all.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sci-fi Rookie Editor Question! 

... What is a Sci Fi Grandmaster? How d&#039;you get to become one? How many are there in the world? Is 3 a good number for female representation (as in, are there 6 in total, or 106?)

Okay, that was four questions. Oops. 

But I am genuinely interested to know, because I know sweet FA about most sci-fi! I could google it, but maybe there are Other Rookies reading. :)]]></description>
