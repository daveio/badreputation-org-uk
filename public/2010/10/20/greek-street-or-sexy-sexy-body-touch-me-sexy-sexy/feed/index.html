					<description><![CDATA[Why do comic/graphic novel writers always make the occupation of a woman, that of a stripper? Why? Women do other jobs besides stripping and/or prostitution. A whole variety of jobs. And most of us don&#039;t have tiny waists and massive breasts either. is it because these graphic novels are aimed at a largely male readership who find it difficult to form relationships with real, normal women? 

You have to wonder.]]></description>

The Sandman &#039;Death&#039; stories are excellent, with &quot;Death: The High Cost of Living&quot; being some of the best stuff Gaiman has ever done. And all of Sandman is a must-read really, especially from Season of Mists onwards :)]]></description>

Yes, the sisters are great! And I think Snow White in particular is pretty kickass. And Goldilocks too, now I think about it. 

Though it bugs me how the fact that two characters have had sex while under a spell and don&#039;t remember it is brushed aside pretty casually, as is (of course) the possibility of abortion in the pregnancy which inevitably follows. I imagine finding yourself pregnant by a colleague after sex that you don&#039;t even remember would be reasonably traumatic but that isn&#039;t really explored. I didn&#039;t know anything about the author before, but that&#039;s interesting... 

Miranda, you should def read The Kindly Ones if you haven&#039;t already - it has the Furies in being excellent.]]></description>

The way they take Rose Red later, around the time of the war in the Homelands is kind of disappointing though. &quot;You thought you were an interesting character? Hah! No, you&#039;re just a drama-loving bimbo who&#039;ll jump into bed with the most exciting man you can find at any given moment.&quot;]]></description>

Fables is an odd one. It&#039;s gone on for far too long now and split into too many spin off series. But the first few GNs are great! Esp. when they focus on Snow White and Rose, I love the relationship between the two sisters.

I&#039;d have to re-read it to properly rec it as BR-friendly, though. The author perturbs me, he&#039;s a Republican who&#039;s argued that superhero comics these days are &#039;too liberal and un-American&#039;. Riiiight. Shouldn&#039;t judge a work by its author, but I wonder what messages I&#039;d pick up from Fables if I knew more about American politics?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Is Fables any good on gender? I keep thinking of getting into it.  

I like the small amount of Sandman I&#039;ve read (basically for Death, but I am admittedly under-read on it!), and I do enjoy The Unwritten (there&#039;s only about one female character in it who actually recurs, so far, but I&#039;ve only read Vol.1 which is very much from the point of view of Tom. And it&#039;s based partly on the Harry Potter phenomenon so I can&#039;t really fault that so far, I think).  ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This sounds v disappointing. It&#039;s not like Greek tragedy is exactly *lacking* in sex and violence in the first place, surely it&#039;s unnecessary to slop a lot more over the top in such a crass way. Guess it all fell out from the &#039;Greek Street ... that&#039;s like... Greek!&#039; idea.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really love the &quot;Memetic Hazard Stories&quot; theme!  I don&#039;t think it&#039;s tired at all.  It&#039;s something I could happily see explored again and again from all kinds of different angles and approaches and never get bored.

If I read the back of this, for example, I&#039;d be well up for it.  Greek myths! :D  But it&#039;s shite, isn&#039;t it?  It&#039;s not new or different or even bodily variant.  Disappointing.  Someone who loves Greek mythology and likes drawing monsters should do another, better, less sexist version.

... :D]]></description>
