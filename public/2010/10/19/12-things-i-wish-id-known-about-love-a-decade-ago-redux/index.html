<div class="entry clear">
<p>Ripping the piss out of women’s magazines and their litany of “get thin! buy shoes! value yourself for <em>you</em>!” instruction is a fond feminist past-time. But in the spirit of investigative journalism / having nothing better to do I decided to find out if it was possible to extract any useful advice from them.</p>
<p>It’s buried beneath a ton of heteronormative guff of course, and qualified with asides that stab at your gendersense, but I believe it is possible to extract nuggets of common sense from the pages of glossy fashion shoots and ‘What is your spirit handbag?’ quizzes.</p>
<p>So, here is my attempt to rework “12 Things I Wish I’d Known About Love A Decade Ago”, which featured in a recent issue of a popular women’s mag.</p>
<div id="attachment_266" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/paper-hearts-2.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-266" data-attachment-id="266" data-permalink="/2010/10/19/12-things-i-wish-id-known-about-love-a-decade-ago-redux/paper-hearts-2/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/paper-hearts-2.png?fit=590%2C136&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="590,136" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Cut-out paper hearts" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/paper-hearts-2.png?fit=300%2C69&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/paper-hearts-2.png?fit=590%2C136&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-266" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/paper-hearts-2.png?resize=590%2C136" alt="Cut-out paper hearts, picture from http://morguefile.com" width="590" height="136" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/paper-hearts-2.png?w=590&amp;ssl=1 590w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/paper-hearts-2.png?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/paper-hearts-2.png?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>

<blockquote>
<p>1) Never underestimate the importance of being ‘interesting’.</p>
<p>You owe it to yourself (and the men you date) to have a life of your own. So find some hobbies. In my mid-twenties, I made a guy my hobby. When he dumped me, partly because he felt smothered, I had to get a life… Now, when I’m on a date and I read the menu in an Italian accent, or I smile when I talk about my ballet class, guys really eat it up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I say:</p>
<p>Never underestimate the importance of being interesting.</p>
<p>Sigh. Where do I even start with this one? Don’t be interesting for ‘the men you date’, be interesting for the sake of the rest of humanity. It’ll be better for you too, I promise &#8211; it irritates me when I think of all the hours I spent a decade ago trying to look beautiful when I could have been doing things I actually enjoyed instead. Being interesting lasts longer than beauty and it will win you friends as well as lovers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2) There’s a fine line between teasing a man and criticising him.</p>
<p>I used to fall into this bad habit of extreme flirting by teasing. One time, I told an older guy who’d had a skiing accident that he was ‘damaged goods’, and I’d need to trade him in for a ‘younger model’. He looked at me like I’d just kicked his puppy…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I say:</p>
<p>There’s a fine line between teasing someone and criticising them.</p>
<p>I can see the sense of this one, I’ve fallen into a similar habit myself. The right kind of teasing is plenty fun of course, but if you’re in any kind of relationship with someone then the very least you can do is be careful with their feelings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>3) You will probably never fully understand men. So just try to understand yourself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I say:</p>
<p>You will probably never fully understand people. But try to understand yourself.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re feeling up to it you can try and imagine what someone may be thinking or feeling. And if you’re ready for Advanced Interpersonal Skills you can even ask them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>4) Knowing how to cook: helpful.</p>
<p>I see now that it would have won me points. When I was 21, I said to my flatmate, “I’ve bought a bag of tortellini. How do I boil water?” She told me “Make it bubble.” And, for years, that was all I knew how to do. If I’d had any idea how much men savour a woman who cooks – even if they’re great cooks themselves – I would’ve asked for more tips.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I say:</p>
<p>Knowing how to cook more than the author of this article did at 21: essential.</p>
<p>OK, EVERYONE who is physically and mentally capable of doing so should know how to boil water. Not so men can ‘savour’ it, but so you have some basic life skills. Jeez.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>5) Your wants and needs are just as important as his.</p>
<p>And if you don’t express them because you think that doing so will scare him away, then you’re saying you don’t count as much as he does.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I say:</p>
<p>Your wants and needs are just as important as your partner’s (or partners’)</p>
<p>And if you don’t express them because you think that doing so will scare them away, then you’re saying you don’t count as much as they do.</p>
<p>(See what I did there? Fun with pronouns!)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>6) We see what we want to see (and ignore the bad signs)</p>
<p>It’s… possible to convince yourself that a guy who is acting distant and cold is doing so because he’s overwhelmed by love. But he isn’t; he’s acting distant and cold because he is distant and cold. Wish I’d known that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I say:</p>
<p>We see what we want to see (and ignore the bad signs)</p>
<p>True, I think. You can convince yourself of virtually anything if you want it badly enough, or the truth is too painful to admit. In my experience you will go on believing it until something shakes you out of it but that’s not very advice-y. So, um: try and be honest with yourself and get a second opinion from someone you trust. And eat lots of fruit and veg.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>7) Things change once you’re naked.</p>
<p>This one truly would have changed my life if I’d known it back when I started having sex: sleeping with him doesn’t give you power. It’s not sleeping with him that does. Power to decide how quickly things happen; power to make him want you desperately; power to keep your clothes on if you so choose.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I say:</p>
<p>Have sex when everyone involved is ready.</p>
<p>… whether that’s after you’ve been married for 20 years or 30 seconds after you lock eyes across a crowded bus stop. And if you don’t feel you have a say in how quickly things happen, or that you can choose to keep your clothes on, then dear god don’t sleep with this person (unless it’s in that ‘ooh I fancy you so much I’ve lost control but actually I haven’t really’ way). Those things are up to you anyway, you don’t need to bargain for them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>8) Being worshipped isn’t all that.</p>
<p>You’ll go nuts if he’s absolutely devoted. So let him have a boys’ night or throw himself into work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I say:</p>
<p>Being worshipped can get pretty boring. Unless that’s your thing.</p>
<p>Once all your insecurities have been soothed by someone who adores your every atom you’ll probably find it gets dull having someone who will never challenge you. Though of course if you’re looking for a slave then hey, have fun.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>9) How much men will talk about marriage.</p>
<p>I’ve heard hypothetical wedding plans from several men I’ve been involved with – sometimes on the first date! Yet I’ve never been married. Why do guys tease so? Simple: even honest men like to tell you what they think you want to hear… So don’t indulge in wedding daydreams; it’s not worth the clouded perspective.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I say:</p>
<p>If you want to get married then wait til you find someone you actually want to marry and ask them. If they say yes they probably want to marry you as well. If you can’t find anyone you want to marry that wants to marry you then I would recommend not getting married.</p>
<p>Got that? Can we stop discussing it now?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>10) Don’t be cynical.</p>
<p>These days, I try not to roll my eyes at Public Displays of Affection, or join ‘all men are crap’ conversations. Bitterness is unattractive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I say:</p>
<p>Be realistic. Don’t be sexist.</p>
<p>Don’t join ‘all men are crap’ conversations. They’re as stupid as ‘all women are crap’ conversations and they won’t fix anything. And I wouldn’t worry about faking mindless cheery optimism all the time lest eligible men think you’re a poisonous old hag &#8211; turns out plenty of people don’t mind bitterness and in fact it can become a satisfying shared hobby.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>11) Sometimes, guys flirt with you because it makes them feel good about themselves.</p>
<p>(Hey, we do it too.) This is also the ‘aha!’ explanation for the men who asked for your number but didn’t call. Idiots.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I say:</p>
<p>Sometimes people flirt because it makes them feel good about themselves.</p>
<p>In other news: sometimes people don’t mean what they say. If they are wearing a Slytherin scarf or an eye-patch you should be particularly careful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>12) Don’t compare yourself to your friends.</p>
<p>Some of them will settle down before you. Mine have been getting married steadily for the past decade. At some point, I started to feel different, and that was a new and uncomfortable feeling for me. Rather than get anxious about it, I’ve tried to remind myself that it’s not a race. Even if you’ve always been first in buying a flat or landing your dream career, you could be the last in marrying.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I say:</p>
<p>Don’t compare yourself to your friends, or to people on TV, in Tesco or in women’s magazines.</p>
<p>Because you’re different people, remember? They have this habit of doing different things, at different times and for different reasons. And more importantly, beware of women’s magazine articles that insinuate that marriage is the goal of everyone’s life, and that if there are no nuptial omens in your tea leaves then you should feel anxious. Bullshit.</p>

<p>Particularly agree with 1. My favourite nugget of Oscar Wilde wisdom &#8211; &#8220;Genius lasts longer than beauty &#8211; that&#8217;s why we take such great pains to overeducate ourselves&#8221; ;-)</p>
<p>I think writers of women&#8217;s magazines may start with what you said an back-translate into sentences that make more money? Just trying to see the best in people ;-)</p>

<p>Oh yes I think they do. It wasn&#8217;t meant to be a dig at the author of the article (except on the cooking thing &#8211; I mean, wow) I reckon there are a lot of sensible writers who turn out this stuff because they need to earn a crust. And there is some good advice in there, so I guess I should be grateful that some of it gets through.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s enough seeing the best in people for me, think I may have to go and have a lie down ;-)</p>

<p>I like this advice. I find it particularly relevant. I suppose that makes it a successful non gendered set of relationship advices. I do find #12 troubling though, mainly because I feel a lot of pressure; as a graduate working in a **** job, and as someone with body issues. I need to work on #12 but its not easy for me.</p>
<p>Great post. Way to stick it to cosmo et al.</p>

<p>Surely no. 9 contradicts no. 10? Of their list I mean, because I know plenty of guys who are all about looking for the one and having the dream wedding and really do mean it.</p>
<p>Re no. 2 I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d know how to flirt without being incredibly rude and harsh to people (the trick is to never say anything that could be mistaken for true). Actually this is how I treat all my closest friends. I guess my rule would be &#8220;the more you can treat a partner like a best friend, the more likely it is that your relationship will work&#8221; Just don&#8217;t replace any actual best friends in the process.</p>
<p>No. 1 is one of the most upsetting &#8211; even putting the word interesting in inverted commas as if you don&#8217;t really have to mean it, it&#8217;s just put on for show. It would be cool to make up a different set of points on this theme, like &#8220;don&#8217;t give up any of your own hobbies, activities or support networks &#8211; you&#8217;ll be bored and you&#8217;ll get sick of spending all your time with one person&#8221; and stuff.</p>

<p>Much of this is good advice (yours, not Cosmo&#8217;s). Number 10 is my favourite. Shared bitterness is my personal #1 criterion in a man/woman. So far I can&#8217;t vouch for it as a basis for a lasting relationship leading to impending nuptials, but it has certainly improved the (clearly substandard) relationships that I have experienced.</p>

<p>Thanks! Glad to hear of other people taking up bitterness as a shared hobby. It&#8217;s cheaper than ballroom dancing classes at any rate, and you can get together with other couples and be bitter together over a nice dinner. Lovely!</p>

<p>Yay, fun with pronouns!</p>
<p>I think the idea behind no.3 is the most pernicious. Both genders of magazine seem utterly devoted to the idea that men/women are an unknowable other and you must spend money on glossy bullet-pointed lists of decoding strategies to have a chance of unravelling the mystery.</p>
<p>What is he thinking when he does this ostensibly banal thing!? What does she REALLY want when she says she wants this other thing? Read our top ten tips for understanding eyebrow movement! Buy our wallchart of ways to get people into bed using psychic-ninja-body symmetry!!!</p>

<p>Cosmo has an extensive &#8220;man section&#8221; in which &#8220;real men&#8221; (not, like, Real Men exclusively in the Beef-Football-Porn sense&#8230; just any men who they&#8217;ve amazingly shipped over from Mars to get that precious insight into their minds) tell you what they &#8220;really think&#8221;. Because, obviously, this will enlighten you as to how all men think, and thus give you the skills to successfully negotiate your relationship with any of the interchangeable mysterious beings. This will be a far better strategy than asking any of the men you meet what they think about any of these issues (&#8220;do all men really want a threesome?&#8221;), because&#8230; you should always expect men to lie to you? (I don&#8217;t actually read Cosmo that much. It&#8217;s just that sometimes people buy a copy and I can&#8217;t help but look. Like the Daily Mail website.)</p>
<p>Of course, I find everyone an unknowable other. Even you. But that&#8217;s a separate issue&#8230;</p>

<p>Hmm&#8230; personally, I find bitterness unattractive. In women, in men, in people I respect and people I don&#8217;t respect, in prospective partners, taboo partners and people of no interest to me romantically. I just don&#8217;t like bitterness. But I suppose that&#8217;s me personally.</p>

<p>I vary &#8211; I like the occasional bit of sarky humour and self-awareness, but I don&#8217;t particularly like cynicism for cynicism&#8217;s sake.</p>
<p>This is because I am an unapologetically gregarious dork. I like being able to go to the zoo with someone and shout, &#8220;WOW! LOOK AT THE HIPPO! :D&#8221; without anyone going &#8220;uh, whatever&#8221;.</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t think Sarah J would advocate THAT sort of bitterness either. Because that sort of bitterness doesn&#8217;t lend itself to getting anything done, so it&#8217;s not very conducive to activism of many kinds, I think :)</p>

<p>Yeah, was just meaning that if you are bitter then you&#8217;re probably better off finding someone who doesn&#8217;t mind (or wants to join in :-) than pretending you aren&#8217;t to seem more attractive.</p>
