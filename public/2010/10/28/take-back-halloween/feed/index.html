I thought that pumpkin outfit was absolutely wonderful. You looked  fabulous.

Two male friends of mine decided to be Sith Cheerleaders a couple of Halloweens ago. That was pretty cool. It wasn&#039;t as over-the-top as they were hoping, though, because they just couldn&#039;t *find* any spandex-y male-sized cheerleader gear in the shops (one of them was on a trip to the US, and had a look)! So they made their own with black t-shirts and red duct tape. :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I personally adore the Mrs Potato Head one and would wear that for Halloween at the drop of a hat. 

I read an alternate view (and I can&#039;t remember where, soz) that said that Halloween was the one time that women got to dress up in slutty outfits yet not be called a slut, and so therefore it was freeing. Not sure I totally agree but sometimes, I can see that people with good bodies (not me, I went as a pumpkin last year because I am short, round and owned orange tights) may want to show it off without men thinking that they are hookers and women getting jealous.

Well, ok, that might happen anyway on Halloween, but at least they have an excuse, right?

Whatevs, I&#039;m off to buy the sexy Chinese takeout outfit. Gotta love an outfit that comes with a cookie as a hat.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The good people of Twitter also sent us these: 

* NEYTIRI! FROM AVATAR! Wears, um, stilettos for Halloween. http://avatarmoviecostume.net/neytiri-costume.php 

In the mighty jungle, indeed. D:

* Mrs Potato Head! Should not be too round! Wear a bodycon minidress with a giant face on it, instead! 

http://www.yandy.com/Mrs.-Potato-Head-Costume.php

Very Katy Perry. 

I actually think the second one is so quirky I kind of like it. In a really wrong way. But if I wore it the eyes would be right on my boobs, which, well. Bit terrifying.  But NEYTIRI. WHAT IS SHE DOING IN HEELS. THAT MAKES NO SENSE. AND I DO NOT EVEN LIKE AVATAR. ]]></description>
