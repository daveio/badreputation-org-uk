					<description><![CDATA[You allude to the idea that women are more physical, men more spiritual.  This curious idea, I suppose, still plays out in all the fuss about women bishops.  (There was a recent news story about an entire Church of England parish going over the Church of Rome because the C of E isn&#039;t sufficiently misogynist for their taste.)

But I think it&#039;s well worth questioning the associated idea that the spiritual is in some way better than the physical.  This assumption is eloquently questioned in Dory Previn&#039;s song &quot;Mythical Kings and Iguanas&quot;.]]></description>

Moving on to a further remove from the word &quot;bitch&quot;, the elements of earth, water, air and fire are part of the astrologers&#039; conceptual framework.  (Three zodiac signs are assigned to each element.)  In this context, I have seen the feminine elements (water and earth) described as &quot;negative&quot; and the masculine ones (fire and air) as &quot;positive&quot;.  Furthermore, the symbols for water and earth involve a downward pointing triangle, those for air and fire an upwards pointing one.  Perhaps there&#039;s no need for me to draw out the possible implications of this.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh, I wish I could comment anonymously. Interesting fact about the word bitch - if a man calls you it a lot and then you turn it around start calling HIM it, it makes him reallyfuckingangry.

Probably to do with both a) the &#039;prison&#039; meaning of the word and b) being a woman/feminised is one thing men don&#039;t like to be called...]]></description>

Ah yes. I find the whole issue of how gender differences have been presented completely fascinating: one of the implications for what you&#039;re saying (and, indeed, for &#039;bitch&#039; as a word) is that the Victorian idea of the Angel in the House was a complete reversal of everything that had gone before. I suppose it&#039;s quite an obvious point, that, but it&#039;s something that I, at any rate, never really thought to connect with the Medieval idea of women as dangerous sex-obsessed maniacs. The flip side is what happened to men, too - they stopped being fire and air and became penis-driven bundles of testosterone. Why?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Interesting Renaissance medicine detail - much like in the way of the four humours, people were described by clerics in elemental terms - men being more made up of fire and air (passion/strength, clear-mindedness) and women earth and water (earthly, emotional) - men were therefore closer to God (or at least had a headstart) because they were elementally lighter and closer to heaven, whereas women were weighed down by their tendancy to be full of fluid and busy doing dirty work down in the mud with the devil...

Just something I picked up amongst information about witch-hunts...]]></description>
