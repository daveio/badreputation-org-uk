					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2010/10/29/linkspost-the-first/#comment-229&quot;&gt;Stephen B&lt;/a&gt;.

I watched it a bit ago, and it all moves very fast, but one of my biggest questions about it is actually The Caliban Question.  The only non-white person on the cast that I can see on a first viewing is playing Caliban. This makes me wonder where they&#039;re going with Caliban - the colonialism-critique angle&#039;s been done so many times that even if they&#039;re not going there, they surely must expect someone to notice the casting decisions and wonder if they&#039;re going for it. 

They&#039;ve done some stuff with the make-up for Caliban that seems to be making quite an assertively &quot;yes, we are self-aware about these questions&quot; statement, though - his face on the poster is half white, with one blue eye.  Which may well be intended to serve as a useful constant reminder that Caliban as a character is wholly a white creation of the &quot;other&quot; through white eyes (not that I should be getting in this deep from a TRAILER ALONE, but whatevs). And it looks a bit like they&#039;re definitely trying to signal that they&#039;ve been ruminating on these Caliban Casting Questions, which inevitably come up with the Tempest given its themes and performance history.

Julie Taymor also has a respectable track record with sensitive treatments of race issues on stage and screen as far as I&#039;m aware - she took Disney&#039;s Lion King and sent it through a prism of traditional African storytelling and design, with a predominantly black cast and choir, and beautiful use of textiles in the set designs. 

So basically I&#039;m very interested to see how they tackle this play, which is complex beast, even by Shakespeare&#039;s standards. 

I really hope Miranda has some force (it&#039;s personal, haha). You can play her pretty fierce and depth-ful - she lives on an island covered in spirits! she&#039;s a shaman&#039;s daughter! - but so many productions I&#039;ve seen had her princessed up to the nines.

OH MY GOD WHAT A LONG COMMENT. I don&#039;t know how that even happened. ]]></description>
