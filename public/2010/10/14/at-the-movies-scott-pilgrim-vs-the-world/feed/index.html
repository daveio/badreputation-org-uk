It&#039;s interesting to compare with Tamora Drewe (which we saw the same weekend as seeing Scott Pilgrim and The Runaways). Even if it passes the Bechdel test (which I&#039;m not 100% sure it does), I thought Tamora Drewe missed some opportunities in a similar way. Which didn&#039;t make it bad at all (I though it was fantastic and qua film much better than Scott Pilgrim although superdifferent).

I think it&#039;s worth celebrating &quot;Hey, not nearly as horribly messed up as I was fearing!&quot; but also to acknowledge that we&#039;re settling. I read some stuff that makes it sound like the Scott Pilgrim series is a radically feminist work and it really isn&#039;t. It has female characters that I like and wish had gotten more care from the author. But it&#039;s also breezy fun.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I thought a lot of gender issues were really well done in the film, and didn&#039;t mind it being geeky/male-focused: it&#039;s clearly about what&#039;s in Scott&#039;s head, and acknowledges that he&#039;s not mature or very aware. Or even a nice guy.

Wallace was *great*. I agree the straight vs gay masculinity didn&#039;t exist, and also that being gay meant no change whatsoever in the behaviour of those around him.

But on the flip side of that: Scott is the ~least masculine man ever to walk the face of the Earth~ (mostly because that&#039;s what Michael Cera is, in movies). And sleeping in a gay man&#039;s bed is part of it.

Not having his own place is also part of it, but to the general public &quot;gay man&#039;s bed&quot; is even lower on the Loser scale than &quot;Mom&#039;s basement&quot; and I don&#039;t think it&#039;s seen as a neutral statement in the comics or the movie either. The characters don&#039;t mind it (except when they want privacy) but O&#039;Malley must have known that readers would see it as a sign that Scott isn&#039;t in charge of his life.

I think the stigma is sexual though. There&#039;s the inconvenience he faces when it intrudes on his sleep - he can&#039;t afford his own place, so isn&#039;t in control. But it would be seen differently if it was 3 straight guys with no money sharing a tiny apartment while they try to find jobs in the big city, and hey it&#039;s only temporary. This is a gay man&#039;s *bed*.

So I think there&#039;s a bit of both. To see all the characters be utterly relaxed about most of the gay issues is fantastic, but that doesn&#039;t mean Scott&#039;s masculinity wasn&#039;t judged (by the average audience, if not the creators).]]></description>

I agree with you on the &quot;it&#039;s all about Scott learning not to be a dick&quot; not being a catch-all excuse, and to be crude for a moment, I reckon Hollywood could do with learning to be *about* less dicks, at least in an obvious heteronormative sense, more generally! 

The issue for me is that in a world, and a Hollywood, where Bechdel passes &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;female characters that are motivated like male ones tend to be in shorter supply (ie. not exclusively in existence as love interests, for example!), a movie like Scott Pilgrim failing to give more inner life to its women seems to &lt;em&gt;matter more&lt;/em&gt;.  Somehow it feels like it&#039;s not the movie in and of itself that&#039;s the problem so much as the feeling of &quot;is this all we get?&quot; if that makes sense.  I think the movie has some good things going for it genderwise, bar some of the hairier moments outlined earlier about orgasms (it&#039;s either on this thread or on our other SP post thread!). But I think it matters more to us that it be better, perhaps, because of the goals it actually does score for things like gay visibility and so on - the good stuff makes us go &quot;ah, jeez, why couldn&#039;t you go all the way with this?&quot; I, for one, spent hours before the film arguing with the rest of the BadRep team about the fact that this sort of film - Scott-centric, geek-male-centric, is the one that will get a Hollywood green light where Ramona Flowers Vs. The World might not. 

Reading this thread, and without having read the books, I think that had they serialised these films into a set, we&#039;d have got a better deal on the female characters, actually. 

I think that giving the ladies more room to breathe and develop would balance out the &quot;win the girl, like a really patriarchal legend of old!&quot; framing device, and&lt;em&gt; actually bear out the irony.&lt;/em&gt; The irony of this stuff happening in the modern world only really becomes ironic at all, and is borne out much more, if the characters can actually transcend the save-the-girl stuff. And from what I&#039;m reading, that happens far more successfully in the books. 

Sadly - and I do think it&#039;s a shame nonetheless - the film hasn&#039;t done too well at the US box office even in the form it *was* released in.]]></description>

I still don&#039;t see any of the passes which are more than highly technical passes. And even most of those, IIRC, have one character *trying* to talk about something else and being blown off.

Again, failing the Bechdel test doesn&#039;t invalidate the film or make it unenjoyable. It doesn&#039;t even entail that there were no strong, interesting female characters. However, I think failing it is one indicator. The fact that it was all about Scott all the time is another.

(And it *could* have easily passed, as all the technical passes indicate.)

(Note that I&#039;m pretty sure it passes the reverse Bechdel test. So being about Scott all the time isn&#039;t quite sufficient.)

I like what I can project on to the female characters, but I don&#039;t find them particularly well characterized (or at least particularly feministically characterized). YYMV.]]></description>

It&#039;s definitely debatable how well it passes, but I think it&#039;s also the case that romantic comedy films about relationship obsessed gangs of young people, all of whom have a gossipy obsession with the relationship between two of their number.... are going to have trouble with Bechdel whether, as films, they have interesting, well represented female characters or not...

I think it&#039;s actually an example of the limitations of Bechdel as a rubric for judging all films. The film fails in several places, and is good in others, I think. 

I would have liked to see Ramona and Kim&#039;s friendship on-screen, yes. I think the women are all a little island-like. Mind you, we barely see the non-Scott men have much inner life either!]]></description>

Actually it passes in loads of places. http://bechdeltest.com/view/1468/scott_pilgrim_vs._the_world/

Not that passing means &#039;yes - it is feminist&#039; or &#039;no - it is not feminist.&#039; Or even that it&#039;s a good or bad movie.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You&#039;ve actually changed my mind about this film - I kinda found it a bit meh at the time, but Knives is indeed awesome and it has plenty of good bits and you&#039;re right about the ghost of partners past - nobody can help wondering how we match up to our predecessors. It&#039;s a good theme.

However, all the things you pointed out as feminist-relevent hadn&#039;t actually jumped out at me. Maybe it&#039;s cos they&#039;re so standard in my life... no-one I know would mind sharing a bed with someone of a different orientation to them (that I know) of and I grew up in a school where feminist was kind of the default setting of all teachers and students and most people I spent time with were &#039;at least a little bi-curious&#039; - I suppose it&#039;s weird to be reminded that some people would see this as not standard...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Alas, it still fails the Bechdel test (well, it might techically pass it for the scene where..er...Julie Flowers? tries to talk with Envy about her work, roughly; but Envy doesn&#039;t respond!).
