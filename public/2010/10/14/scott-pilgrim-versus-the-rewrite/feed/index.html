					<description><![CDATA[I just assumed that the film was really about how Scott Pilgrim goes mad and kills himself.

First he starts hallucinating this imaginary girlfriend, and then he beats up random people on the premise that they are her evil exes. Eventually he shoots his best chance of success in the foot by beating up the battle of the bands dude due to his paranoid delusions, then finally he is abandoned by his long-suffering high-schooler girlfriend and steps through the door out of the world (probably in front of a truck or something) with his delusion.

But maybe that&#039;s just me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice pair of reviews. Er, so to speak.

Interesting to see how your different approaches to it gel with my own. 

Markgraf highlighted what to me was the big deal of the film, which was that fighting the evil exes was allegorical for fighting the ghosts of the past - the experience, in the real world, of wading through your partner&#039;s emotional baggage, and being compared to memories you can never hope to live up to. 

But Jenni picked up what for me was the second biggest deal of the film, which was how subjective the story is. It&#039;s like those cut-scenes from old John Cusack films where the hero&#039;s emotional state is conveyed in a hyperreal &quot;daydream&quot; retelling of the current scene, before snapping back to the waking world. Except Scott never comes out of his daydream.

Many thanks. Both cool reviews.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2010/10/14/scott-pilgrim-versus-the-rewrite/#comment-133&quot;&gt;Jenni&lt;/a&gt;.

The more I read this thread, the more I wish they&#039;d serialised the films, like the comics! Squishing it all into a film meant that Wallace became the Flagship Gay Male Character, Roxy the Flagship Gay Female Character, bisexuality was an off-screen, alluded-to-as-a-phase event, and so on. 

There&#039;s so much stuff going on that just isn&#039;t in the films! Which leaves the films feeling much more like they rely on the Big Damsel Winning framing device rather than it being only part of what&#039;s going on. 

The more I hear about this franchise, the more I see why so many of my feminist friends like it. Because, as you know, I spent MONTHS going &quot;Have you guys all gone mad? This sounds like Super Mario with an emo haircut! The rotten PREMISE of this UNCONVINCES ME, claims of wry irony notwithstanding! The PREMMMMISE! D:&quot;.

And so on. ]]></description>

Wait. You can play the game so that Kim Pine ends up with Knives, was that?  Or is it that Ramona does?!

Either is a pretty good call, I reckon. I like what I&#039;m hearing about the game&#039;s openness to other outcomes, with lots of bisexual possibilities. ]]></description>

Now THAT is interesting. 

That, to me, hints at the good intentions of the directorial decisions, even if they weren&#039;t obvious to all of us.... 

... as I said to a friend or two when I saw the film, though: I&#039;d love to see a Ramona movie! I&#039;d love to see the whole thing from her perspective, with her inner monologues, and so on. 

It&#039;d be like a kickass, better version of that time Stephenie Meyer (not that I particularly endorse her work in any way!) released a version of Twilight as a downloadable PDF... all rewritten from the stone-cold freaking &lt;em&gt;murderous&lt;/em&gt; POV of Edward! ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In the video game, you can choose to play as Ramona. While the plot itself doesn&#039;t change at all, the perspective changes completely. Instead of it being about Scott beating up Ramona&#039;s evil exes so he can be with her, it&#039;s about Ramona taking on her OWN past so that SHE can be with HIM.

Also, in Kim&#039;s ending she ends up with Knives.]]></description>
