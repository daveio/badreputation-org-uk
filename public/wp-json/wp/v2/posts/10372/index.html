  I was very excited to hear of the <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/books\/2012\/mar\/05\/five-hundred-fairytales-discovered-germany\">five
  hundred &#8216;new&#8217; German fairytales from the 1800s<\/a> which had been
  found in an archive in Regensburg. Team BadRep love this stuff &#8211;
  we&#8217;ve previously had a <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/tag\/fairy-tale-fest\/\">Fairy Tale
  Fest<\/a> series of posts on how awesome folk tales can be through a feminist
  lens.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  New sources are always interesting, because they show just how different some
  of the versions were back then. <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/online\/blogs\/books\/2012\/03\/long-lost-fairy-tales.html#ixzz1pdXtlSFw\">This
  article in the
  <strong
    >New Yorker<\/strong> gives some examples<\/a>:<\/p>\n
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Sch\u00f6nwerth\u2019s Cinderella is a woodcutter&#8217;s daughter who
        uses golden slippers to recover her beloved from beyond the moon and the
        sun. His miller&#8217;s daughter wields an ax and uses it to disenchant
        a prince by chopping off the tail of a gigantic black
        cat.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        Even better, that linked article suggests the collection might go
        farther than just focussing on princesses:<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Just as girls became domestic drudges and suffered under the curse of
          evil mothers and stepmothers, boys, too, served out terms as gardeners
          and servants, sometimes banished into the woods by hostile fathers.
          Like Snow White, they had to plead with a hunter for their lives. And
          they are as good as they are beautiful &#8211; Sch\u00f6nwerth uses
          the German term \u201csch\u00f6n,\u201d or beautiful, for both male
          and female protagonists.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n

          alt=\"Photo of a hand holding in its palm a small figurine. It is an

          \/>We commented previously on how fairy tales were often warnings to
          young women that they should be passive and dutiful. In a society
          where girls had the power to cause chaos if they ever stepped outside
          the extreme social restrictions, families wanted children to see these
          dangers on a mythic level. We still do it &#8211; even in
          <strong
            >Star Wars<\/strong>, those who seek personal power are bad and will
            fall to evil. (It has also been pointed out that Governments, the
            Church and other authorities all promoted this mindset throughout
            history, and that it&#8217;s an incredibly good form of population
            control. The idea that niceness and power are incompatible has been
            socially useful, but remains untrue at least on a small scale.)
            <strong
              >Star Wars<\/strong> champions those rebels who seek agency for
              themselves against a dark Authority, but many of its other
              messages would fit right in with the warnings in folk
              tales.<\/p>\n
              <p>
                While the GOOD = PHYSICALLY BEAUTIFUL trope is still ironclad
                across most tales, it looks as though this latest find of
                stories will show the rules about behaviour and the tales of
                young people needing rescue being applied to men just as much as
                women, which could be VERY badass.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                One hundred of the new stories were published in German in 2010,
                but there&#8217;s no news on when any will be translated into
                English. We&#8217;ll keep an eye on this, and keep the good
                readers of BadRep updated! (If there&#8217;s a version where a
                princess kills a dragon with a sword, radio stations scanning
                the outer galaxy will be confused by how loud my cheering must
                have been to have reached them).<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                And if you think that we&#8217;re hoping for too much, that the
                tales might not be that different from the sanitised Victorian
                versions, read that first quote again. Cinderella &#8211; in so
                many versions a figure so passive that she doesn&#8217;t
                announce herself even when the Prince enters her house, right up
                to when he puts the slipper on her foot &#8211; is here the
                heroine who uses magic items and travels impossibly far, taking
                action to rescue her beloved.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                Imagine if Disney had sold us that version in 1950.<\/p>\n<div
