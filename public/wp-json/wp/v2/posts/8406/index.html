  The wonderful website <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lettersofnote.com\"><strong
    >Letters of Note<\/strong><\/a> is always worth reading (or <a
    href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/LettersOfNote\">following on twitter<\/a>),
    and recently they posted a letter which made me reflect on how far
    we&#8217;ve come in a few decades.<\/p>\n
    <p>
      Astronomer and physicist <a
      href=\"http:\/\/www.lettersofnote.com\/2011\/03\/if-membership-is-restricted-to-men-loss.html\">Carl
      Sagan wrote in 1981 to an organisation called &#8220;The Explorers
      Club&#8221;.<\/a> Some history is needed here: this was a group founded in
      1905 in New York, as a club for those who pursue &#8220;Scientific
      Exploration&#8221; (including both Explorers and Scientists). A letterhead
      he mentions in the note says
      <em
        >To the conquest of the unknown and the advancement of knowledge.<\/em>
        Back around 1900, the idea that women could be part of either of those
        professions or join the club wasn&#8217;t considered. The club then
        remained men-only for decades in the name of tradition.<\/p>\n
        <p>
          Sagan was adding his voice to others in the early 1980s asking that
          women should be allowed to be members. His letter is polite, but one
          middle paragraph is a brilliant list of women who have contributed to
          the pursuit of new knowledge:<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            There are several women astronauts. The earliest footprints &#8212;
            3.6 million years old &#8212; made by a member of the human family
            have been found in a volcanic ash flow in Tanzania by
            <strong
              >Mary Leakey<\/strong>. Trailblazing studies of the behavior of
              primates in the wild have been performed by dozens of young women,
              each spending years with a different primate species.
              <strong
                >Jane Goodall<\/strong>&#8216;s studies of the chimpanzee are
                the best known of the investigations which illuminate human
                origins. The undersea depth record is held by
                <strong
                  >Sylvia Earle<\/strong> [pictured below]. The solar wind was
                  first measured in situ by
                  <strong
                    >Marcia Neugebauer<\/strong>, using the Mariner 2
                    spacecraft. The first active volcanoes beyond the Earth were
                    discovered on the Jovian moon Io by
                    <strong
                      >Linda Morabito<\/strong>, using the Voyager 1 spacecraft.
                      These examples of modern exploration and discovery could
                      be multiplied a hundredfold.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n
                      <p>
                        <a href=\"http:\/\/www.explorers.org\/index.php\">The
                        Explorers Club<\/a> changed their policy later that
                        year, and now do not restrict based on gender.<\/p>\n
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        But that&#8217;s not the part which gives me
                        hope.<\/p>\n

                        Sagan&#8217;s letter, the extraordinary thing today is
                        how reasonable he&#8217;s being. He&#8217;s genuinely
                        trying to convince the Club, using facts and appealing
                        to logic, that they should make this change.
                        There&#8217;s no hint of anger or appeal to fairness. He
                        doesn&#8217;t say women deserve equality, and only
                        calmly points out that if you want a &#8216;social club
                        for the boys&#8217; you shouldn&#8217;t claim to
                        represent all scientists and explorers in 1981. In fact
                        he (as a member) acts as though they could have every
                        right to exclude women because of tradition, but that
                        they&#8217;re mistaken and women should in fact qualify
                        under their own rules. (I&#8217;m not saying Sagan
                        wasn&#8217;t passionate about equality, at all &#8211;
                        his belief in it comes through clearly in many of his
                        books and documentaries, and he&#8217;s an absolute
                        hero. I think he was being deliberately polite.)<\/p>\n
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        However, I expect that someone writing to the Explorers
                        Club today might send a very different message. A
                        message which includes the questions &#8220;What do you
                        think you&#8217;re doing?&#8221; and &#8220;Why are you
                        being so incredibly blinkered?&#8221;. I can well
                        believe that there was prejudice against the quality of
                        women&#8217;s roles in science in 1981: there&#8217;s
                        prejudice
                        <em
                          >now<\/em>. But I think the average expectation of
                          what is normal and fair has genuinely shifted, to the
                          point that Sagan&#8217;s letter reads as quite oddly
                          passive today.<\/p>\n
                          <p>
                            In the week when Google <a
                            href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/technology\/2011\/nov\/07\/marie-curie-birth-google-doodle?newsfeed=true\">celebrated

                            today. I also dearly hope it won&#8217;t seem normal
