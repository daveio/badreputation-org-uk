        The Plot Sickens<\/h3>\n
        <p>
          To focus on misogyny is to obscure
          <strong
            >American Psycho<\/strong>\u2019s scope, to ignore that the book is
            an uncompromising, unapologetic vortex of misanthropy and nihilism.
            Its narrator expresses disgust, contempt, anxiety and fear towards
            women, gay people, art students, Jewish people, the non-WASP, the
            homeless, the poor \u2013 anyone, in fact, who differs even by a
            small degree (a marginally more impressive business card, a better
            restaurant table) from the ideal which Bateman forces himself to
            emulate and sustain. Men in the novel are portrayed as
            unsympathetically as women, and dispatched as dispassionately \u2013
            so why is it the torture and death of women that seems to abide with
            the reader?<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_10944\" style=\"width:

              Like all satire, the book exaggerates and burlesques that which
              already exists. The book\u2019s scenes of torture and murder were,
              apparently, all based on Ellis\u2019 reading of real life cases
              and criminology textbooks, not whimsically called into being by
              him. So
              <strong
                >American Psycho<\/strong> on one level is an uncensored,
                unsanitised expos\u00e9 of what has already been done to women
                without any incitement or instruction from its author. Neither
                does Ellis\u2019 writing give the impression that violence
                against women is in any way attractive. The impression it does
                give, to me at least, is that violence against women is
                horrifying, viscerally disgusting, and the preserve of
                fucked-up, nightmarish individuals who are increasingly
                prevalent during a stage of socio-economic development which
                encourages selfishness and greed over empathy, and whose actions
                are increasingly ignored or disbelieved within the same
                environment. His work is a mirror, not a manifesto or an
                instruction manual. To posit it as something qualitatively worse
                either than crimes actually committed against women throughout
                history, or to the presentation of sexualised violence or <a
                href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Serial_killer#In_media_and_popular_culture\">serial
                killing <\/a>in almost any other area of the entertainment
                world, seems dubious.<\/p>\n
                <p>
                  It\u2019s worth noting too how the deaths of Bateman\u2019s
                  victims are affected by their socio-economic background.
                  Having decided against the murder of his date Patricia \u2013
                  a minor character so boringly materialistic that I\u2019m
                  fully on board with the theory that takes her to be
                  Patrick\u2019s imaginary female persona \u2013 Bateman
                  reflects on whether it\u2019s \u2018her family\u2019s wealth
                  [that] protects her tonight\u2019. In contrast, the vagrants
                  and call girls he kills are already economic casualties,
                  considered disposable even before they become casualties of
                  violence. No character from society&#8217;s lower strata
                  appears to be missed; it is only Paul Owen, Patrick&#8217;s
                  peer and rival, whose disappearance is considered deserving
                  enough to warrant a police investigation. The crude and
                  blatant contrast between Bateman\u2019s lifestyle and that of
                  his victims \u2013 their disparity in wealth, and therefore in
                  power, is explicitly fetishized in more than one encounter
                  \u2013 which calls attention to the issue of why the victims
                  of such killers are so often sex workers, or homeless, or
                  transient, both male and female:<\/p>\n

                        work at least in its earlier phases seems, like Ellis,
                        preoccupied with morbidly examining a pathologised
                        masculinity rather than valorising it \u2013 but the
                        most substantial point I drew from the ensuing debate
                        was that the issue may be less such works themselves and
                        more their involvement in the mainstreaming, acceptance
                        and excusing of problematic attitudes. The gynophobic
                        aspects of these works are made respectable by being
                        cloaked as edgy or transgressive, when they merely
                        dramatise the violence and inequality that already
                        exists. Although I still contend that the violence in
                        Ellis\u2019 writing is not there as intentional
                        titillation, as long as there are those for whom such
                        things are lived experience, rather than escapist
                        fantasy or performance material, then there will be a
                        correspondingly visceral response to their artistic
                        portrayal.<\/p>\n
