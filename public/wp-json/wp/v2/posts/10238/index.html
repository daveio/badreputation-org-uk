  Three short months after the release of Ezio\u2019s last dance,
  <strong
    >Assassin\u2019s Creed: Revelations<\/strong>, and we&#8217;ve been graced
    by the presence of the first
    <strong
      >Assassin\u2019s Creed III<\/strong> reveal.\u00a0 So Stephen B, Markgraf,
      Miranda and I had a chatette.<\/p>\n
      <p>
        First off: <a title=\"Assassin's Creed 3 reveal\"
        href=\"http:\/\/youtu.be\/amAVgQ8ef3g\" target=\"_blank\">go check out
        the trailer if you haven\u2019t seen it already.<\/a><\/p>\n

        <strong
          >Stephen B:<\/strong> Well, I&#8217;m a Brit, and that probably
          colours my reaction to the setting. I&#8217;m just not invested in how
          glorious the War of Independence was, and killing the dastardly
          English isn&#8217;t really as exciting to me as Assassins vs.
          Templars.<\/p>\n
          <p>
            My first reaction was concern for the fighting: is going up against
            guns with a small hand-axe really going to work? \u00a0The moves
            lacked the skill and finesse of previous styles, although
            they&#8217;re better on a repeat viewing.\u00a0 Plus, I am a bit
            disappointed that no-one else is <a
            href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/2012\/01\/09\/found-feminism-mass-effect-3-pre-order-box\/\">following
            <strong
              >Mass Effect 3<\/strong>&#8216;s lead<\/a> and doing female
              version trailers. Or&#8230; having
              <em
                >even one female<\/em> in the whole trailer.<\/p>\n
                <p>
                  All this grand posturing is about English vs. American white
                  guys only and the protagonist is of Native American descent,
                  so while you&#8217;re blowing all those trumpets you&#8217;re
                  ignoring the incredible ongoing &amp; future genocide. The
                  game
                  <em
                    >might<\/em> highlight how his people are treated as part of
                    the story, but that&#8217;s not clear from the
                    trailer.<\/p>\n

                        leading lady in this franchise? I&#8217;d love that

                          being different genders through time &#8211; but
                          isn&#8217;t <a

                          well; they&#8217;d have to create a female equivalent?
                          Even without that leap, I&#8217;m personally hoping
                          there are less Sex Assassin type ladies this time
                          around, and more, y&#8217;know, female

                              talked about the Sex Assassin NPC thing<\/a>
                              &#8211; Ubisoft Workshop staff actually read the
                              post, which featured Markgraf&#8217;s own designs
                              for female assassins, and gave it a friendly
                              shoutout, which was nice to see (sadly, when I try
                              to find <a

                              doesn&#8217;t seem to have the hyperlinks anymore.
                              Shame, that &#8211; we were originally hyperlinked
                              from &#8220;we thought this would quell some
                              people&#8217;s fears on where we stand on
                              important subjects&#8221;). We then had a bit of
                              feedback from people who pointed out that there
                              are female assassins in

                                post to address that a bit<\/a>, because the
                                point is, we&#8217;re aware of that, but
                                it&#8217;s not like there isn&#8217;t room for a
                                good deal of progress. <\/p>\n

                                    they\u2019ll fit this protagonist into the
                                    grand scheme of things: after all
                                    historically it&#8217;s one set of
                                    oppressive zealots complaining about being
                                    oppressed (by the English) without a shadow
                                    of irony as they murder and destroy the
                                    indigenous population.\u00a0 Given the
                                    protagonist&#8217;s ethnicity, one has to
                                    wonder how he&#8217;s on either side of this
                                    war, given the racist sentiments aimed at
                                    Native Americans (in that era and
                                    beyond).<\/p>\n
                                    <p>
                                      On the anti-Brit theme, I have my doubts
                                      that it&#8217;ll be handled appropriately
                                      or even accurately &#8211; there are
                                      tendencies when anything American is
                                      involved for Brits to be portrayed as some
                                      sort of devil spawn (which is getting
                                      pretty dull).<\/p>\n

                                            he&#8217;d need to beat the

                                            female pronouns to talk about this
                                            other assassin &#8211; so, where is

                                              see the guy free-running among the

                                              interesting switch from the
