      \/><\/a>With a history spanning three centuries, <a
      href=\"http:\/\/www.tatler.com\/\"><strong
        >Tatler<\/strong><\/a> is Establishment to its very core. It sells
        itself to advertisers as having \u2018the wealthiest readership in the
        UK\u2019 and accordingly peddles luxury goods and the accompanying
        lifestyle to Society dahlings and their postulant doppelgangers. The
        magazine worships the higher reaches of British class structures,
        fawning over those who through their money, their fame or their postcode
        can be considered \u2018society\u2019 and celebrating an incongruous,
        archaic social order.<\/p>\n
        <p>
          <strong
            >Tatler<\/strong> seems an unlikely champion of diversity. The world
            it represents is one of deep privilege in which abide the casts of
            Jilly Cooper novels: men of title or profession and their
            charity-supporting wives; women in Jaeger gilets and and
            twentysomethings who order \u00a319 martinis; the worst upper class
            caricatures made flesh for their own amusement and forwarded as role
            models for the aspirant gaggles. But editor Kate Reardon has noticed
            a problem: gay men, she says, are widely represented in Society but
            gay women are not, and she\u2019s going to do something about
            it.<\/p>\n
            <p>
              Her reasoning is thus: lady-lovers make people \u2018either
              titillated or a little bit frightened\u2019 &#8211; a conclusion I
              can only assume was arrived at with a sense of deep profundity at
              3am and through the bottom of a cocktail glass &#8211; and
              claiming that parents are thrilled when their sons come out but
              embarrassed when their daughters do. Lesbians, she says, have
              never been accepted by High Society, a fact that Virginia Woolf,
              Natalie Clifford Barney and Betty Carstairs apparently missed the
              memo on. The way to address this problem, obviously, is to find
              some sapphic sisters and do a feature on them. Choose wisely,
              though. None too butch, none too&#8230; y\u2019know&#8230; dykey,
              and if they\u2019re over a size 12 then headshots only.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              The fact is that she may well be right, but the issue is not one
              of sexuality but of gender &#8211; lesbians don\u2019t have the
              status and visibility of gay men because women don\u2019t have the
              status and visibility of men. A magazine which targets an
              overwhelmingly female audience (around 80%) is a routine place to
              celebrate women, and putting a handful of queer ladies in the
              spotlight is never going to be a bad thing.<\/p>\n

                about it. Noble enough, I suppose. The problem is that
                <strong
                  >Tatler<\/strong> isn\u2019t exactly bashful when it comes to
                  creating a sensation when sales are falling (Anthea Turner
                  naked but for a python, anyone?) and according to Janet

                    >Daily Mail<\/strong> that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s
                    happening right now. With a drop in readership of more than
                    20% in the last year, and 25% within its target demographic,
                    it\u2019s easy to believe that
                    <strong
                      >Tatler<\/strong> is just trying to pretty up the sales
                      figures. And why not?
                      <strong
                        >Vanity Fair<\/strong> saw a boost in audience with its
                        infamous KD Lang\/Cindy Crawford cover in 1994 just as

                          height of lesbian chic, but the same trick might well
                          work today. However easy it is to think that

                                  we expect? Seven fashion-plate photographs and
                                  an ad for a Belgravia-based lesbian and gay

                                  though seven is not the definitive portfolio
                                  of anything, unless it\u2019s colours of the
                                  rainbow &#8211; and takes up fewer pages than
                                  cover star Alice Eve. Whoever sent out the

                                  issue\u2019 was clearly overstating things a
                                  bit. Each photo is accompanied by a brief,
                                  soundbitey blurb in which such insights as
                                  favorite colour are revealed. It\u2019s an
                                  exercise in mediocrity. I mean, they\u2019ve
                                  managed to make Sue Perkins dull. How is that
                                  even possible?<\/p>\n
