  <p>Markgraf and I are running late.<\/p>\n</p>
  <p>
    My iPhone&#8217;s GPS has lied to us, and now we&#8217;re puffing our way
    along Brighton seafront in characteristically frenetic fashion, looking for
    a rather
    <em
      >un<\/em>characteristic venue: a Methodist church.\u00a0
      &#8220;We&#8217;ve never been to
      <em
        >church<\/em> together!&#8221; I pant.\u00a0 <\/p>\n
        <p>
          &#8220;I know, right? It&#8217;s an adventure,&#8221; says Markgraf.
          &#8220;If we actually find it on time. Or I might just implode into
          the sea,&#8221; he adds, staring again at the fruitless map,
          &#8220;instead.&#8221;<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>&#8220;Mmm. Maybe it&#8217;s this next left?&#8221;<\/p>\n</p>
        <p>*<\/p>\n</p>
        <p>We were there, in a roundabout way, because of Twitter.<\/p>\n</p>
        <p>
          A month previously, I&#8217;d logged in and seen something Markgraf
          had RT\u2019d. The original tweet went something like &#8216;<em
            >Will be observing <a
            href=\"http:\/\/www.transgenderdor.org\">Transgender Day of
            Remembrance<\/a><\/em>&#8216;, adding that &#8216;<em
              >many feminist friends just seem to be ignoring
              it.<\/em>&#8216;<\/p>\n
              <p>
                I made the decision then not to be one of those feminists, and
                shunted myself Googlewards to find out more. I read the <a
                href=\"http:\/\/www.transgenderdor.org\/?page_id=1194\">roll of
                names<\/a><sup

                  \">1<\/a><\/sup>. An angry, sad light went on in my head that
                  day. I texted Markgraf half an hour later.<\/p>\n

                      Reading the stories. It\u2019s heartbreaking. If anything
                      like that ever happened to you I don&#8217;t know what
                      I&#8217;d f***ing do. So, um. There\u2019s an event in
                      Brighton. I think I\u2019m going to go.<br \ />\n<\/em><br
                        \
                      />\nThe response-beep came five minutes later.<br
                        \
                      />\n<em
                        ><br \ />\nYes. Let\u2019s go. Let\u2019s both of us go.
                        And write an article on it.<br \ />\n<\/em><br \ />\nSo
                        that was the plan.<\/p>\n
                        <p>
                          A London event was added later, but we stuck with
                          Brighton. There is <a

                          a hella good tea shop<\/a> there, after all. So
                          Markgraf and I got on a train and went on a kind of
                          pilgrimage.<\/p>\n

                          and read Markgraf&#8217;s post instead<\/a>). This

                          cis people like myself, consider observing TDOR, or at

                              like to think I might, but I suspect I
                              wasn&#8217;t paying nearly enough attention before
                              a personal friend was affected.<\/p>\n

                                Many of the cisgender people I saw at TDOR had
                                some connection to a trans* person themselves
                                \u2013 they were a friend or relative. I
                                don&#8217;t want to over-generalise, but at the
                                same time this seems to be the spur that makes a
                                cis person bother to go to an event like TDOR
                                \u2013 they&#8217;ve watched their loved one
                                experience prejudice and discrimination. Perhaps
                                they\u2019ve yelled at the hooligan hassling
                                their partner. Perhaps they\u2019ve read their
                                friend\u2019s blog and realised that things they
                                take for granted \u2013 using a public loo, say
                                \u2013 can be cause for fear of abuse. These are
                                all good reasons to care. But everyone should
                                care, whether they\u2019ve met someone with a
                                direct experience or not. Hard to achieve when
                                people have to work so hard to find any
                                mainstream media about real trans* experiences
                                at all. There are barely any characters on TV,
                                no bestsellers. The ones we do see are often
                                negatively stereotyped.<\/p>\n

                                In my experience transphobia is never mentioned
                                as an issue or a problem in most educational
                                settings. In any education young people may get

                                    as it happens \u2013 so&#8217;s the vigil.
                                    We slink breathlessly into the church, where

                                    are lone figures, twosomes like us, groups,
                                    couples and families. All in all, about 30
                                    or 40 of us.<\/p>\n

                                      an umbrella, decorating their home. I
                                      think of these people I&#8217;ve never
                                      met, with their own lives and loves,
                                      quirks and habits, all of them brutally,
                                      senselessly murdered, and I can\u2019t
                                      hold back tears for the names on this
                                      long, long list.<\/p>\n
                                      <p>
                                        There&#8217;s a current of horrified
                                        energy coursing silently through the
                                        room with the names, with these murders.
                                        Beheadings, burnings, shootings;
                                        it&#8217;s relentless. Some attendees
                                        are old hands. Some are realising in
                                        front of me how heavily the dice are
                                        stacked against them. I am watching
                                        people, many of them very young, realise
                                        that a great many people in the world at
                                        large would shrug if they were murdered.
                                        Afterwards, as people clutch plastic
                                        cups of tea and began to talk again, one
                                        attendee murmurs to me, &#8220;You know,
                                        I go to Pride, I go on protests. I go
                                        out for causes. And I really feel that
                                        other people &#8211; they need to be
                                        here. It&#8217;s time for them to come
                                        out for us.&#8221; Later, she passes an
                                        email address on to Markgraf, who has
                                        mentioned that the town where he lives
                                        has nothing like the Clare Project, with
                                        a promise of support.<\/p>\n

                                        I&#8217;m never quite sure what to do
                                        with myself in churches. But
                                        there\u2019s a paper tree in the little
                                        anteroom near the church doors, with
                                        detachable paper leaves. There\u2019s a
                                        pencil on the little altar and an
                                        invitation to write your own prayers, or
                                        thoughts. I just write:<\/p>\n
