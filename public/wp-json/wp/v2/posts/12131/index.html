  While I wholeheartedly approve of <a title=\"Bad Reputation - In Defence of
  Fanfiction\"
  href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/2012\/07\/09\/guest-post-in-defence-of-fanfiction\/\">fanfiction<\/a>,
  I&#8217;ve never been a big fanfic reader. Not because of any quibbles over
  canon or squeamishness about interpretation, but because I&#8217;m too
  stubborn to spend any time in anyone else&#8217;s version of something I love.
  The versions I craft myself tend to stay in my head, but they entirely prevent
  me from enjoying myself with fanfic.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  However, in the pursuit of pop culture adventures I&#8217;ve recently found
  myself spending some time with Mary Russell, the heroine of a series of books
  by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.laurierking.com\/\">Laurie R King<\/a> which also
  feature Sherlock Holmes as her mentor, and later her husband. Like Holmes,
  Russell (her preferred moniker) is intelligent, logical, brave, unconventional
  and excellent at fighting, with a superb aim and a talent for disguises etc
  etc. She is Jewish, British-American, and studies theology at Oxford. She also
  dresses in men&#8217;s clothes.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  What drew me to the books was the fact that Russell is a self-described
  feminist. Although she mentions her political beliefs in the first book,
  1994&#8217;s <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.laurierking.com\/books\/mary-russell\/the-beekeepers-apprentice-1994\"><strong
    >The Beekeeper&#8217;s Apprentice<\/strong><\/a>, the second is all about
    feminism. Well, feminism and theology. And murder. It&#8217;s even called <a
    href=\"http:\/\/www.laurierking.com\/books\/mary-russell\/a-monstrous-regiment-of-women-1995\"><strong
      >A Monstrous Regiment of Women<\/strong><\/a>. I enjoyed it immensely,
      despite many silly moments and patchy writing. Incidentally the majority
      of the writing is pretty good, and I feel that the voice of Holmes rings
      true most of the time, which is no mean feat.<\/p>\n
      <p>The author says of the series:<\/p>\n</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Mary Russell is what Sherlock Holmes would look like if Holmes, the
          Victorian detective, were a) a woman, b) of the Twentieth century, and
          c) interested in theology. If the mind is like an engine, free of
          gender and nurture considerations, then the Russell and Holmes stories
          are about two people whose basic mental mechanism is identical. What
          they do with it, however, is where the interest
          lies.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          I find this intriguing, and I&#8217;m tempted to read the books again
          with that genderless mental mechanism in mind. For Holmes, the mind as
          an engine is his proclaimed ideal; flawless logic and cool
          rationality. Watson (in Conan Doyle&#8217;s <a
          href=\"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/files\/1661\/1661-h\/1661-h.htm#1\"><strong
            >A Scandal In Bohemia<\/strong><\/a>) famously describes
            Holmes&#8217; low opinion (and fear?) of those &#8220;softer
            passions&#8221; which &#8220;might throw a doubt upon all his mental
            results. Grit in a sensitive instrument would not be more disturbing
            than a strong emotion in a nature such as his.&#8221;<\/p>\n
            <p>
              Of course, it&#8217;s Holmes&#8217;s human deviation from this
              mechanical ideal that is often most interesting to readers and
              fans. (See also: Mr Spock.) Russell is more well-adjusted; that is
              to say she acknowledges her emotions, and her desire, although
              grudgingly. Whether this is because she is a woman, because she is
              a citizen of the 20thC or because we as readers have more access
              to her thoughts than we do Holmes&#8217;s I couldn&#8217;t
              say.<\/p>\n

              She&#8217;s also very androgynous, something I enjoyed reading in
              a historical setting. But her masculine traits made me wonder if a
              feminine female Holmes is an impossibility. Would the character be
              in a permament spasm of contradiction or would they make a better
              go of reconciling femininity and reason than Holmes seems to be
              able to? Perhaps Conan Doyle came closer than most himself with <a
              title=\"ASH Irene Adler\"
              href=\"http:\/\/www.ash-nyc.com\/irene.htm\"
              target=\"_blank\">Irene Adler<\/a>, often positioned as
              Holmes&#8217; female counterpart. While she is formidably
              intelligent, she is also impulsive, emotional, and sexual.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              The thing I found most difficult to deal with, like many readers I
              suspect, is their May to December romance. When they meet, he is
              52. And she is 15. When they marry they are 58 and 21
              respectively. And for added creepiness, after their first (awful,
              awful) kiss:
              <em
                >\u201cBy God,\u201d he murmured throatily into my hair.
                \u201cI&#8217;ve wanted to do that since the moment I laid eyes
                upon you.\u201d<\/em> What is there to say except *vom*?<\/p>\n
                <p>
                  Thankfully, the first hint of anything sexual between them
                  arrives right at the end of the second book in the series when
                  Russell is 21. Holmes just spends most of the first novel in
                  which she is a teenager stroking her hair in a fatherly
                  fashion. Still, there are some unsettlingly groom-y undertones
                  which means the novels rely very heavily on the reader&#8217;s
                  trust in Holmes as the embodiment of honour.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  The other bothersome thing for me is Russell&#8217;s
                  unavoidable <a

                  Sue<\/a>-ness. As well as acting as an avatar for the author
                  (also a Jewish, British-American, feminist theologian) she
                  ticks lots of <a
                  href=\"http:\/\/tvtropes.org\/pmwiki\/pmwiki.php\/Main\/CommonMarySueTraits\">the
                  boxes<\/a>: succeeds at everything, is effortlessly friends
                  with everyone, has a dramatic and tragic backstory, no flaws
                  that aren&#8217;t endearing, and so on.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  Arguably though, as far as being a freakish overachiever goes
                  she is no more of a Mary Sue than Holmes himself. I think
                  there&#8217;s a lot of truth in the argument that Mary Sue and
                  her counterpart <a

                  Stu<\/a> face double standards, and that successful, powerful
                  female characters are dismissed or undermined through
                  accusations of being a Mary Sue. Rhiannon at <a

                  <p>
                    &#8230;once the words \u201cMary Sue\u201d have been
                    uttered, all productive conversation is shut down. It says
                    that the character is not worth talking about, not worth
                    analyzing, because she\u2019s somehow incomplete&#8230;
                    She\u2019s not a character but a projection of female
                    fantasy, and therefore innately, indisputably bad. Any
                    character who falls into this category might be somewhat
                    one-dimensional, lacking the depth and flaws needed for a
                    really compelling character, but the term goes beyond that,
                    throwing on implications of worthlessness (at best) and a
                    kind of superior disgust at girlish dreams and ambitions (at
                    worst). Because \u201cMary Sue\u201d only refers to female

                    Although I picked up the first book because of the fandom, I
                    found myself wishing the Mary Russell books had simply been
                    a series of novels about a feminist woman detective in the
                    early 20thC. I think Russell would make a fine addition to
                    the ranks occupied by <a
                    href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Miss_Marple\">Miss

                    href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mrs_Bradley\">Mrs
                    Bradley<\/a>, being a little less genteel and younger, more
                    impulsive, and more of an action detective in the manner of
                    Holmes, employing disguises and fisticuffs as necessary.
                    They&#8217;re good stories, and although Holmes is in the
                    background I&#8217;m not sure he needs to be there at
                    all.<\/p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div

                                          spending some time with Mary Russell,
                                          the heroine of a series of books by
                                          Laurie R King which also feature
                                          Sherlock Holmes as her mentor, and
                                          later her husband.<\/p>\n<div
