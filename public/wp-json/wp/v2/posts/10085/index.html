    >Here&#8217;s a guest post reader Michael Pereira sent us which then
    generated a mini-discussion, so there&#8217;s also a little bit of BadRep
    Towers Q&amp;A tacked on the end. <\/em><\/p>\n
    <p>
      I\u2019m a massive fan of
      <strong
        >Star Wars &#8211; <\/strong> from back when I was growing up watching
        old VHS tapes containing 1980s commercials (and that fizzy line that
        would go down the screen indicative of tape data decay), to the
        voluminous novels and graphic novels I read as an awkward teenager,
        through to the infamous new trilogy with all its flaws &#8211; and there
        definitely are many flaws. Even if we excuse the bad dialogue of
        2005\u2019s
        <strong
          >Revenge of the Sith<\/strong>, the ongoing debate about the
          canonicity of the
          <strong
            >Star Wars<\/strong> timeline, or even Jar Jar Binks, there are
            distinct flaws present in the first trilogy which make the films
            fare pretty badly in the politics of difference.<\/p>\n
            <p>
              For a fantasy science fiction world with all kinds of alien
              species, the first
              <strong
                >Star Wars<\/strong> trilogy didn\u2019t fare well in terms of
                embracing real-life social diversity. There were very few
                non-white or female characters, and when they were present as
                main characters, they weren&#8217;t exactly charitable
                representations. Leia is defined first by the fact she is female
                (gold bikini, anyone?), and (perhaps because there are so few
                women in the galaxy?) even her own brother is initially
                attracted to her. Although Leia had many heroic tendencies, the
                original trilogy would surely fail the Bechdel test since there
                are so few women visibly present in speaking roles. Don\u2019t
                get me started on the lack of (human) ethnic diversity &#8211;
                put it this way, when the species of <a
                href=\"http:\/\/starwars.wikia.com\/wiki\/Mon_Calamari\">Mon
                Cala mari<\/a> are better represented than human diversity, you
                know something\u2019s wrong.<\/p>\n
                <p>
                  This aside, I&#8217;ve quite enjoyed a recent offering from
                  the
                  <strong
                    >Star Wars<\/strong> cash empire: the animated series
                    <strong
                      >Star Wars: The Clone Wars<\/strong> (or
                      <strong
                        >TCW<\/strong>). The premise of the series is that
                        it&#8217;s supposed to take place in the couple of years
                        between Episodes II and III. The later novels and films
                        have integrated a little bit more diversity into the
                        series, even trying to retcon why there are so few women
                        around in the Empire (it&#8217;s due to the
                        Emperor\u2019s sexist ideology).<\/p>\n
                        <p>
                          <strong
                            >TCW<\/strong> is set in the period where destined
                            future villain Anakin Skywalker is now an
                            established Jedi Knight and takes on an apprentice
                            of his own. The moment of Found Feminism for me
                            arrives with the five-foot-something appearance of
                            his apprentice: the awesome
                            <strong
                              >Ahsoka Tano<\/strong>. Ahsoka (nicknamed
                              \u2018Snips\u2019) is an unruly teenage Jedi whose
                              aggression and flagrant disrespect for authority
                              is markedly similar to Anakin\u2019s.<\/p>\n

                                After some reflection, I found myself liking
                                Ahsoka more and more. She&#8217;s a
                                swashbuckling Jedi risking her life on a regular
                                basis with bravery and self-sacrifice, but
                                sometimes she also shows a capacity for
                                self-criticism and learning, and at no point do
                                the other Jedi pass demeaning comment on her on
                                the basis of her gender, nor is she defined as a
                                character by any sense of sexuality. Most of the
                                criticism she does receive comes as a result of
                                her young age and brash manner. It&#8217;s
                                refreshing to see a character like her
                                represented in a less gendered way, and that the
                                ways in which she is both awesome and flawed
                                don&#8217;t come down to essentialist concepts
                                of femininity or female sexuality. She
                                isn&#8217;t depicted in a putative gendered
                                manner &#8211; even when other Jedi such as
                                Anakin or Mace Windu are exemplars of a
                                archetypical masculinities, from &#8216;hunky
                                hearthrob&#8217; to &#8216;badass motherf*cka
                                token black guy&#8217;, Ahsoka\u2019s merits as
                                a character come from her inner resolve,
                                personal strength and her commitment to the Jedi
                                Order and the Galactic Republic, and not her
                                looks, what she wears or who she fancies.<\/p>\n

                                    does not exclude women from roles of

                                          about Star Wars continuity for a
                                          moment, Ahsoka obviously isn&#8217;t
                                          in the movies. Although LucasFilm
                                          isn&#8217;t exactly famous for
                                          continuity, what do you think will
                                          happen to her at the end of the
                                          series? <\/em><\/p>\n
                                          <p>
                                            I think she&#8217;s going to die,
                                            but the question of her fate will
                                            probably be answered in the final
                                            (perhaps 5th?) season. The show
                                            builds up a positive and somewhat
                                            simplistic view of the Republic,
                                            partly because it&#8217;s a
                                            kid&#8217;s show, but there&#8217;s
                                            a sense of pathos for the older
                                            audience who know all the
                                            relationships between the clones and
                                            Jedi will break down &#8211; and
                                            that Palpatine is really the bad
                                            guy. Ahsoka&#8217;s death is
                                            prophesised between the episodes
                                            3&#215;09-13, but these episodes
                                            were very weird and hard to

                                                  image search to remind myself
                                                  of her different outfits, and
                                                  I found some fanart,
                                                  &#8216;sexy&#8217; cosplay
                                                  outfits, and a few actual
                                                  pictures from the series. In a
                                                  way, I think that reinforces
                                                  the answer I was originally
                                                  going to give to you. My view
                                                  is this: the show is expressed
                                                  through a male gaze in the
                                                  sense that in a series about
                                                  war, technology, weaponry and
                                                  realpolitik, almost all of the
                                                  people in positions of
                                                  authority (clone commanders,
                                                  Jedi generals, Palpatine,
                                                  Dooku, Yoda etc) are men. To
                                                  be honest, I don&#8217;t know
                                                  how to interpret
                                                  Ahsoka&#8217;s bare midriff.
                                                  In one sense you might say
                                                  that because it&#8217;s
                                                  science fiction, all kinds of
                                                  kooky outfits can exist to
                                                  highlight non-human styles and
                                                  costumes. You might also say
                                                  that female Jedi tend to dress
                                                  a little bit differently to
                                                  male Jedi. On the other hand,
                                                  when I did that Google search,
                                                  under &#8216;related

                                                    I&#8217;ve also found some
                                                    fairly sexualised fan
                                                    pictures. So I think
                                                    it&#8217;s fair to say that
                                                    among a large number of
                                                    (probably) male fans, her
                                                    outfit has been interpreted
                                                    as &#8216;sexually

                                                      I think this is the kind
                                                      of issue that people will
                                                      have to interpret in their
                                                      own way &#8211; just
                                                      because she dresses in a
                                                      certain way that some men
                                                      definitely think is
                                                      sexual, doesn&#8217;t mean
                                                      there isn&#8217;t scope
                                                      for alternative
                                                      interpretations. However,
                                                      I&#8217;m no sociologist,
                                                      and I&#8217;m not a woman.
                                                      I lean on the side that
                                                      it&#8217;s a bit

                                                      since Padawans would
