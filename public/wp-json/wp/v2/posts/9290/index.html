  Ladies and gents, I have a confession: I watch the crappiest, most
  sensationalist reality shows and \u2018documentaries\u2019 \u2013 as long as I
  think no one\u2019s looking. However, my latest one is so bad and so
  compulsive that I\u2019ve forced at least three friends to watch episodes with
  me. It\u2019s car crash TV, it\u2019s Two Minutes Hate strung out for 45: it
  is Channel 4\u2019s <a

      <strong
        >Sorority Girls<\/strong> is a reality TV show based around five girls
        from American sororities doing the standard reality TV show whittle to
        find their perfect \u2018sisters\u2019 in the UK and form
        Britain&#8217;s first ever sorority. That\u2019s right: it\u2019s

          >The Apprentice<\/strong> for female friendship. Didn\u2019t realise
          you had to jump through hoops, sing songs and outperform others to be
          friends? Think again.<\/p>\n
          <h3>
            What Are Friends For<\/h3>\n
            <p>
              In the <a
              href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fraternities_and_sororities\">\u2018Greek
              system\u2019<\/a> of sororities (sisterhoods) and fraternities
              (brotherhoods), people in colleges in the US can apply to join a
              sorority or a fraternity (each is represented by various Greek
              letters) \u2013 a combination of accommodation and social
              activities which &#8211; they keep telling us &#8211; is where you
              make friends for life.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              However, obviously not everyone wants to be friends with everyone
              &#8211; so there&#8217;s a selection process. In
              <strong
                >Sorority Girls<\/strong> it begins with an interview in which
                each potential new member (or \u2018PNM\u2019 \u2013 this thing
                <a
                href=\"http:\/\/www.e4.com\/sororitygirls\/articles\/glossary.html\">has
                more jargon than a pick-up artist convention<\/a>) is
                interviewed about themselves by the five, identically-dressed,
                rictus-smile-wearing members. Questions include \u201cCan you
                talk me through your outfit?\u201d, \u201cCan you show us your
                best dance move?\u201d and \u201cDo you think we\u2019re heading
                for a double dip recession?\u201d Seriously, WTF? EXPLAIN WHY
                YOU WORE THOSE CLOTHES! DANCE FOR US, MONKEY! NO, HONEST
                WE\u2019RE INTELLECTUAL!<\/p>\n
                <p>
                  If you get through this hoop, you&#8217;re allowed (gee,
                  thanks) to pledge your loyalty to the sorority, and you become
                  a \u2018pledge\u2019 &#8211; not to be confused with a
                  fully-initiated sorority sister. YOU HAVE AGES YET TO GO.
                  REPEAT: AGES.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  At this stage, you get the <a
                  href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hazing\">hazing<\/a>.
                  Interestingly, Channel 4 avoided the h-word for the whole
                  series. Fraternities especially are infamous for their
                  often-dangerous hazing \u2013 usually mixes of brutality,
                  alcohol and stupidity \u2013 and stories of student deaths are
                  sadly <a
                  href=\"http:\/\/www.hanknuwer.com\/hazingdeaths.html\">all too
                  frequent<\/a>. However, though sororities are <a

                  completely free of violence<\/a>, in the main their selection
                  processes are known for being far more about judgement,
                  humiliation, and policing each others\u2019 behaviour. All for
                  the grand prize of&#8230; being friends.<\/p>\n

                    stupidity have probably always been facts of life at
                    universities (as elsewhere), the focus on controlling each
                    others&#8217; behaviour wasn&#8217;t always what sororities
                    were about. My grandmother was the chair of her sorority
                    (Delta Phi Epsilon, known as \u2018Dogs, Pigs and
                    Elephants\u2019 to those that didn\u2019t like them) when
                    she was at NYU in the 1940s, but in the 1940s, after some
                    pretty mild\/vaguely titillating humiliation for a week (be

                    beret &#8211; the next) you were in the club. And then you
                    had a home-from-home at a time when most women at university
                    were still living with their parents. It was more&#8230;
                    necessary, if that\u2019s the word. Its role was mostly in
                    facilitating female students having some freedom in a safe
                    space (once people were in the club they went out drinking
                    and dancing frequently).<\/p>\n

                  <p>
                    By the 1970s (when my mother was at university in the
                    States) sorority and fraternity membership was waning and
                    seen by many as old fashioned and uncool, but from the
                    mid-1980s onwards a revival has been going on, in much the
                    same time period as the rise of the Christian right wing.

                      disguise of helping the pledges \u2018develop\u2019 and

                                                Fraternities are famed for their
                                                heavy-drinking, womanising, loud

                                                bitchiness and ladylike reserve,
                                                but at the same time &#8211;

                                                However, the one girl who

                                                In another stupid task the girls
                                                were taken to a town centre and
                                                told they had 20 minutes to find
                                                a \u2018date\u2019 for an event
                                                that evening. Regardless of
                                                attraction, they needed a man

                                                find one &#8211; fast. Some of
                                                them already had boyfriends, and
                                                some of them had to \u2018make
                                                do\u2019 or bargain that

                                                drinks. This was not about any
