    >A few snapshots of different sorts of feminists, their families and the
    festive season. I\u2019m fortunate to have lots of lovely people in my

              My name is Lily and I&#8217;m a literature student, photographer
              and occasional event organiser of Crimson (a BDSM club) and Peer
              Rope London among other things. I&#8217;m 23 and have been with my
              boyfriend for almost five years and with my girlfriend for almost
              four (I&#8217;m polyamorous). I&#8217;malso pagan, as are my
              parents; something I don&#8217;t advertise overmuch, but which may
              impact on the rest of this interview. I was born and grew up in
              London and am very close to my family, who live ten minutes away
              from us in Wimbledon.<\/p>\n

                <p>
                  For the last few years, we (my boyfriend and I) have had small
                  Christmas celebrations by ourselves, except for a traditional
                  walk on the common with my family in the morning, then friends
                  have come over in the evening. We usually see our girlfriend
                  the week beforehand for mini-christmasness; she spends the
                  actual holiday with her primary partner. This year, however,
                  we are hosting christmas for the first time for my family
                  (mummy, dad and little brother). I&#8217;m cooking, not
                  because I
                  <em
                    >have<\/em> to, but because I love cooking for people and I
                    get annoyed with other people in the kitchen really quickly!
                    So, we will open stockings, go on our morning walk, open
                    presents, chill out, have christmas dinner. Then more
                    chilling out, a game of cluedo or something and then movies
                    (Wallace and Gromit!), port and bedtime.\u00a0\u00a0My
                    family isn&#8217;t christian, so it&#8217;s never been about
                    religion for us (we celebrate Yule instead); it&#8217;s a
                    chance to celebrate the people you love, have a good time
                    and take time out to spend with each other.<\/p>\n

                              independent shops, but otherwise I pick up curious
                              little things when I see them in the shops. I like
                              shopping for other people.<\/p>\n

                                  I feel a need to not be gender biased in my
                                  present giving. I tend to use <a

                                  Bazaar<\/a> to get a lot of things (like the
                                  lanterns, sparkling skulls, etc), because they
                                  stock a range of stuff that isn&#8217;t gender
                                  specific. They&#8217;re also great for kids as
                                  well as adults. I despise most kids shops at
                                  this time of year, when everything is split
                                  into pink and blue; Early Learning Centre is a

                                  I actually was horrified by a couple of things
                                  in Hamleys, especially its
                                  <em
                                    >beauty bar<\/em> for girls, which offers
                                    pre-teens manicures etc, and is called <a
                                    href=\"http:\/\/www.yourtantrum.com\/hamleys\/\"><em
                                      >Tantrum<\/em><\/a>. And the fact that in
                                      order to market something to girls, you
                                      should just take the normal toy and paint
                                      it pink. But if people ask for something
                                      or really love something which is gender
                                      specific (rose perfume for example) then I
                                      will get it, because that&#8217;s about
                                      preference not obligation.<\/p>\n

                                            I think that a lot of pressure will
                                            come from family and social circles
                                            at this time of year, more so than
                                            the media. I dislike a lot of
                                            adverts and articles aimed at
                                            &#8220;the woman cooking&#8221; or
                                            &#8220;manly gifts&#8221;, or
                                            &#8220;pink for girls, blue for
                                            boys&#8221;, but I do think
                                            it&#8217;s starting to get a

                                              society is so media saturated,
                                              that I don&#8217;t even really see

                                                careful to share the tasks like
                                                shopping and cooking (they are
                                                both feminists themselves), so I
                                                think I don&#8217;t see a lot of
                                                the feminist issues around the
                                                holidays, because I have very
                                                little experience of them. Our
                                                friends don&#8217;t stress us
                                                out or insinuate that there is a
                                                certain way one should be
                                                acting, so I have always found
                                                Christmas to be quite
                                                enjoyable.<\/p>\n<div
