<p>
  If you use Twitter, chances are you\u2019ll have clicked on a hashtag listed
  under the \u2018trending\u2019 (i.e. most popular) topics sidebar at least
  once. And perhaps only once \u2013 I can see why you might never do it again,
  especially if you clicked on
  <strong
    >#rulesforgirls<\/strong> or
    <strong
      >#ihatefemaleswho<\/strong>.<\/p>\n
      <p>
        Here are some examples of standard fare, from apparently male users.
        Apologies. They\u2019re pretty grim.<\/p>\n

      <blockquote>
        <p>#aGOODWOMAN knows how to shut the fuck up!!!!!!<\/p>\n</p>
        <p>#agoodwoman is always ready to give head!<\/p>\n</p>
        <p>
          #Agoodwoman cooks for u when u get in from work and gets up and cooks
          breakfast when u leavin to go to work<\/p>\n

        <p>
          when y&#8217;all cheat, expect for it to be over&#8230; when us men
          cheat, you have to be forgiving and give us another chance&#8230;

        <p>
          #rulesforgirls When we say we wana watch football, that means no
          cleaning,no talking,NO FORM OF INTERACTION.We will Chris Brown

          back<\/p><\/blockquote>\n
        </p>
        <p>And my two favourites, from the same guy:<\/p>\n</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>

            bitch, acknowledge it!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            You tell her! Why on earth would she want to be a man? *scratches
            head*<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              #IHateFemales Who don&#8217;t see the beauty in them &amp; still
              don&#8217;t take care of their bodies &amp; looking
              decent.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              Why can\u2019t she see how beautiful she is? And maybe get a
              wax?<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              These make for depressing reading, and when you\u2019re faced with
              a whole screenful and 60 more appear in a few minutes, it\u2019s
              easy to feel hopeless.\u00a0 But I don\u2019t think what
              we\u2019re watching is a misogynist Twitter takeover as some
              people have suggested. So what\u2019s going on? I\u2019ll start
              with some theories I have encountered and explain why I don\u2019t
              think they\u2019ll do as an answer.<\/p>\n

                chose to pass on to the room of feminists was to be careful of
                using Twitter because it\u2019s filling up with horrible geeky

                This comment on a blog post about hashtags clarified it for me:
                \u201cI wish I understood how and why stupid hashtags become
                trending topics.\u201d<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>Um. Because they\u2019re popular?<\/p>\n</p>
              <p>
                Sorry everyone, I know you don\u2019t want to hear this, but

                  >is<\/em> people with misogynist views, at least if the
                  trending topics are anything to go by.\u00a0I would hazard
                  that Twitter might\u00a0feel\u00a0like a feminist space that
                  has been invaded by these &#8216;orrible &#8216;ashtags
                  because you follow feminists. But we&#8217;re in the minority,
                  just like in Real Life.<\/p>\n

                    It\u2019s much easier to craft your own media bubble online

                        <em

                                      that logic you might think that every

                                      besides, there\u2019s plenty of misogyny

                                      I\u2019ve seen a number of people describe
                                      trending topics hashtag streams as the
                                      &#8216;dark undercurrent&#8217; or
                                      \u2018dark side\u2019 of Twitter.\u00a0 I
                                      don\u2019t think for a second that they

                                      nonetheless. There are some fascinating
                                      (and sometimes toe-curling) discussions
                                      going on at the moment about \u2018<a

                                      I think it\u2019s safe to say that there
                                      is greater uptake of the attitudes and
                                      poses of hip hop and R&amp;B \u2013 genres
                                      notorious for misogyny and heavily
                                      polarised gender stereotypes &#8211; in
                                      the young African American twitter
                                      demographic than there is in, say, the
                                      middle-aged white British demographic, and
                                      that\u2019s probably part of it.<\/p>\n

                                      But before you try and tell me that black
                                      people invented sexism (that must be why
                                      wholesome family entertainers like Jim
                                      Davidson hate them so much!) I recommend
                                      reading this 1994 article on <a

                                        I think it\u2019s also about the hashtag
                                        format. It\u2019s a joke, and
                                        there\u2019s an age-old link between
                                        cheap gags and crude gender stereotypes.

                                        controversial opinions than they might

                                        But I can\u2019t help feeling that
                                        there\u2019s more to it than a web 2.0
