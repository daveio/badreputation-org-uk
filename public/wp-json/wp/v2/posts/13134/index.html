  Sinclair in about 1916<\/p><\/div>\n
</p>
<p>
  Born in 1863 and a celebrated author in her lifetime, Sinclair has,\u00a0like
  so many women writers,\u00a0been largely forgotten, despite her close
  friendships with some of modernism&#8217;s poster boys: Ezra Pound, Ford Madox
  Ford, Robert Frost, and others. She was an early champion of T.S. Eliot and
  the first critic to use the term \u201cstream of consciousness\u201d to
  describe a literary technique.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  Rather brilliantly, Sinclair also campaigned for women to get the vote, and in
  1912 wrote a pamphlet called \u2018Feminism\u2019 which argued for
  women\u2019s equal potential for intellectual endeavour and political
  engagement. Her feminism seems to have been rather <a
  href=\"http:\/\/finallyfeminism101.wordpress.com\/2007\/05\/10\/faq-but-men-and-women-are-born-different-isnt-that-obvious\/\"
  target=\"_blank\">essentialist<\/a>, but she was still a powerful voice for
  equality at a time when women were routinely denied the vote, an education,
  economic independence or sexual agency.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  Sinclair had no formal education, although she read widely and developed an
  interest in psychoanalysis, philosophy and mysticism in particular. She
  attended Cheltenham Ladies College for a year before leaving to care for her
  four brothers who all had a hereditary heart defect. In spite of this, she
  wrote a dozen novels including bleak
  <i
    >bildungsroman<\/i>
    <b
      ><a
      href=\"http:\/\/bookssnob.wordpress.com\/2010\/06\/18\/the-life-and-death-of-harriett-frean-by-may-sinclair\/\">The
      Life and Death of Harriett Frean<\/a><\/b>, essays, poems and short
      stories before the onset of Parkinson\u2019s disease prevented her from
      writing.<\/p>\n
      <p>
        She died in 1946, having already drifted into obscurity. However, her
        literary significance as a pioneer of feminism and modernism is starting
        to be recognised, as this <a
        href=\"http:\/\/zhiv.wordpress.com\/2011\/06\/03\/about-may-sinclair\/\">great
        post<\/a> points out: \u201cHer work is good, even great, and it covers
        all the stops. It fits quite neatly in between George Eliot and Virginia
        Woolf, and she can serve well as a missing link.\u201d<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        I stumbled upon Sinclair entirely by accident when I picked up her 1923
        collection
        <b
          ><a
          href=\"http:\/\/editorial-consultancy.co.uk\/uncanny-stories-by-may-sinclair\/\">Uncanny
          Stories<\/a><\/b>, which is where the horror connection comes in.
          There\u2019s a near-complete copy available on <a
          href=\"http:\/\/books.google.co.uk\/books?id=C4zenPYcYDEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\">Google
          Books<\/a> if you want to check it out, although it\u2019s missing one
          of my favourites.<\/p>\n
          <p>
            Sinclair\u2019s letters show that her idea for the title predates
            the publication of Freud&#8217;s essay
            <b
              ><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Uncanny\">The
              Uncanny<\/a> <\/b>by nearly a decade, but she seems to have
              welcomed the coincidence and it\u2019s certainly fitting. Her
              stories are intensely psychological; there is no gore or ghouls,
              but instead a creeping horror and eerie imagery, and a sense of
              claustrophobia which lingers long after you&#8217;ve finished
              reading.<\/p>\n
              <p>
                Some of the stories are intensely sad, such as \u2018If The Dead
                Knew\u2019, in which a son realises his dead mother has heard
                him tell others how he had secretly hated her:<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <p>
                  Something compelled him to turn round and look towards his
                  mother\u2019s chair.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>Then he saw her.<\/p>\n</p>
                <p>
                  She stood between him and the chair, straight and thin,
                  dressed in the clothes she had died in, the yellowish flannel
                  nightgown and bed jacket.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  The apparition maintained itself with difficulty. Already its
                  hair had grown indistinct, a cap of white mist. Its face was
                  an insubstantial framework for its mouth and eyes, and for the
                  tears that fell in two shining tracks between. It was less a
                  form than a visible emotion, an anguish.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  Hollyer stood and stared at it. Through the glasses of its
                  tears it gazed back at him with an intense, a terrible
                  reproach and sorrow.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  Then, slowly and stiffly, it began to recede from him, drawn
                  back and back, without any movement of its feet, in an
                  unearthly stillness, keeping up, to the last minute, its look
                  of indestructible reproach.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  And now it was a formless mass that drifted to the window and
                  hung there a second, and passed, shrinking like a breath on
                  the pane.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  But other tales are comic. In \u2018The Victim\u2019, a
                  ghostly visitation to a murderer isn&#8217;t full of reproach,
                  but thanks &#8211; for freeing the victim from his
                  debts.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sinclair\u2019s themes and imagery chime with many of the
                  ideas popularised by Freud. Earlier in &#8216;If the Dead
                  Knew&#8217; the central character Hollyer is alarmed to
                  discover he wishes his mother would die:<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    In the dark, secret places of the mind your thoughts ran
                    loose beyond your knowing: they burrowed under the walls
                    that shut off one self from another; they got through. It
                    was as if his secret self had broken
                    loose.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You are the unconscious mind and I claim my five
                    pounds.<\/p>\n
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Founding a literary tradition which would later include
                    Elizabeth Bowen and Margaret Atwood, Sinclair\u2019s uncanny
                    stories feature divided and dislocated selves, the dance of
                    impulse and resistance and the hidden tracks and traces of
                    memory and unspoken desire. And as <a
                    href=\"http:\/\/etheses.dur.ac.uk\/3691\/\">Philippa
                    Martindale<\/a> explains, these stories are particularly
                    concerned with feminine and feminist experience:<\/p>\n
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>
                      Sinclair\u2019s uncanny fiction is a subtle tool for
                      feminist expression, deconstructing patriarchal paradigms
                      of power&#8230; Her uncanny stories serve as a forum for
                      &#8216;deviant&#8217; subjects, addressing cultural issues
                      such as female desire, sexuality, and gender
                      roles.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n

                    <p>
                      When I first read the collection, it reminded me of Daphne

                        part because most of the stories concern relationships
                        between men and women. Martindale highlights the
                        \u201csense of struggle for mastery between
                        Sinclair&#8217;s male and female protagonists, typically
                        played out in the sexual arena.\u201d One of the best
                        examples is \u2018Where Their Fire Is Not
                        Quenched\u2019, which deals at once with the fantastic
                        and the horrifically mundane as a former couple are
                        compelled to eternally repeat their loveless affair in a
                        shabby hotel room in the afterlife.<\/p>\n
                        <p>
                          On the subject of ghost stories, Sinclair herself
                          said:<\/p>\n
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                          <p>
                            Ghosts have their own atmospheres and their own
                            reality, they also have their setting in the
                            everyday reality we know; the story-teller is
                            handling two realities at the same
                            time.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            For me it is this touching of two worlds which makes
                            ghost stories so thrilling. The idea of something
                            surfacing or reaching through, reaching back is
                            unsettling and deeply uncanny. Sinclair\u2019s
                            protagonists find themselves at points where the
                            membrane between the natural and supernatural, life
                            and afterlife, the conscious and unconscious has
                            grown thin.<\/p>\n
