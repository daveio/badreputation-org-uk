                the pop-punk theme from number 6 (Skye Sweetnam), here&#8217;s
                Hayley Williams, demanding that you GO GET YOUR SHOVEL so that
                we can BURY THE CASTLE. Heavy handed and earnest the sentiment
                may be, but I won&#8217;t hear anything against it. Never did
                like the video much &#8211; it&#8217;s like a depressing version
                of the <a
                href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FUQCQ0LMsb8\">1980s
                Clarks Magic Steps shoes ad<\/a> (remember that?). Hayles is a
                ball of energy when she sings live, but here she spends most of
                the sequence dolefully marooned on a giant swing while her
                younger self gets lost in a castle &#8211; but the song&#8217;s
                catchy as hell. BA-DA-BA BA-DA-BA-BA-DA!, etc. <\/p>\n

                                      here. This vid, on the surface, is a
                                      standard fluffy fairytale wedding sequence
                                      with some added bling. But it contains
                                      some little touches that made me smile
                                      &#8211; like the Disney-style manuscript
                                      page at the start:

                                        instead, we find her dolling up in a

                                            consort). It&#8217;s also a nice
                                            touch that Minaj plays her own fairy
                                            godmother in the opening preamble,
                                            and that it&#8217;s not clear what
                                            either of them wants (though I
                                            concede this also owes quite a bit
                                            to the bewildering mixture of clunky
                                            dialogue, pointless Minaj fanbase
                                            in-jokes, and a cringingly bad
                                            attempt at a Brit accent). Thanks to
                                            these little quirks, the whole
                                            vid&#8217;s a slightly
                                            left-of-centre affair, and much the
                                            better for it. Within the parameters
                                            of what she&#8217;s doing, Nicki
                                            Minaj is doing genuinely interesting
                                            things, and making great pop to
