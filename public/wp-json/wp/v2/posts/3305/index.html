<p>My model engine has arrived!<\/p>\n</p>
<p>
  Let me tell you about it. It is a simplified, reasonably accurate version of a
  four-stroke engine, and it comes with its very own Haynes manual. It\u2019s
  also entirely plastic and aimed at ages 10+. Bollocks, I say. If I had kids
  that age, I wouldn\u2019t let them anywhere near the thing with their wickedly
  sharp craft knives. They&#8217;d have their fingers off before the first tea
  break.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_3776\" style=\"width: 310px\"

  model internal combustion engine. Like Airfix, only not.<\/p><\/div>\n
</p>
<p>
  Let me back up a bit. <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/2011\/02\/17\/secret-diary-of-a-female-petrolhead\/\">A
  few months ago, I decided that I was going to learn about engines.<\/a>
  I\u2019ve always been a bit hazy on the theory behind internal combustion, and
  despite my father\u2019s repeated attempts to explain, I\u2019ve never really
  been able to get it straight in my head. This could have something to do with
  his insistence on explaining over the dinner table, rather than opening up the
  bonnet of his car and explaining there. (My brother got the lecture over the
  open bonnet of the car.
  <em
    >He<\/em> got so bored he fell asleep.)<\/p>\n
    <p>
      This will all be a lot easier to grasp if I can actually do it myself. If
      I can take apart an engine and put it back together, you can be reasonably
      certain that I\u2019ll know how it works afterwards. OK, maybe I\u2019ll
      explode the back garden a couple of times, but I\u2019ve accepted that as
      an inevitable consequence.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Miraculously, my new-found zeal is shared by a colleague of mine. She,
      too, wants to strip down an engine and see what makes it tick. Excellent!
      We ordered a plastic model to assemble in order to get a vague idea of
      what it will all involve, before thinking about taking things a little
      further. While we waited for the model to arrive, we may have become a
      little\u2026 unruly. Rowdy. Noisy. Obnoxious? Surely not!<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      After one of our exchanges, a colleague came up to me. She works in HR.
      You know the type: perfect hair, perfect nails, perfect smile. Was my
      enthusiasm too, er, enthusiastic?<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      \u201cI just wanted to say, what you\u2019re doing is fantastic,\u201d she
      murmured quietly, and straightened the strand of pearls at her neck.
      \u201cI love my car, I\u2019d kill any fucker who so much as touched it.
      There\u2019s nothing quite like a good engine purring, you
      know?\u201d<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>I didn\u2019t know, actually, but I nodded just the same.<\/p>\n</p>
    <p>
      The next day, another colleague was delivering some papers over my lunch
      hour when she saw the driving lessons website open in my browser.
      \u201cOh, are you learning to drive? Good for you! I learned in Nairobi, I
      thought I\u2019d be quite frightened and sedate but it turned out I was a
      real girl racer, I nearly failed because I was speeding the entire
      time\u2026\u201d<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      I\u2019m guessing that speeding will not be encouraged in London.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, colleague Y came up to me, very upset, and drew me away from
      my desk. \u201cI heard that you and colleague X are rebuilding an
      engine!\u201d she said, looking very upset. Well, yes. Was this against
      her ethical beliefs? Was I in trouble with the \u2018cycle to work\u2019
      initiative?<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you invite me?\u201d<\/p>\n</p>
    <p>
      The thing is, I haven\u2019t really mentioned this that much at work,
      despite being giddy with it for months. The people that have found out
      about it have either nodded sagely about how many times I&#8217;ll set
      myself on fire, or raved about how brilliant it all is. Invariably, my
      young female colleagues have fallen into the latter category. They\u2019ve
      also taken the opportunity to ask me what I thought about the new Pagani
      (undecided, and I miss the Zonda R), the One-77 (I do like it, but why is
      it so angry? It looks like it\u2019s been munching on stray pets) and
      plus, wouldn\u2019t it be nice if the off-road vehicles didn\u2019t kill
      your spine every time you went off road? (Seriously, Toyota, sort it out.)
      All of this was delivered in hushed tones over the tea and coffee, and by
      the time we were back at our desks we were very firmly back on either the
      Sudan referendum or the receptionist\u2019s new hairstyle.<\/p>\n<div

    <p>
      Why? Was what we were talking about so shocking that it wasn\u2019t fit
      for general consumption? Would the office spontaneously explode if it
      turned out that the female accountants and aid workers in my organisation
      actually knew their Nissans from their Nobles? Why did they get so
      embarrassed talking about it?<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      \u201cWell,\u201d colleague X said philosophically, \u201cI didn\u2019t
      get into cars before because I thought that it was a traditional male
      thing. And that didn\u2019t mean that I couldn\u2019t do it, but blokes
      would know more about it than me starting off, and I didn\u2019t want to
      feel stupid. Then it turned out that they knew just as little as I
      did.\u201d<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Two hours later, a male colleague decided to ask condescendingly what kind
      of engine we\u2019d be rebuilding. Would it be, he said, sneering, a
      rotating one?<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;A Wankel rotary?&#8221; I asked. No. It would be a
      four-stroke.<\/p>\n
