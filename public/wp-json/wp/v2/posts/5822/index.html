<p>
  If you\u2019ve been wondering where I\u2019ve been for the last few months,
  well, I have been cunningly hidden in Africa. Before that, I was busy doing
  Secret Projects that had little, if anything, to do with creative and positive
  things like rebuilding an engine or learning how to drive. Instead, they were
  altogether more likely to fall over, slice my head off, or explode.
  Potentially all at once.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  Yes, that\u2019s right. On a bright March day, full of steak and ale pie, I
  signed up to learn the noble art of marshalling.<\/p>\n<div

  art of marshalling. Not pictured: fire.<\/p><\/div>\n
</p>
<p>
  If you don\u2019t know what a race marshal does, think back to any Formula 1
  or MotoGP race you may have seen. When the inevitable fireball appeared,
  little figures in bright orange ran straight into it to drag out the driver
  and put out the fire. Yup. Those are race marshals.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  On a rainy day in February, I wrote an email to the Motor Sports Association,
  saying I\u2019d quite like to get involved in marshalling. Fast forward a few
  days, and Bob from the MSA emailed me to invite me to a training day a couple
  of weeks later. Someone from a local club, he said, Will Be In Touch. I was
  instantly filled with bone-crushing terror.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  Oh, God. I was going to be contacted by an Eddie or a Chas or a Kev, and they
  were going to ask whether I wanted to hand out brochures or something.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  Instead, I received a very nice email from Mildred, giving me the details of
  the training day, and asking if I would be needing lunch, and would I make
  sure to email Anne my contact details. In my head, I was suddenly headed to a
  wayward chapter of the WI, complete with jam sandwiches.<\/p>\n<div

  class=\"wp-caption-text\">Marshalling: like the WI, but with extra
  explosions.<\/p><\/div>\n
</p>
<p>
  The actual training day was bloody terrifying, and more than a little
  bewildering. I mean, MARSHALLING, seriously. It\u2019s like those strange
  people that take up a new hobby and devote an entire room in the house to it.
  You know it\u2019s not gonna end well. The pre-reading was also not
  encouraging: marshalling introduction, incident response theory, fire theory,
  fire practical, flags theory\u2026 Hey, did anyone spot the fire practical in
  there? Me too.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  Before that, though, there was mostly a whole lot of PowerPoint (mostly of
  explosions), lists of kit (mostly of the flame-retardant variety), and Golden
  Rules (when there is carbon fibre flying at your head, duck or be
  decapitated). About halfway through the day, having been fed a proper meal of
  pie and chips, I found myself bent double and touching my toes while a large
  man peered critically at my bum. \u201cWell?\u201d I asked him
  anxiously.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  He hissed and tipped his head to the right. \u201cNo,\u201d he said finally.
  \u201cYou definitely want the other one.\u201d<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  In the manner of personal shoppers everywhere, he was helping me pick my
  perfect outfit: a hi-vis, flame-retardant overall. They come in one colour
  (bright orange) and two styles (cheap-without-pockets and
  expensive-with-pockets). The main thing to get right is the size. Too big is
  not good, because you can catch it on stray bits of car, ripping the fabric.
  Too small is disastrous, as it impedes movement when staying nimble is
  important for maintaining a normal life expectancy. You wear the overalls over
  at least one, and possibly up to four, layers of clothing. You work in them,
  eat in them, and occasionally fall asleep on the way home in them.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  Very occasionally, you will have to evade flying bits of car in them.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  My outfit properly selected, I tied up my hair, kitted up in fireproof hi-vis,
  donned my giant welder\u2019s gauntlets, and joined my fellow trainees in the
  woods around Brands Hatch, where a car had been set alight for our
  benefit.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  Can I just say, THIS. THIS IS HOW FIRE TRAINING IS SUPPOSED TO BE DONE. No
  longer will I accept ridiculous PowerPoint presentations of the correct way to
  remove the safety thingie from a fire extinguisher. Set something on fire and
  shove me at it to get some damn practice in! It was ruddy marvellous.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  So, marshalling: surprisingly awesome. And it turned out that I wasn\u2019t
  the only woman there, which was a major relief. Of the sixty or so new
  trainees present, just over a tenth were women. (Interesting demographic
  titbit: while the men spanned all socioeconomic ranges and ages from 14 to 64,
  the women were primarily professionals in their late twenties and early
  thirties.) The practical teams were pretty mixed, and our own team was 50\/50
  male\/female. So it was an odd thing that, when the day wound down and we all
  gathered around several big tables to be fed some caffeine before the drive
  home, all the women trainees had somehow congregated around one table. Without
  even asking or discussing, we had all got out our phones and exchanged contact
  details. Afterwards, my personal shopper came up to me.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d he asked anxiously. \u201cOnly, I noticed that
  you all went\u2026away.\u201d He gestured vaguely at the Women Only
  table.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  Truthfully, I hadn\u2019t even noticed until he\u2019d pointed it out. The
  funny thing was, everything
  <em
    >was<\/em> okay. The day had been brilliant, full of new things to do, plus
    bonus cars-on-fire, and I hadn\u2019t felt awkward or out of place even
    once. But, in the end, the ratio had won out, and we\u2019d all gravitated
    towards each other.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_8989\" style=\"width: 310px\"

    <p>
      Since then, personal shopper and I have become pretty good friends.
      We\u2019ve been to several race meets together, and coordinate travelling
      to the track. There have been many adventures, and when I stop being on
      fire and\/or decapitated I shall finish writing them all up. But somehow,
      strangely, I still recognise those women I met for just a few hours those
      months ago. Partly it\u2019s because we shared a profound experience of
      alienation in a testosterone-driven, male-dominated field, despite
      everyone\u2019s best intentions.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      But mostly it\u2019s because we all have to get changed into our kit in
      the ladies\u2019 loos at the main paddock, and there\u2019s only three
      bloody cubicles in there.<\/p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy
