  I know we finished the surprising <a

  series<\/a> a while back, but I just watched
  <strong
    >Hairspray<\/strong> again and had such a familiar rush of affection I
    thought it was time to put pen to paper. Fingers to keyboard. You know what
    I mean.<\/p>\n
    <p>
      I\u2019ve never seen the more recent musical film version because I love
      the original so much, but I\u2019d be interested to hear what BadReppers
      think of it. If you\u2019ve not seen the real thing, here\u2019s the

                &#8216;Pleasantly Plump&#8217; teenager Tracy Turnblad achieves
                her dream of becoming a regular on the Corny Collins Dance Show.
                Now a teen hero, she starts using her fame to speak out for the
                causes she believes in, most of all integration. In doing so,
                she earns the wrath of the show&#8217;s former star, Amber Von
                Tussle, as well as Amber&#8217;s manipulative, pro-segregation
                parents. The rivalry comes to a head as Amber and Tracy vie for
                the title of Miss Auto Show 1963.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n

                cover it. It\u2019s a delirious, high-camp, queer, irreverent
                and satirical version of the early 60s that shows
                <strong
                  >Dirty Dancing<\/strong> up as the insipid whitewashed pap
                  that it is. (Sorry, but you know I&#8217;m speaking the
                  truth.) Tracy Turnblad, played by Ricki Lake, is a heroine and
                  a half. Big, happy, confident, working class Tracy has a lot
                  of soul and a keen sense of justice. She wins the day, the
                  guy, and the hearts of the town because she can dance, because
                  she\u2019s nice and because she stands up for what she
                  believes in. In this case: civil rights.<\/p>\n
                  <p>
                    What is so refreshing to see even now (perhaps especially
                    now) is a large teenage female character who radiates energy
                    and self-confidence. She\u2019s not a sidekick, she\u2019s
                    the star through and through, and the Elvis-a-like
                    heartthrob falls head over heels for her, as does everyone
                    else. When she dances in triumph with her chain of friends
                    at the end of the film I DEFY YOU not to be cheering her
                    on.<\/p>\n

                    me and makes me think \u2018why the hell not?\u2019 She
