<p>
  Way back in the primordial mists of 2007, I was hastily writing a dissertation
  for my Gender Studies Masters. I didn\u2019t know it then of course, but that
  same dissertation would later turn out to be actually almost quite
  useful.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  What I was writing about was UK press representation of trafficking for sexual
  exploitation. Or rather, misrepresentation. There were also some heady
  cultural studies bits about nations and bodies and identity and stuff, but the
  heart of the 15,000 word beast was some research showing that the key elements
  in coverage of so-called \u2018white slavery\u2019 in the 19th century were
  all present and correct in current newspaper coverage of sex trafficking. I
  summarised some of that in <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/2012\/07\/16\/white-slavery-\u2026k-press-part-1\/\">my
  previous post<\/a>.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  Some recent articles, and an exciting conference on the same subject organised
  by the <a title=\"CAWN\" href=\"http:\/\/www.cawn.org\/\"
  target=\"_blank\">Central American Women\u2019s Network<\/a> (at which I was
  invited to speak, eek) have put this cheery topic back on my radar. After
  talking to people studying the same issues today, it seems that nothing much
  has changed since 2007, and in fact the situation has got worse.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  Discourse (yes, I said it, I went there! And in the fourth paragraph too!)
  around sex trafficking is dominated by a single story which has been repeated
  so often it has become a clich\u00e9, despite its distressing content. You
  probably know it: virginal 15 year old Albanian blonde is promised a job as a
  waitress, or maybe even kidnapped, and when she arrives in the UK she is
  beaten and raped and forced to work as a prostitute.<\/p>\n

  \/><\/a>This is real. It does happen. And amazing but severely under-funded
  organisations like the <a title=\"Poppy Project\"
  href=\"http:\/\/www.eaves4women.co.uk\/POPPY_Project\/POPPY_Project.php\"
  target=\"_blank\">Eaves Housing Poppy Project<\/a> can tell you about it,
  because they spend every day picking up the pieces.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  The trouble is that this single story obscures the complex interrelationship
  of migration, trafficking, and the national and international sex industry,
  and the many and various routes of women into exploitation. It has helped to
  establish a set of criteria for \u2018legitimate victimhood\u2019 for women
  who have been trafficked, which excludes a huge number of serious cases and
  obscures the wider problems faced by women in the sex trade.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  As an example, a 2007 headline in the
  <strong
    >Sunday Express<\/strong> screams \u201cInflux of sex slaves hits UK\u201d.
    We are told that the Home Office is \u201cstruggling to cope with an influx
    of women immigrants who are being forced into prostitution\u201d. However,
    several lines down we find the kernel of news the article has grown from:
    \u201cHome Office figures about to be published will claim that 4,000 new
    foreign women join the UK sex trade every year.\u201d The categories of
    migrant women working in the UK sex trade and victims of sex trafficking are
    collapsed into one without any word of explanation. In fact it is unknown
    how many of these women have been forced into prostitution. It is unlikely
    to be 100%.<\/p>\n
    <p>
      Because the media, the police, the government and &#8211; sadly &#8211; a
      number of campaigns have focused so narrowly on kidnap and involuntary
      prostitution, migrant women working in the sex trade can find themselves
      unable to access services when their human rights have been abused. As an
      example: consider a woman who willingly enters the UK sex trade, but finds
      that she is forced to hand over all her earnings to her pimp, has no
      ability to refuse customers and is prevented from leaving. That is
      slavery, whether she comes from Thailand, Moldova or Bromley.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      By conjuring a moral panic based on a discourse of innocence, border
      violations and kidnap, the media, government and police fail to engage
      with the risks and problems surrounding \u2018domestic\u2019 prostitution.
      This means that many women working in prostitution continue to be failed
      by a State that does not offer them protection.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      There is another damaging side effect of the repetition and emphasis on
      this story at the exclusion of all others. If the measure of whether a
      woman is a \u2018sex slave\u2019 or not excludes many or even most women
      in that situation, it becomes simple enough for people to say <a
      href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/uk\/2009\/oct\/20\/government-trafficking-enquiry-fails\">there
      is no problem<\/a>.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      And it seems that by following the version of sex trafficking peddled by
      the press too closely the police are at risk of missing countless
      vulnerable women. I was pleased to see an alternative, more informed
      narrative in this otherwise dismaying recent <a
      href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/uk\/2012\/mar\/19\/met-police-sex-trafficking-investigations-criticised\">article<\/a>\u00a0about
      a report criticising the Met for their hamfisted policing of trafficking
      for sexual exploitation, which seems to consist mostly of raiding brothels
      and asking women if they\u2019ve been trafficked. The report (<a
      title=\"Silence on Violence\"
      href=\"http:\/\/glaconservatives.co.uk\/campaigns\/silence-on-violence\/\"
      target=\"_blank\">&#8220;Silence on Violence&#8221;<\/a>) is worth a read,
      even though it was produced by GLA Conservatives.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Disappointing then that the next day the <a
      href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/lifeandstyle\/2012\/mar\/19\/nowhere-to-turn-britains-sex-slaves?CMP=twt_gu\">same
      old story<\/a> was being told in the same paper. It\u2019s a moving
      account of a terrible experience endured by a courageous woman, and I
      applaud the
      <strong
        >Guardian<\/strong> for covering the issue and for closely consulting
        the excellent Eaves Housing Poppy Project. But we need to tell some of
        the other stories too, or women will continue to be measured against it
        and found to be less of a victim than they should be.<\/p>\n
