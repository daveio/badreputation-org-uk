                  title=\"A link to an\narticle about masculinity on Bad
                  Reputation - a feminist pop culture adventure\">Sarah
                  C&#8217;s blogpost yesterday<\/a>, I wanted to ask: who
                  decides what it is to &#8220;be a man&#8221;? And why is the
                  answer vital to improving things for women?<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is not just about Alpha Males, but our entire definition
                  of masculinity (and therefore what we&#8217;re telling boys
                  and men they should aim to be). We can talk about being a
                  responsible adult, but how is that different from
                  &#8216;manly&#8217;? <\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  We haven&#8217;t moved on very much from celebrating men as
                  muscle-bound warriors, from equating manliness with
                  <em
                    >physical<\/em> strength. Nerds are not manly. Thin,
                    &#8216;weak&#8217; guys are not manly. The efficient office
                    worker is not &#8216;manly&#8217;. The patient father is not
                    praised with &#8220;What a man!&#8221; Anyone with the wrong
                    body shape can never qualify.<\/p>\n
                    <p>
                      Manliness also requires independence: you&#8217;re not a
                      successful man if you live in your Mother&#8217;s
                      basement, but men who own motorbikes or fast cars are
                      sexy. It goes beyond this, though. You&#8217;re not manly
                      if you&#8217;re ruled primarily by tender emotions, or
                      &#8220;under the thumb&#8221; of a woman, or
                      &#8211;<\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Sorry, I just can&#8217;t keep this up. It&#8217;s such
                      utter, utter bullshit. The short answer seems to be:
                      you&#8217;re not a man unless you control your own
                      destiny. If others are in charge of you, or you submit to
                      them, then they are above you on the Manliness
                      Scale.<\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      And we wonder why the entire planet is in danger.<\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      It&#8217;s as though the capability to fight and take
                      &#8211; and therefore provide &#8211; is still the only
                      measure of what makes a man. Male aggression is not
                      popular in modern society (outside of sports, boardrooms
                      and the army) but Sarah C referred to some websites
                      yesterday which celebrate a particularly horrible version
                      of poisonous alpha male tropes. Their vision consists of
                      controlling your women (multiple), being in command, being
                      admired for being powerful, and taking it easy while your
                      slaves do the work because you&#8217;re the big
                      man.<\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      It&#8217;s pretty strange to see that this still exists in
                      an allegedly modern country. These men seem to think they
                      can be less powerless in life if they take imagined power
                      from women around them. A big part of it lies in
                      succeeding specifically
                      <em
                        >because<\/em> you have lowered a woman&#8217;s power
                        from a perceived higher place. Femininity is seen as
                        making men weak, and women are assumed to be always less
                        powerful (making any example of them EVER overruling the
                        alpha an unacceptable demonstration of the alpha&#8217;s
                        weakness.)<\/p>\n
                        <p>
                          So why is this commanding behaviour not only
                          acceptable, respected, sought-after, but the
                          definition of masculine prowess?<\/p>\n
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Some sources believe it&#8217;s because <a
                          href=\"http:\/\/thelastpsychiatrist.com\/2010\/09\/when_was_the_last_time_you_got.html\">fighting
                          is the one thing you can&#8217;t fake.<\/a> It&#8217;s
                          also the action which overrules all others: it
                          doesn&#8217;t matter how deserving, wise or honourable
                          you are, someone with a bigger gun can take it all
                          away. So maybe it&#8217;s about security, and
                          therefore defence of loved ones, rather than the more
                          pessimistic approach of valuing someone primarily for
                          their ability to attack.<\/p>\n
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          What&#8217;s interesting is that this Conan image
                          comes more from the media and movies than reality. A
                          quick poll of some female friends found that they
                          mainly think &#8220;manly&#8221; means having
                          <em
                            >Values, Character, Responsibility<\/em>&#8230;
                            behaviours which suggest you are not just a boy in
                            adult clothes. The change is from a child to an
                            adult, not to being more
                            <em
                              >male<\/em> than before.<\/p>\n
                              <p>
                                But the images and lessons boys receive from TV
                                and cinema simply cannot equate maturity with
                                manliness unless the man can also kick the ass
                                of everyone onscreen. And be totally 100%
                                heterosexual, of course. (In the same poll, one
                                woman said she&#8217;d think less of a man if he
                                wasn&#8217;t physically stronger than her, so
                                it&#8217;s not all one-sided.) Even here,
                                &#8216;feminine&#8217; qualities are seen as
                                taking away from a man&#8217;s masculinity. And
                                since &#8216;feminine&#8217; is deemed
                                inseparable from a woman&#8217;s perfect role of
                                being a (usually married) mother, that means men
                                are deemed less manly if they show any nurturing
                                behaviour towards kids, are emotionally
                                sensitive, etc etc oh god this is
                                depressing.<\/p>\n
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                Ultimately, masculinity is bound up with
                                <em
                                  >individual<\/em> heroism instead of having to
                                  rely on others, and that&#8217;s a dangerous
                                  place to be.<\/p>\n
                                  <p>
                                    It&#8217;s a sad trend for feminism that men
                                    are judged on what they
                                    <strong
                                      >do<\/strong>, and women are judged on how
                                      they
                                      <strong
                                        >look<\/strong>, but the male side of
                                        that is not as enabling as it appears.
                                        The target for masculinity has to
                                        include muscle, mastery and money. A
                                        man\u2019s worth (as a
                                        &#8220;successful&#8221; male and
                                        especially as relationship material) is
                                        very closely linked to his money. Not
                                        just the prestige of the job, but how
                                        far up the status ladder of it he is.
                                        Success and potential future success are
                                        what are really being measured, in
                                        whatever field. And it IS about wealth;
                                        that&#8217;s why status
                                        <em
                                          >symbols<\/em> work. They represent
                                          the money, and therefore the power, or
                                          his capability and drive to get
                                          power.<\/p>\n

                                            Who are the male role models on TV?
                                            Bling-laden hard men rappers
                                            surrounded by girls, secret agents
                                            who win every fight, footballers and
                                            movie stars. All of whom are alpha
                                            males who get the girls and status
