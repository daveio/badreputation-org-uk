  This is just a quick little post inspired by my recent visit to the Belle
  &amp; Sebastian merchandise website. I was all ready to buy a charming new <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.belleandsebastianshop.com\/product\/ladies_fox_in_the_snow_t-shirt\/\">twee-shirt<\/a>
  when I noticed that in this little corner of planet indiepop a UK size 12
  apparently constitutes &#8216;extra large&#8217;. I have no photographic
  record of the face I made, but here&#8217;s a <a
  href=\"http:\/\/images.cheezburger.com\/completestore\/2010\/10\/6\/d04c0380-60f3-4dc1-8775-a0c38781d281.jpg\">rough
  approximation<\/a>.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  This <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.fashion.arts.ac.uk\/research\/projects-collaborations\/size-uk\/\">survey<\/a>
  from 2004 places the UK average dress size for women at size 14. And yet a 12
  is not just &#8216;large&#8217; but &#8216;extra large&#8217;&#8230; something
  here doesn&#8217;t add up. I know the band probably have nothing to do with
  their merch, but I still felt disappointed. Aren&#8217;t we all shy indie
  outsiders together? Or are girls with curves not allowed to join the hairclip
  brigade?<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  I shouldn&#8217;t have been surprised, of course &#8211; every scene has its
  spoken or unspoken rules and standards, and just because they&#8217;re
  &#8216;alternative&#8217; in some ways doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re not
  deeply conventional in others. Besides, &#8216;indie = skinny&#8217; is well
  established. Here&#8217;s a nice comment on the Stereogum 2007 awards for
  &#8216;Ms Indie Rock Hotties&#8217; from the <a
  href=\"http:\/\/idolator.com\/333090\/the-ideal-indie-rock-woman-pale-malnourished-and-with-really-bad-bangs\">Idolator<\/a>:<\/p>\n
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    once again the winners&#8230; prove that when it comes to wank-mining
    material, your average indie-rocking male is looking for (gasp!) a skinny
    white girl with a shaggy haircut. Emphasis on the \u201cskinny.\u201d And
    did we mention the \u201cwhite\u201d? Aside from a few notable tokens
    exceptions, there are enough pointy elbows and too-sad-to-leave-the-house
    complexions here to fill up a year\u2019s worth of American Apparel
    advertisements. Way to reject mainstream standards of beauty, dudes! The guy
    hotties list also features many downy, bony gents, yet somehow offers a
    slightly wider range of body types than the chick list\u2019s parade of
    waifs.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n
  </p>
  <p>
    It also reminded me of a <a
    href=\"http:\/\/pennyred.blogspot.com\/2010\/01\/pretty-vacant-self-objectification-and.html\">post<\/a>
    by Laurie Penny from a couple of years back, about the prevalence and
    acceptance of self-objectification in alternative subcultures. As she says,
    \u201cthere is an assumption that misogyny and beauty fascism don&#8217;t
    count outside of the mainstream, that they don&#8217;t hurt.\u201d Penny
    also points out that the notion that getting your kit off is empowering for
    women is as readily accepted as it is in mainstream pop culture: \u201cthe
    idea being that because the young women with no clothes on aren&#8217;t
    necessarily blonde and permatanned, it&#8217;s all fine and dandy and edgy
    and exciting.\u201d<\/p>\n
  </p>
  <p>
    This stuff can still hurt, perhaps even more when it&#8217;s under the
    banner of quirky individualism; be as eccentric as you like, as long as
    you&#8217;re thin and sexy while you do it. EJ Dickson did a great\u00a0<a
    href=\"http:\/\/www.nerve.com\/entertainment\/zooey-deshanel\">post<\/a>\u00a0for
    Nerve about how the message to &#8216;be yourself&#8217;, so beloved of all
    kinds of alternative subcultures, can actually contain coded pressures to
    look and act a particular way when you are being dripfed an ideal, in this
    case Zooey Deschanel.<\/p>\n
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Would Zooey Deschanel have sex after eating a bucket of chicken wings?, I
      often wondered. Would she be self-conscious about the way her stomach
      looked while she was on top? The answers to these questions, of course,
      was invariably no, she would not: Zooey Deschanel would be thin and
      awesome during sex, and after she blew the guy&#8217;s mind she&#8217;d
      take out her ukulele and write a song about it.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Dickson is honest about the damage she did to her relationships with
      others in pursuit of the version of herself she felt she ought to be.
      People will always want to be attractive, whatever that means to them. But
      it feels like a lot of goths and punks and indie kids are missing the
      point if we just swap one set of impossible beauty standards for
      another.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Not for the first time I find myself wishing I&#8217;d had something
      like\u00a0<a
      href=\"http:\/\/www.mookychick.co.uk\/\">Mookychick<\/a>\u00a0when I was a
      teenager. Alongside tutorials on applying neon eyeshadow they have
      features about health, self esteem, and a whole section on
      alternative\u00a0<a
      href=\"http:\/\/www.mookychick.co.uk\/alternative-fashion\/plus-size-clothing\/\">plus
      size fashion<\/a>\u00a0including stockists.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      In case it&#8217;s useful for anyone out there struggling with body image
      issues and self esteem (and I think\u00a0everyone\u00a0does sometimes,
      surely), one thing I&#8217;ve found that helps me chillax and stop
      thinking about it is remembering that no one is studying me as hard as
      I&#8217;m studying myself. Most people won&#8217;t even notice whatever it
      is that&#8217;s bothering you, not least because they&#8217;re too wrapped
      up in their own lives and their body worries to care if your pores look
      big or your hips are cellulicious.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      It&#8217;s not easy, and I certainly haven&#8217;t cracked it, but one of
      the most radical choices you can make is to give up thinking you&#8217;re
      ugly.<\/p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div
