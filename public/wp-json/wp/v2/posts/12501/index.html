Hugs, or Markgraf&#8217;s Comic Convention Adventure"},"content":{"rendered":"
<p>
  If you&#8217;re reading this, I assume you know what a comic convention is.
  Right? Cool. We&#8217;re on the same page.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  You may also be aware of the FREE HUGS meme. It&#8217;s quite sweet: you hold
  a sign with &#8220;FREE HUGS&#8221; on it, and people can come to you to claim
  their free hug. Because free things are nice, hugs shouldn&#8217;t be charged
  for, and aaahhh and d&#8217;awww and other such sentiments. FREE HUGSing is
  very prevalent at comic conventions.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>Having set that up, let me tell you a tale.<\/p>\n</p>
<p>
  The scene: a large and popular comic convention held in a large and popular UK
  city. It&#8217;s spring, verging on summer, and it&#8217;s warm.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  Cosplayers roam the convention with absurdly large props and wigs, and excited
  teenagers clutch bags of stash from their favourite webcomic artists, faces
  flushed with glee. Someone is dressed as a cardboard box. Someone else has a
  large plush Totoro. Gangs of Stormtroopers march about, videogame demos blare
  and cameras flash.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  Numerous people saunter about, idly holding scraps of paper with &#8220;FREE
  HUGS&#8221; scrawled on them in pen, either because it&#8217;s what everyone
  is doing, or because they hope for a tiny scrap of human affection in this
  amazing sea of other people&#8217;s playtime.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>Something terrible jingles past.<\/p>\n</p>
<p>
  A long, thin, white jingling thing, with no real face and long tentacular
  horns. It has claws and hooves and no eyes and&#8230; a FREE HUGS sign all of
  its own.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_12554\" style=\"width: 322px\"

</p>
<p>Do you hug it?<\/p>\n</p>
<p>
  My costume monster, Babylon, is a non-gendered-but-femme creature, with no
  anthropomorphic secondary sex characteristics, but with performatively femme
  behaviour.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  Now, as it is rare for women to &#8220;perform&#8221; their femininity,
  performative femininity generally tends to be the preserve of people that
  don&#8217;t identify as women &#8211; because &#8220;performance&#8221;
  indicates a degree of &#8220;artifice&#8221;, and it is unusual for someone to
  &#8220;put on&#8221; the presentation that&#8217;s generally considered
  &#8220;appropriate&#8221; for their identity.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  (But of course, it does happen, because everything does, and identity and
  presentation are two different things and being a woman doesn&#8217;t make
  your presentation femme by default, so of course one
  <em
    >can<\/em> identify as female and also perform your
    femininity.\u00a0That&#8217;s a thing that happens too. I don&#8217;t need
    to explain these things to you: you know about stuff, you&#8217;re all down
    with this. Back to telling the tale.)<\/p>\n
    <p>
      So. Big, sparkly performance femme-ness is A Thing and a grand one at that
      &#8211; just, not necessarily tethered to a gender identity.\u00a0 So
      Babylon is very hard to read. It&#8217;s too over-the-top femme to be a
      girl, but surely boy monsters are big and spiky, right?<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Obviously, the answer is that Babylon is non-binary, but our average
      member of the public in need of a full Gender 101 isn&#8217;t going to
      assume that.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      I had lots of fun wearing Babylon during the convention, mostly because it
      is nice to dress as a monster, but also because I discovered a few
      interesting things about how people interact with an ungenderable
      non-human costume.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <ul>
      \n
      <li>
        Teenage girls with stripy armwarmers shrieked with delight at Babylon,
        largely gendered it male, and happily gave it hugs.<\/li>\n
      </li>
      <li>
        Women my age wanted photographs and loved Babylon&#8217;s boots.<\/li>\n
      </li>
      <li>
        Older steampunk gentlemen gendered it female and wanted
        photographs.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n
        <p>
          But the most hilarious demographic by far was teenage boys, and other
          men in costumes.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          Teenage boys roam in knots about conventions, all holding papery
          requests for hugs. Their knuckles blanched as their grip on their FREE
          HUGS signs tightened when Babylon indicated that their desire for hugs
          was the same, and came over to hug them.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh, they didn&#8217;t like it. Oh, teenage boys didn&#8217;t like the
          Babylon. Oh no.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          &#8220;What is it?&#8221; they said.<br \ />\n&#8220;Urgh,&#8221; they
          said.<br \ />\n&#8220;Oh man, it&#8217;s a
          <em
            >bloke<\/em>, mate,&#8221; they said.<\/p>\n
            <p>
              Babylon is not a bloke. I&#8217;m a bloke; Babylon is a Babylon.
              They didn&#8217;t want photographs.<\/p>\n<div style=\"width:

              You probably see where I&#8217;m going with this. My next example
              is brilliant.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              I Babyloned up to a group of Star Wars <a
              href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Stormtrooper_(Star_Wars)\"
              target=\"_blank\">Stormtroopers<\/a>. Now, I rather like masks and
              men in uniform, so I saw this as a brilliant opportunity to put
              the &#8220;play&#8221; into &#8220;cosplay&#8221; and be an alien
              at them. Which is what I did.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              Babylon jingled everywhere and posed for photographs, and one of
              the chaps, reading Babylon as female, got a bit saucy with it.
              This is fine, and Babylon, of course, sauced right back, all
              jingly silver bits and long talons &#8211; and then the
              Stormtrooper asked us, &#8220;Getting a bit hot are we,
              ma&#8217;am?&#8221;<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              Babylon made a surprised gesture (it doesn&#8217;t have a mouth)
              and indicated that he was wrong, and it wasn&#8217;t a
              &#8220;ma&#8217;am.&#8221;<\/p>\n

                >dude,<\/em>&#8221; and immediately stopped playing. He backed

                <p>
                  I wondered if this was the first time in his life that he had
                  ever had anyone he had not been sexually interested in being
                  flirtatious and forward at him.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  I idly thought about all the times I&#8217;ve been out with
                  lady friends of mine who&#8217;ve experienced street
                  harassment. Random strangers making sexual advances they
                  weren&#8217;t comfortable with. I suppressed the urge to tear
                  off my monster mask and bellow, &#8220;HUURARRRGGH, FEMINISM,
                  NYERRRGH&#8221; and spray liquid feminism at him from my
                  nipples.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  Remembering that I&#8217;ve been told that sort of behaviour
                  &#8220;hurts the cause&#8221;, I kept my mask on and flounced
                  off elsewhere.<\/p>\n

                <p>
                  What&#8217;s the moral to this post? There isn&#8217;t one,
                  really. It was just an amazing, beautiful, interesting and
                  inspirational experience to be both fully androgynous and have
                  no face.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  I&#8217;m androgynous myself in presentation and I get
                  gendered more-or-less randomly, but I have a
                  <em
                    >human face<\/em>, and this means I get treated differently
                    from if I don&#8217;t. <a
