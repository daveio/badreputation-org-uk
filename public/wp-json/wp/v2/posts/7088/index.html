        >Greenham Common<\/strong><\/a> was, by all accounts, something epic: a
        peaceful campaign of sustained, cooperative occupation by women against
        the bomb \u2013 and it
        <em
          >worked<\/em>. From 1981 to 2000 the camp, based around RAF Greenham
          Common military base in Berkshire, protested the presence of the
          (American) nuclear weapons held there \u2013 and eventually the
          weapons were removed.<\/p>\n

                Greenham Common had been an RAF base since 1941, and an American
                airbase since 1968. When the US moved 96 cruise missiles there
                in 1980, the protest began \u2013 forming properly in 1981. For
                years women, and their children too, lived in a makeshift camp
                in all weathers. Much like the <a
                href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/2011\/09\/07\/revolting-women-the-fight-for-the-missing-and-the-mothers-of-the-plaza-de-mayo\/\">Mothers
                of the Disappeared<\/a> protest in South America, Greenham
                Common used the concept of maternal authority to lend weight to
                their campaign. The women of Greenham Common were not protesting
                just for themselves, but for everyone \u2013 for their
                children\u2019s future, and for everyone else\u2019s. They
                hammered this home with slogans like \u2018when I grow up I want
                to be alive\u2019 \u2013 and children\u2019s clothes and
                children\u2019s art were often part of the decorations tied
                along the fences.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                Some children lived in the camp, too. I\u2019m afraid this is
                where my statistics gets a bit fuzzy because over 19 years, and
                through different seasons, it probably changed more than a
                bit.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>My mother reports the place was often a carnival: <\/p>\n</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p>
                  &#8230;there were the usual collections of street performers
                  and puppet shows to cheer us on&#8230; people on decorated
                  bikes, that kind of thing &#8230; there was a lot of weaving
                  things in the perimeter fence \u2013 rainbows, kid art,
                  &#8230; the whole perimeter fence was very gorgeous. There
                  were a lot of spiderwebs in the art. Spiderwebs were a big
                  theme &#8211; I suppose the theme of weaving something,
                  surrounding something.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n

                </p>
                <p>
                  The women who lived there endured arrests, freezing and muddy
                  conditions and the most rudimentary of provisions. Make no
                  mistake \u2013 these were badass women. Muddy women, tired
                  women, cold women, but strong, capable, mind-blowingly
                  determined women, and women who were not afraid to use bolt
                  cutters.<\/p>\n

                  argued, are not in anyone\u2019s interest, and should not be
                  anywhere. The protest was closely allied with CND, and it
                  garnered respect and support from people of all walks of life.
                  This <a
                  href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/news\/video\/2007\/dec\/12\/greenham\"><strong
                    >Guardian<\/strong> video<\/a> shows the mix and gives
                    slightly more of an idea of what the protests were like than
                    my second-generation verbal squeezing can do. <\/p>\n
                    <p>
                      Over the ten main years of the protest many people came
                      and went, but the backbone of it all were the base camps.
                      There were nine of these, each based around a different
                      set of gates to the base. Each base gained its own flavour
                      and focus, with the Violet Gate formed of religious
                      groups, the Blue Gate being much more new age, and the
                      Green Gate being entirely women-only as a rule. <\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Personally I\u2019m dubious about sticking a gender divide
                      in an otherwise very uniting protest \u2013 but there were
                      many places where men were welcome, too, and this simply
                      was, from the start, a women\u2019s movement. It was
                      founded and organised by women\u2019s groups (which in the
                      80s especially were fucking rad) \u2013 and women\u2019s
                      groups and unions around the country organised coaches to
                      and from the big demos. <\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The campaign gained huge amounts of media attention in
                      1983 when around 70,000 protestors <a
                      href=\"http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/player\/nol\/newsid_6540000\/newsid_6548500\/6548577.stm?bw=bb&#038;mp=rm&#038;news=1&#038;ms3=4&#038;ms_javascript=true&#038;bbcws=2\">formed
                      a human chain around the base<\/a>, stopping movement in
                      and out of it. (My mom was there!) With around 100 women
                      being arrested for breaking in. (My mom didn\u2019t do
                      that bit.) The scale and success of the Greenham Common
                      protest was widely credited with prompting similar actions
                      elsewhere in Britain and Europe. <\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The base camp protestors were evicted on numerous
                      occasions, but always returned before nightfall to set up
                      camp again. <\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      So \u2013 how did it all come to a close? In 1991 the
                      weapons were removed \u2013 but many protestors stayed a
                      further nine badass years until the final perimeter fences
                      were removed and the Common was returned back to public
                      land. Partly this was to make sure the land was returned,
                      but partly, it seems, because a real community had formed
                      and people were reluctant to leave it. <\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Above and beyond the call of duty \u2013 with rainbows and
                      mud and sisterhood. I think I\u2019m in love. <\/p>\n
