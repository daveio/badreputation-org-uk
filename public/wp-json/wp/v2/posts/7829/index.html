          Game: Mass Effect<\/h2>\n
          <p>
            About a hundred years behind the rest of the entire internet,
            I&#8217;m playing<strong>
              Mass Effect 2<\/strong>, and I&#8217;m enjoying it so, so much. I
              want to book a week off work just to complete it, and game all day
              long.<\/p>\n
              <p>
                You play Commander Shepard, who can be a man or woman, and
                it&#8217;s amazingly refreshing to be able to play a female war
                hero (either way, you&#8217;re pretty famous, after saving the
                galaxy in
                <strong
                  >Mass Effect 1<\/strong>). It&#8217;s great to be able to play
                  this female character who inspires so much respect in her
                  colleagues, military and civilian &#8211; everywhere she goes,
                  even big scary warlike aliens are afraid of her. My
                  Shepard&#8217;s a not-very-physically-intimidating blonde, so
                  it&#8217;s kind of fun.<\/p>\n
                  <p>
                    I love the team-building aspects of the game, too. You have
                    to persuade people to join you, and keep them happy and
                    loyal throughout the game. You can play as a good guy or a
                    bad guy, and some of the choices the game gives you (allow
                    genocide to continue for the good of the galaxy?) are
                    brilliant to play through. As writer and fellow Garrus
