  HEY READERS. I&#8217;m actually, due to some real life $stuff, staying with my
  family earlier than planned, meaning that some of the stuff I&#8217;d have
  photographed for this post I&#8217;ve not been able to, but here&#8217;s my

      The stocking was made by my mum in timeless 1980s acid brights. Some
      things basically NEVER go out of fashion, and let me tell you, a
      turquoise, pink, yellow and orange felt medley is one of those things.

            which was originally released in 1956 and went into the Grammy Hall
            of Fame in 2000. I love the image of her on the front. She looks
            like she&#8217;s taking precisely no crap from anybody. In a similar
            vein, to the left of that we&#8217;ve got <a

                  Christmas present to me this year. So beloved of the internet
                  has it become, it has an entry on <a

                  and I&#8217;m including it because throughout the entire text
                  of the book only one animal is gendered as &#8220;he&#8221;
                  and the rest are up to the reader to gender &#8211; if they
                  need gendering at all. After the <a

                  It&#8217;s hardly stridently feminist, but it&#8217;s very
                  good at not prescribing anything but a story. The second
