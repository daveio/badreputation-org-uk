  I first met Tara Chace in early 2001. When I met her, she was in Kosovo,
  looking down the scope of a sniper rifle at the head of a rogue Russian
  general. I watched her use that sniper rifle to liberally redistribute the
  man&#8217;s brains over the surrounding area, and then I watched her get shot
  as she escaped. With a bullet wound in her leg, I watched her get past a
  military checkpoint without arousing suspicion and then drive 62 kilometres
  before seeking medical attention.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>You might say that she got my attention.<\/p>\n</p>

  width=\"200\" height=\"95\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/>I&#8217;ve followed
  Tara&#8217;s exploits for almost ten years now, through the
  <strong
    >Queen and Country<\/strong> comics and novels, all written by Greg Rucka,
    so it was with my heart in my mouth that I opened the most recent novel
    <strong
      >Queen and Country: The Last Run<\/strong>, because if reading Queen and
      Country has taught me anything, it&#8217;s that absolutely no-one in it is
      safe. The novel opens with her realising that she&#8217;s getting a bit
      too old, and a step too slow, and tendering her resignation. And then,
      shortly thereafter, she is forced by political circumstance back into the
      field for the titular last run, a mission that she and her superiors know
      is almost certainly a trap. And this novel marks an end of sorts to Queen
      and Country, anything could happen, and indeed, everything does.<\/p>\n
      <p>
        Back in 2001, Tara Chace&#8217;s job title was Minder Two in the Special
        Section at the UK&#8217;s Special Intelligence Service (you&#8217;d know
        it as MI6) &#8211; the Special Section being composed of three
        &#8220;minders&#8221; &#8211; intelligence agents with the skills to be
        dispatched all over the world on highly dangerous short-term espionage
        assignments. She was, if you like, the female
        <strong
          >James Bond<\/strong>, except that to describe her as such is to sell
          her, and Queen and Country, short. Very short.<\/p>\n

            data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/>James Bond presents a macho fantasy
            &#8211; a ludicrous, over the top cartoon of a man, who contends
            with threats entirely absent from the real world &#8211;
            megalomaniacal super villains with absurd doomsday devices with
            which they hold entire countries to ransom. Queen and Country
            presents the reality: squalid deeds done in alleyways, a world where
            the greatest threat comes from bureaucrats in Whitehall who are only
            too willing to disavow Tara and her colleagues when things go bad.
            And they do go bad, all the time.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            The story described above would be the end of a Bond movie &#8211;
            the rogue general is defeated, and we watch Bond float off into the
            sunset. For a Queen and Country story, it&#8217;s only the beginning
            &#8211; the rest of the story sees MI6 attacked in their home in
            reprisal, and Tara being hunted on the streets of London, while her
            own government deny her adequate means to defend herself, and leave
            her &#8220;protected&#8221; by men whose goal is not to keep her
            alive, but to use her as bait. Because that&#8217;s the reality that
            James Bond doesn&#8217;t show.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            That&#8217;s the first Queen and Country story. The second one sees
            Tara back in the office, getting a psychological evaluation,
            because, after all, she has just killed a man in cold blood, then
            found herself more or less hung out to dry by the people who ordered
            her to do it, and there&#8217;s some concern that it might have
            affected her in some way. Of course it has, but not in a way that
            makes her unfit for duty, and she knows it.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            And there&#8217;s a duty she really wants to be part of &#8211; the
            other Minders are being sent on a mission in Afghanistan. In a comic
            written in early 2001. Tara, is of course, incensed about the
            treatment of women under the Taliban, and would like to do something
            to bloody their nose. But, of course, she can&#8217;t go. It&#8217;s
            much easier to put together a cover identity for a male agent that
            will let them get the job done.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            Just to make that as clear as I can for you: this is an espionage
            thriller with a female lead that was talking about the Taliban, and
            their treatment of women,
            <em
              >before<\/em> September the 11th 2001. Tell me that doesn&#8217;t
              pique your interest.<\/p>\n
              <p>
                (An amusing aside: Queen and Country may be the only comic
                where, when a new artist rendered Tara as a typical-for-comics
                pneumatic blonde in a revealing wardrobe, the readers wrote in
                to complain. Happily, her new endowments did not have any effect
                on Tara&#8217;s level of competence, or any treatment she
                received, and the next artist on the book returned her to her
                usual proportions.)<\/p>\n

                  It&#8217;s about the damaged personalities of the people who
                  engage in it, and the further damage the work piles on them.
                  It does not flinch away from depicting Tara, or her friends,
                  as damaged goods; it does not pretend that they are good
                  people fighting for an always-just cause. It understands that
                  the reality of their work is usually that they don&#8217;t get
                  to defeat the bad guy and head off into the sunset for sex
                  with an attractive young thing. When sex appears in these
                  books, it is as real as the rest of the work, and appears in a
                  number of different ways &#8211; a desperate seeking for a
                  little human warmth, an act of self-hatred, and here and
