          <p>
            She&#8217;s a great actress who I think does a lot for Women In
            Telly, so I was a bit disappointed with the way Dr Nikki Alexander
            (Fox\u2019s character) has been portrayed in this series of

                  <p>
                    I&#8217;ll get to Nikki, but I also wanted to mention that
                    I\u2019ve been a bit dismayed at the BBC\u2019s dumbing-down
                    of the series with woeful stereotypes akin to Channel
                    4\u2019s recent \u201cLet\u2019s just cause a hoohah to get
                    viewers\u201d strategy. Every episode of
                    <strong
                      >Silent Witness<\/strong> this series has pretty much
                      screamed \u2018The Police are incompetent and corrupt and
                      evil!\u2019. Topical? You could argue that, but the way
                      they\u2019ve tackled it has been very clumsy and
                      unsophisticated &#8211; not like the
                      <strong
                        >Silent Witness<\/strong> of previous years. Plus I
                        haven\u2019t heard of any police violently sexually
                        assaulting pimps in public toilets with long wooden

                          <p>
                            They\u2019ve also thrown in the old \u2018people who
                            play violent video games are all psychopathic
                            killers\u2019 trope &#8211; in the first episode no
                            less &#8211; which left me with a well defined
                            Unimpressed Face. Really, BBC? You want to play with
                            such

                                They certainly haven\u2019t done much for the
                                female figures in this series either, with three
                                suicides, all colleagues or friends of Leo, two
                                of which were women and neither of which were
                                portrayed very well. One also apparently found
                                the draw of Leo\u2019s soft gaze too hard to
                                resist and snogged his face off in a lab
                                despite, her being married and him in a

                                Nikki studied under this particular LadyPatho
                                and was quick to defend her, but the script made
                                both women look as if they\u2019d been stranded
                                in swathes of stereotypically female

                                purposefully railroaded by a patriarchal
                                pathologist hierarchy, whom she had dared to go

                                    undermined by the acting instructions Fox
                                    seems to have followed. By making an

                                        It is difficult for me to accept Emilia
                                        Fox&#8217;s performance as a betrayal of
                                        Nikki, but realistically I don\u2019t
                                        see how she could have agreed to play
                                        the scene that way without going against
                                        Nikki\u2019s intrinsic character. That
                                        is certainly disappointing. The
                                        series\u2019 new obsession with Lowest
                                        Common Denominator dross (probably

                                        disappointing. Though the stories have
                                        been, generally, interesting enough,
                                        Silent Witness still feels like
                                        it&#8217;s strayed from its path.<\/p>\n

                                        I hope that, for next year\u2019s
                                        series, the BBC drop this new Ch4-esque
                                        manifesto for just being offensive and
                                        shallow in order to viewer-grab away

                                        rubbish is on elsewhere. If needs be,
                                        just move it to BBC4 and make it a
                                        clever criminal show again &#8211;
                                        it&#8217;ll fit in nicely alongside
