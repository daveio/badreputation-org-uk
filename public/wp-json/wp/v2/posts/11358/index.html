  \u201cHi, nice to meet you. You&#8217;re looking great today, really confident
  and independent, good for you! A shame about the smell, though. I mean,
  really, everybody&#8217;s noticed it. And we all know it&#8217;s coming from,
  ahem,
  <em
    >down there<\/em>.<\/p>\n
    <p>
      \u201cOh no, no, it&#8217;s OK, don&#8217;t get offended, it&#8217;s not
      your fault. You can&#8217;t help it, I understand that. Your genitals are
      disgusting and they stink, especially when they&#8217;re bleeding and
      there&#8217;s nothing you can do about it. You didn&#8217;t ask to be born
      with such a terrible curse, and nobody expects you to take responsibility
      for it. Help is at hand, though! If you give me lots of money every month
      for forty years of your life, we can help! Because believe us, you need
      it&#8230;\u201d<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      I will admit up front that I am not a trained marketer, but it&#8217;s
      plain to see that the above isn&#8217;t the most convincing of sales
      pitches. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s a far more honest pitch than <a
      title=\"Always ActiPearls official page\"
      href=\"http:\/\/www.always-info.co.uk\/whats-new\/always-acti-pearls-pads.aspx\">the
      current campaign for Always sanitary towels<\/a>, which proudly declare
      the addition of \u201codour neutralising ActiPearls\u201d as the next step
      in the evolution of &#8220;feminine hygiene&#8221; products. What the ads
      coyly decline to mention is that they&#8217;ve taken lessons in odour
      neutralisation from the Lynx school of \u201csynthetic chemical stench and
      hygiene are THE SAME THING.\u201d<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      This is straight-up vagina-shaming. It&#8217;s insulting and inexcusable.
      And giving me yet another reason to be pissed off when I&#8217;m already
      simmering with ire about the massacre going on between my legs is
      inadvisable. So congratulations, P&amp;G: you&#8217;ve lost my custom for
      the next thirty years.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      The packaging claims to \u201cneutralise odours rather than just masking
      them\u201d. This is at best a delicate glossing over of the truth.
      It&#8217;s impossible to tell whether \u201codours\u201d (those vaginal
      FIENDS!) are neutralised or not because of the perfume.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>Oh God, the perfume.<\/p>\n</p>
    <p>
      I appreciate that scent perception can be a highly subjective thing, so
      I&#8217;ll attempt to keep the description as general as possible.
      Cloying, synthetic, sweet florals with an undertone of disinfectant, false
      and stereotypically feminine. It hits you as soon as you open the
      packaging, before even unwrapping the first towel. A scent that lingers
      for hours even if you switch to an unscented brand immediately after using
      one of these. A scent that does not mask menstrual blood, but mingles with
      it into a nauseating aberration.<\/p>\n

                  The problems presented by this are manifold, but there are
                  three main ones that leapt out at me. Bullet point list time?
                  Bullet point list time!<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <ul>
                  \n
                  <li>
                    The obvious implication that people who have vaginas are
                    utterly clueless about personal hygiene and how to take care
                    of themselves, plus the completely ignoring the fact that
                    vaginas are self cleansing and look after themselves without
                    much intervention from their owners beyond
                    showering\/bathing regularly. The idea that menstruation
                    makes a person malodorous or otherwise \u201cdirty\u201d is
                    an outdated and misogynistic notion. If a vagina IS smelling
                    bad, whether through illness or neglect, adding an
                    unpleasant artificial scent to the crotch is only going to
                    make the problem worse.<\/li>\n
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Following on from this, people who are at least vaguely
                    aware of their sexual health can tell from changes in
                    vaginal scent if something untoward or unusual is going on.
                    Trying to cover that up with perfumes isn&#8217;t going to
                    help anybody stay in touch with their genitalia.<\/li>\n
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The choice of such a blatantly &#8220;overt
                    femininity-pink-and-flowers-BECAUSE-THIS-PRODUCT-IS-FOR-GIRLLLSSS&#8221;
                    fragrance risks alienating trans* men and genderqueer
                    customers who choose to use these products. As if the
                    patronising \u201chave a happy period, always\u201d slogan
                    weren&#8217;t bad enough. Not only are Always trying to
                    insist that a reminder of nature not necessarily assigning
                    the genitalia that most closely match an individual&#8217;s
                    gender identity should be a matter for celebration, but also
                    that everybody should smell like a field full of artificial
                    blossoms when their loins are creating underpant carnage.
                    Way to consider the needs of your whole customer base,
                    there.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n
                    <p>
                      Now, at the risk of incurring violent flames, I&#8217;ll
                      admit that I am not the biggest fan of my vagina. I
                      appreciate the vast capacity for pleasure that it and its
                      associated physiological paraphernalia provide, but for
                      the most part our relationship is one of tacit
                      acknowledgement and grudging acceptance. This does not
                      mean, however, that I do not appreciate the inherent
                      beauty and wonder of such genitalia.<\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      A vagina should smell like a vagina. A vagina should not
                      smell of roses or perfumes or <a
                      href=\"http:\/\/londonfeminist.com\/site\/femfresh-fail\/\">any
                      number of artificial masking agents<\/a>. Every healthy
                      vagina has a personality and life all of its own and scent
                      to match.<\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      At a time where in the USA, the wealthy, middle-aged,
                      cis-male elitists running the country seem determined to
                      drive women&#8217;s bodily autonomy and sexual rights back
                      into the Victorian era, now seems a very prudent time to
                      turn our eyes to our genitals and send a clear message to
                      politicians and megabucks sanitary product manufacturers
                      alike that our bodies belong to nobody but ourselves.
                      Their efforts to undermine and deny our sexuality will be
                      met with the resistance and fight it deserves, until they
                      back the hell off what&#8217;s between our legs.<\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      If we really must accept defeat and acknowledge that we
                      are no longer capable of keeping our own vaginas
                      spring-fresh, then our next step is clear: begin a
                      campaign to <a title=\"Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab
                      Perfumes\"
                      href=\"http:\/\/www.blackphoenixalchemylab.com\/\">Black
                      Phoenix Alchemy Lab<\/a> to produce their own range of
                      sanitary towels impregnated with their gorgeous scents.
                      Because if my vagina isn&#8217;t allowed to smell like a
                      vagina any more, it can do a hell of a lot better than
                      Procter and Gamble&#8217;s sickly synthetic flower
                      bleach.<\/p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy
