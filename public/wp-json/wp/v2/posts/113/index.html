          this site. But most of all, this film beautifully nails the sheer
          level of confusion that surrounds how female pop musicians should
          present themselves, especially mired as we are in this business

                                        to get there.\u00a0 And Fowley has his

                                        later declaring that actually,

                                          As the film gathers speed, it focuses
                                          not on the fever pitch of rock
                                          &#8216;n&#8217; roll excess &#8211;

                                          tension between the girls as they
                                          struggle to manage the problem of
                                          sexing it up for the lads versus rock

                                          Runaways-alumni, but it&#8217;s a film
                                          that&#8217;s full of visual dualities

                                          but she needs Currie on board. They
                                          need each other. Currie is pilloried
                                          by her bandmates for taking on
