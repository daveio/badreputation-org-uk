        Synopsis<\/h3>\n
        <p>
          When her father dies, thoughtful, solitary Laura moves from their home
          in the country to the house of her brother and his family where she
          spends decades in a pleasant but stultifying routine of needlework,
          small talk and dull family holidays. Laura settles into being
          \u201cuseful and obliging\u201d Aunt Lolly, but can never escape the
          feeling that there is something missing from her existence.<\/p>\n

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            While her body sat before the first fires and was cosy with Henry
            and Caroline, her mind walked by lonely seaboards, in marshes and
            fens, or came at nightfall to the edge of a wood. She never imagined
            herself in these places by daylight. She never thought of them as
            being in any way beautiful. It was not beauty at all that she
            wanted&#8230; Her mind was groping after something that eluded her
            experience, a something that was shadowy and menacing, and yet in
            some way congenial.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<div id=\"attachment_11414\"

          <p>
            One day, aged 47, the insistent voice within overwhelms her. She
            claims her rightful income from her brother and moves to a village
            in the Chilterns where she revels in her newfound independence,
            solitude and connection with nature. When her freedom is threatened
            by the arrival in the village of her dear but demanding nephew Titus
            she does what any of us would do: makes a pact with Satan to send
            him on his way.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <h3>
            A problem as common as blackberries<\/h3>\n
            <p>
              There is a feminist thread that runs brightly through this gentle,
              surprising and occasionally sinister story. Just have a look at
              the Austen-worthy comment early on, describing Laura as a young
              woman:<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                Being without coquetry she did not feel herself bound to feign a
                degree of entertainment which she had not experienced, and the
                same deficiency made her insensible to the duty of every
                marriageable young woman to be charming, whether her charm be
                directed towards one special object or, in default of that,
                universally distributed through a disinterested love of
                humanity.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                But I suspect Laura\u2019s plight will strike a chord with
                anyone who prefers their own company. All she wants is to be
                left alone. She is forced to take radical steps (going against
                her family\u2019s wishes, negotiating with her brother for the
                return of the money she is owed, moving to a place she has never
                been, living alone and, um, becoming a witch) simply so that she
                can be left to her own devices. And she sees that countless
                other women are locked into the same comfortable cage:<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <p>
                  I seem to see all over England, all over Europe, women living
                  and growing old, as common as blackberries, and as unregarded.
                  If they could be passive and unnoticed, it wouldn&#8217;t
                  matter. But they must be active, and still not noticed.
                  Doing,\u00a0 doing, doing, till mere habit scolds at them like
                  a housewife, and rouses them up &#8211; when they might sit in
                  their doorways and think &#8211; to be doing
                  still!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although the description of Laura\u2019s first witches\u2019
                  sabbath and her conversations with Satan are delightful and
                  strikingly original even now, the novel isn\u2019t about
                  witchcraft. A far greater proportion of the book is devoted to
                  Laura\u2019s childhood and time with her brother\u2019s family
                  in London than to her time in the village of Great Mop.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <h3>
                  Where else to turn?<\/h3>\n
                  <p>
                    Her entry into the service of the dark lord is presented as
                    the only escape for a soul which has for so long been
                    cornered and boxed in by convention. It is the inevitable
                    conclusion of the binding restrictions placed on
                    women\u2019s self-determination by the demands of propriety
                    and duty, most of all to be meek and helpful and always
                    anchored to a man, whether a father, brother or husband.
                    Laura recognises the structures which have created and
                    perpetuated her captivity:<\/p>\n
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>
                      As for her own share in the matter, she felt no shame at
                      all. It had pleased Satan to come to her aid. Considering
                      carefully she could not see who else would have done so.
                      Custom, public opinion, law, church and state \u2013 all
                      would have shaken their massive heads against her plea and
                      sent her back to bondage.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The simultaneous sharp departure from the usual of Laura
                      and her narrative gives the end of the novel a quietly
                      bold and subversive mood. And while there\u2019s not a lot
                      of actual witchiness there is plenty of subtly uncanny
                      imagery. For example, on a whim Laura bakes some scones in
                      the shapes of her neighbours, and watches as her guest
                      eats \u201cthe strange shapes without comment, quietly
                      splitting open the villagers and buttering
                      them\u201d.<\/p>\n
