  There are a few things that I&#8217;ve decided are never going out of fashion:
  pirates and zombies. \u00a0They&#8217;re ubiquitous.\u00a0 They&#8217;re
  <em
    >everywhere<\/em>.\u00a0 Everyone&#8217;s party either wants you to come as
    one or other or a mixture of the two, or wouldn&#8217;t mind if you
    did.\u00a0 This is no bad thing: zombies are obviously a reclamation of the
    middle-class stigmatisation of the working class as a shambling, faceless,
    flesh-eating horde, and pirates are &#8230;pirates.\u00a0 Who wouldn&#8217;t

      the beards and the array of innovative tropical sexually-acquired

                              showing the title of the film. The poster design
                              is a sort of cone of people, with the Pirate
                              Captain (a pale-skinned man with a large brown
                              beard) central. To the left of him, there is a
                              dark-skinned, cunning-looking female pirate with
                              dark hair and a large cutlass. To his right, also
                              holding his arm, is a pale-skinned femme pirate
                              dressed in pastel colours with a large, ginger
                              beard. Beneath them, there are assorted other
                              characters, such as Queen VIctoria, looking
                              vicious and making an &quot;Off with his
                              head&quot; gesture with her hands, and a pirate
                              that looks rather like Elvis, only a pirate. There
                              is also a mermaid, a galleon, a monkey in a suit,
                              a heap of gold and two cannons. Assorted pirates
                              and Charles Darwin populate the frame of the
                              image, dangling off airships. Copyright Aardman,

                                            The humour of her character is
