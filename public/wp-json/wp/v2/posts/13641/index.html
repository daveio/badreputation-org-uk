            I live in Cambridge, which is a nice place, and contains the
            Fitzwilliam Museum, which is also nice.\u00a0 Startlingly nice, in
            fact.\u00a0 Long warrens of gold-framed paintings, glass cabinets
            full of glittering treasures, and ancient wooden tables polished to
            a mirror sheen with little toblerone notices on them telling you to
            keep your paws off, thank you.<\/ul>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            There&#8217;s marble busts that I could look at for years and never
            get old, myriad hoards of coins, terrible thorny ranks of daggers
            and swords, medieval Christian bling and a glorious rotating
            selection of temporary exhibitions.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            Their temporary exhibitions are spectacular.\u00a0 They recently had
            one on Chinese tomb treasures that I saw posters for when I was
            visiting London.\u00a0 &#8220;I&#8217;ve been to that!&#8221; I
            exclaimed, pointing at a poster on the Tube.\u00a0 But no-one was
            impressed, for they were cultured London types with the British
            Museum on their doorstep, and I am a scruffy Cambridge yokel with
            orange hair and visible underpants.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            The most recent standout exhibit &#8211; which was so busy they had
            to implement a timed ticket system &#8211; was the <a

                You all know who
                <strong
                  >Quentin Blake<\/strong> is, of course.\u00a0 He illustrated
                  all of
                  <strong
                    >Roald Dahl&#8217;s<\/strong> books for children and many
                    other things besides.\u00a0 I wasn&#8217;t very familiar
                    with his &#8220;many other things besides&#8221;, though,
                    and that was what this exhibit showed me.<\/p>\n
                    <p>
                      I didn&#8217;t know, for example, that he has done public
                      paintings for hospitals.\u00a0 There were many of his
                      maternity-unit paintings, all involving cheerful mothers
                      having fun in a variety of scenes (some are <a
                      href=\"http:\/\/quentinblake.com\/gallery\/hospitals\/item\/344-2011sallesdebain1-100x100cm\"

                      unit<\/a>) and all very sweet and soothing to look
                      at.<\/p>\n

                    <p>
                      And there was this one that made me lose my shit
                      comprehensively.<\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I was already on delicate emotional footing because I have
                      a lot of feelings about Quentin Blake, and then I came
                      across this painting he&#8217;d done for the Vincent
                      Square eating disorder treatment unit in London.<\/p>\n

                    <p>
                      The painting, titled

                        a gown<\/a>, feeding birds on her windowsill through the
                        open sash window.\u00a0 She looks happy, and all the
                        birds are eating seeds.<\/p>\n
                        <p>
                          This just in: I have just started crying writing that

                          She&#8217;s in her room, where she has to stay until
                          she&#8217;s better, but the birds can go where they
                          please; she is happy to feed the birds, and the birds
                          are happy to be fed.\u00a0 Oh my god, there are so
                          many things in that piece that kind of punched me in
                          the heart until I burst into a fire hydrant of noisy
                          tears in the middle of the reflective silence of the
                          exhibit.<\/p>\n
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Some very well-behaved children turned around and
                          scowled at me.\u00a0 My partner ushered me on.\u00a0

                            she&#8217;d done.\u00a0 The tears came again, only

                              And then, at the end, there was an illustration

                                    Blake&#8217;s paintings, with their

                                    &#8211; fluid washes of watercolour and ink
                                    contained by haphazard spidery cages of

                                    more life-accurate than anything

                                    capture and reflect simple happiness and

                                    I don&#8217;t want to use words like
                                    &#8220;innocence&#8221;, because I
                                    don&#8217;t like its implications of
                                    fetishising a lack of knowledge.\u00a0
                                    Blake&#8217;s paintings are very canny;
                                    their veneer of simplicity disguising a
                                    great depth of self-awareness and knowledge
                                    of the subject.<\/p>\n

                                    wolf.\u00a0 The big wolf likes her painting,
                                    and looms in front of her with giant,
                                    masonry-nail fangs bared in an appreciative
                                    grin.\u00a0 She has nothing to fear from her
                                    playmate, however, because she is brave and
                                    has made friends with something that others
                                    would find terrifying and avoid.<\/p>\n

                                    finding joy in feeding the birds.\u00a0 The
                                    birds don&#8217;t know why she&#8217;s in
                                    hospital, or of her own difficulties with
                                    food; they just like seeds and she&#8217;s
                                    put some out for them.<\/p>\n
