  I was reading <a href=\"http:\/\/lancashire.greatbritishlife.co.uk\/\"><strong
    >Lancashire Life<\/strong><\/a> whilst back home at my parents&#8217; (stop
    judging me, it&#8217;s the rural North and the Internet doesn&#8217;t work
    properly) when I came across an article about Joanne Moore. Not the <a
    href=\"http:\/\/www.glamourgirlsofthesilverscreen.com\/show.php?id=197\">glamour
    girl of the silver screen<\/a> otherwise known as Dorothy Cook (no

    for G&amp;J Greenalls<\/a>, and she&#8217;s the world&#8217;s only master
    gin distiller.<\/p>\n
    <p>
      It&#8217;s an interesting article, and well worth a read, but
      there&#8217;s more to this than wheeling out the tired old saw of
      &#8220;Wow! A woman doing a man&#8217;s job!&#8221;. However, I do want to
      offer some heartfelt congratulations to Joanne especially for her

        Gin arrived on our shores in around 1690. By the eighteenth century it
        had become very popular, culminating in <a
        href=\"http:\/\/culturalshifts.com\/archives\/168\">The Gin Craze<\/a>.
        Put simply, <a
        href=\"http:\/\/www.historic-uk.com\/CultureUK\/MothersRuin.htm\">gin
        was cheap, strong and easily available, particularly for the urban
        poor<\/a>. A lot of gin was drunk, and a lot of poor people
        <em
          >got<\/em> drunk. As is often the case when poor people take drugs,
          gin was linked to crime, and in the case of poor women, it was linked
          to promiscuous behaviour and infertility, earning the sobriquet
          <em

              Reformers of the time, including <a
              href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Beer_Street_and_Gin_Lane\">William
              Hogarth<\/a>, focussed on how gin consumption might be affecting
              women. This sort of thing is still the case today &#8211; with
              excitable press articles over binge-drinking &#8220;<a

              the idea of a drunken woman is treated very differently from that
              of a drunken man. Given that women were supposedly exemplars of
              correct social behaviour, their bad gin drinking behaviour was
              treated with something akin to political hysteria, and <a

                known as the <a

                Act<\/a> and for a while, at least, gin did not touch the lips

                          class=\"wp-caption-text\">With the invention of the
                          cocktail - and the cocktail dress - gin became a
                          premium product for women<\/p><\/div>\n
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Gin martinis were invented at some point in the
                          mid-19th century, and they oozed class and sex appeal.
                          Gone was the downtrodden image of gin, and here to
                          stay was the limey note (although the martini is an
                          american invention, gin remains very, very British) of
                          superiority in cocktail form. My favourite anecdote is
                          over\u00a0 <a title=\"Noel Coward\"
                          href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Noel_Coward\">Noel
                          Coward<\/a>&#8216;s recipe for the martini:
                          &#8220;filling a glass with gin then waving it in the
                          general direction of Italy&#8221;.<\/p>\n
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          With sexy gin came sexy ladies, of course. In popular
                          culture, the gin-drinking lady had shaken off her
                          working class shackles and exchanged them for high
                          heels and a form-fitting cocktail dress. Yet the
                          phantom of criminality still lingered, especially in
                          the States, where during Prohibition cheap, illegal
                          gin was widely available due to the relative ease of
                          making the spirit, giving rise to <a
                          href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bathtub_gin\">bathtub
                          gin<\/a>, so called because you could make it in your

                        </p>
                        <p>
                          And as we know from Hogarth, criminality + gin + women
                          = political difficulties over female sexuality. This
                          time, there are tales to be told with women on both
                          sides of the bar.<\/p>\n
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The case for Prohibition was being made by the
                          Christian campaigning group known as the <a
                          href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Woman%27s_Christian_Temperance_Union\">Women&#8217;s
                          Temperance Movement<\/a>. On the other side of the
                          fence, we have gin-drinking flappers adorning the
                          aisles in <a
                          href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Speakeasy\">Speakeasies<\/a>.
                          These women were both working towards different kinds
                          of freedoms, which perhaps have reached their pinnacle
                          in the sex-positive and anti-porn camps of
                          today&#8217;s feminist movement.<\/p>\n
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The anti-gin temperance faction were looking for a way
                          of getting their household money out of the hands of
                          the barkeepers and into their cupboards to feed their
                          children (this from a time when men were the primary
                          breadwinners and their wives were given an allocation
                          of salary to spend on the home and family). The
                          glittery girls in their cocktail dresses were living a
                          lifestyle outside of traditional notions of
                          &#8220;home and hearth&#8221;.<\/p>\n

                                There&#8217;s lots of different sorts of brands,
                                with their own mix of botanicals. There are gin
                                clubs, and many of the beautiful London pubs are
                                reclaiming their heritage as <a

                                palaces<\/a>. These buildings, with their wood
                                panel divisions and separate entrance ways,
                                marked a time when it was unseemly for a lady to
                                be in a public house, and the ability to drink
                                with discretion, and away from the riff-raff,
                                was valued.<\/p>\n

                                  The most dangerous drink is gin. You have to
                                  be really, really careful with that. And you
                                  also have to be 45, female and sitting on the
                                  stairs. Because gin isn&#8217;t really a
                                  drink, it&#8217;s more a mascara thinner.
