<p>
  A <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/2011\/05\/17\/what-the-hell-advertising\/\">while
  back<\/a> we took a look at some recent adverts and discovered that, in a
  surprising turn of results, they were a bit crap when it came to portrayals of
  gender. And when I say a bit crap I mean it appeared that the advertising
  executives responsible had just recently stepped out of a portal from 1953 and
  brought their value system with them.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  Today we revisit that topic because there are so very many adverts out there
  and we need a reminder that this is a field in need of a change. Advertising
  plays a large part in shaping our views of the world, so when it&#8217;s
  portraying something that&#8217;s almost casually wrongheaded, that&#8217;s a
  problem. <\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  Now, confession: I watch a lot of American football. And this apparently makes
  me the target demographic for adverts pushing light beer, pickup trucks
  (September is truck month! Truck Month! TRUCK MONTH! Also so are <a
  href=\"http:\/\/scottrocketship.com\/post\/451775849\/the-automotive-industrys-marketing-gets-a-little\">all
  the other months<\/a>) and soft drinks. Every ad break is packed full of
  these, and if there&#8217;s one thing American football does not lack for, it
  is ad breaks. What I&#8217;m saying here is that I&#8217;ve seen a lot of
  these adverts, and they are seventeen different shades of bad. The truck ads
  are surprisingly free of the sort of overblown machismo you might expect from
  the automotive industry, but the beer and soft drinks? Oh, my. So let us take
  a look at three terrible beverage adverts.<\/p>\n
</p>
<h3>
  1: Dr Pepper Ten<\/h3>\n
  <p>
    <iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\"

  </p>
  <p>
    The advertising industry is known for its orginality. No wait, the other
    thing. Lack of creativity and original thinking, that&#8217;s what I meant
    to say. So it is perhaps not surprising that Dr Pepper have lifted the
    entire idea for this ad campaign directly from the old <a
    href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=QcjlzSod0CE\">&#8220;Not for
    girls&#8221;<\/a> thing Yorkie did.<\/p>\n
  </p>
  <p>
    Dr Pepper Ten, like <a
    href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=S-Xv3m4I4co&#038;feature=related\">Coke
    Zero<\/a> before it, is a diet drink for men. Men don&#8217;t go on diets,
    you see, so you can&#8217;t put the word &#8220;diet&#8221; in the name of
    the drink. Calories are manly; watching what you consume is not. That, Dr
    Pepper assures us, is for the ladies. This message is forced through our
    eyeballs and directly into our brains via the medium of explosions and
    toughness, because if there is anything that women hate, it&#8217;s
    explosions. That&#8217;s a science fact.<\/p>\n
  </p>
  <p>
    And okay, you can say &#8220;But Dr Pepper are clearly being ironic!
    It&#8217;s a sly and hip jab at sexist values! Get a sense of humour!&#8221;
    Except no, the problem with ironically supporting terrible gender values is
    that you&#8217;re still supporting terrible gender values, and those are
    still an active problem that negatively impact the lives of countless
    people. It would be nice to be in a place where we can look back and go
    &#8220;Ha ha, those outdated ideas, how quaint and comical they seem now
    from our position of enlightenment.&#8221; But we&#8217;re not in that place
    yet &#8211; we still live in a world where these values are things people
    actually believe. Read the YouTube comments if you want to see why this is
    still a problem. Except don&#8217;t, because much like reading the creepy
    eldritch book in a Lovecraft story, reading Youtube comments can lead only
    to infinite screaming madness as your brain confronts unknowable
    horrors.<\/p>\n
  </p>
  <p>
    Of course, the real reason no one drinks Diet Dr Pepper is not because diet
    drinks are somehow effeminate, it&#8217;s because Diet Dr Pepper tastes like
    licking the underside of a pub table.<\/p>\n
  </p>
  <h3>
    2. Miller Lite<\/h3>\n
    <p>
      <iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\"
      src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/70aAcGGBJ2Q\" frameborder=\"0\"
      allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Drinking the wrong light beer makes you less of a man. This is another
      science fact. We&#8217;re learning a lot today. Thank you advertising!
      This is one of many recent Miller ads that makes a link between choice of
      beer and ability to conform to established gender roles. They also have an
      &#8220;unmanly choice&#8221; range in which men are judged by their peers
      for making unmanly choices such as riding on a scooter or drinking the
      wrong brand of light beer. <\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      See, here&#8217;s the thing: all alcoholic drinks are basically a chemical
      to make your brain go temporarily wonky plus some other stuff to hide the
      taste of this brain-wonking substance. That is all drinks, forever. So why
      is one flavour man-tastic and another not? It is a mystery. Someone fetch
      me a fruity colourful cocktail so I can make this point properly about how
      thoroughly ridiculous it is to gender one&#8217;s choice of
      alcohol.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      For an added bonus, Miller throw in some token sexy female lifeguards
      (because maybe if you drink Miller Lite, you too will receive attention
      from professional models. That is how things work, right?) and some bonus
      &#8220;comedy&#8221; fear of people who are insufficiently attractive to
      meet beer advert norms. Careful, if you drink the wrong beer someone you
      don&#8217;t find appealing may try to force CPR on you. This is a thing
      that happens. Honest.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <h3>
      3. Fosters<\/h3>\n
      <p>
        <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\"
        src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/yhm3sIZiaz4\" frameborder=\"0\"
        allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        To round out the trio of beverage related horrors, we have Fosters
        serving up a healthy heap of happy homophobia. Guys, don&#8217;t touch
        other guys! That&#8217;s how you get the gay. This is our third and
        final science fact of the day. Do you want to become gay? Of course not!
        That would be a massive social failing on your part. So drink Fosters,
        to ensure you receive your suggested daily dose of
        heterosexuality.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        These are not values it is okay to espouse. This is not some
        lighthearted humour at a topic too ridiculous to be taken seriously, it
        is a marketing tool that helps establish harmful cultural norms.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        For an added treat, it&#8217;s not just issues of gender and homophobia
        on which the advertising industry fails us here. Look back over those
        three adverts and tell me what you don&#8217;t see. Here&#8217;s a
        helpful hint: the answer is anyone who isn&#8217;t white. People from
        non-white backgrounds make up over one quarter of America&#8217;s
        population, but apparently 0% of its beverage-purchasing
        demographic.<\/p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div
