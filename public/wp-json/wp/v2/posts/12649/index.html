Feminism: HANDS OFF! Women&#8217;s Self-defence, 1942
style"},"content":{"rendered":"
<p>
  It&#8217;s not automatically feminist for self-defence books to point out that
  women can be in physical danger from men. I wrote <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/2011\/09\/12\/revolting-women-the-ju-jutsuffragettes\/\">a
  previous post for BadRep<\/a> on suffragette Edith Garrud, who produced a
  leaflet describing a woman being attacked as she walked home at night, as well
  as a short play in which a wife defends herself against her drunken husband.
  In both those writings, she showed the woman in a routine or domestic
  situation defending herself using the ju-jutsu that Edith was teaching (in
  1910!).<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  Well, it&#8217;s maybe not surprising that Mrs Garrud&#8217;s guides were
  written from a feminist standpoint, but I wasn&#8217;t expecting quite the
  same level of realism from the very military <a
  href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/William_E._Fairbairn\">William E.
  Fairbairn<\/a> in a book I stumbled across this week.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  A policeman and soldier, Fairbairn knew a LOT about combat. I mean, really.
  No, REALLY. As the ever-excitable website <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.badassoftheweek.com\/fairbairn.html\"
  target=\"_blank\"><strong
    >Badass of the Week<\/strong><\/a> put it:<\/p>\n
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Fairbairn was stationed in Japanese-occupied Korea from 1903 to 1907,
        and he spent the majority of those four years learning everything he
        possibly could about the long-lost art of epically kicking the fiery
        rainbow-living sh**fire out of every living thing on the planet until
        the only things left inhabiting Earth are multi-colored protoplasmic
        bags of liquefied organs and bone shards.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        What made him unique was that he didn&#8217;t mind fighting very, very
        dirty if it meant you won. And so he did win, usually against street
        gangs and organised crime rings in Shanghai, where he served with the
        police. And he then taught that to the commandos, and special forces,
        the pre-CIA, he invented the SWAT team and tactics still being used
        today, had a black belt in judo certified by
        <em
          >the guy who invented judo<\/em>, and allegedly held a six-week
          training course in &#8216;silent killing&#8217; which included using
          only a normal stick. He is an enormous figure in Western close-combat
          history.<\/p>\n
          <p>
            In 1942, Fairbairn wrote a book which was marketed in the US as <a
            href=\"http:\/\/www.scribd.com\/doc\/57957350\/HANDS-OFF-Self-Defense-for-Women-Major-W-E-Fairbairn-1942\"
            target=\"_blank\"><strong
              >HANDS OFF! Self Defense for Women<\/strong><\/a>. Where the
              feminist interest comes in isn&#8217;t that he wrote it at all, or
              that it contains full-strength combat moves while being aimed
              solely at women, but that he included paragraphs like this:<\/p>\n
              <blockquote>
                <p>
                  It frequently happens that you meet a person who is very proud
                  of his gripping powers and takes great pleasure, when shaking
                  hands, in gripping your hand with all his strength, apparently
                  with the idea of convincing you that he is a real
                  &#8220;he-man&#8221;.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is a very simple matter for you to take the conceit out of
                  him &#8211; place the point of your right thumb on the back of
                  his hand between the thumb and index finger, as in Fig.

                  The thing which struck me about the whole book is his
                  attitude, which coincides completely with Edith Garrud&#8217;s
                  where she wrote &#8220;Woman is exposed to many perils
                  nowadays, because so many who call themselves \u2018men\u2019
                  are not worthy of that exalted title.&#8221;<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  Fairbairn assumes that the male attacker in his examples
                  &#8211; who grabs, threatens or harasses a woman &#8211;
                  deserves no mercy from the
                  <em
                    >terrifying<\/em> array of STONE-COLD KICKASS which she is
                    then encouraged to perform in return. And he does so not
                    with a tone of patriarchal protectiveness, but of dismissive
                    contempt for the man and righteous calm practical advice for
                    the woman.<\/p>\n
                    <p>
                      In some places, he qualifies his including the more
                      extreme moves with a &#8216;should you need to&#8217;, but
                      it always seems to be cushioning language for civilians
                      frightened at the thought of personal combat, not at all
                      because the reader is a woman. In his introduction, the
                      only differences he cites for women are in typical
                      averages of height and muscle strength, never some
                      imagined intrinsic weakness of will or emotions. That
                      stuff was rampant in 1942, and not including a word of it
                      is impressive.<sup

                          What&#8217;s also nice to see is that he classes any
                          unwanted touching &#8211; such as a man stroking a
                          woman&#8217;s knee when sitting next to her at the
                          theatre or cinema &#8211; as serious enough to warrant
                          a physical response. Damn right. Also, ouch. (He calls

                                nice to find a manual with no condescension, a
                                frank regard for the dangers women face, and the
                                emphasis placed on a woman&#8217;s right to her
