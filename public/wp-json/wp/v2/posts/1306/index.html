    &#8220;I should say that a walking suit in which one could not walk, and a
    winter suit which exposes the throat, head, and feet to cold and damp, was
    rather a failure,&#8221; said Dr. Alec [who had his own ideas about what his
    niece should be wearing.]<\/p>\n
  </p>
  <p>
    &#8220;Alec, if it is a Bloomer, I shall protest. I&#8217;ve been expecting
    it, but I know I cannot bear to see that pretty child sacrificed to your
    wild ideas of health. Tell me it isn&#8217;t a Bloomer!&#8221; and Mrs.
    Clara clasped her hands imploringly.<\/p>\n

        The word&#8217;s first appearance is in capitalised form:\u00a0<em
          >Knickerbocker<\/em> is the name given to &#8216;a descendent of the
          original Dutch settlers of the New Netherlands in America; hence, a
          New Yorker&#8217; \u2013 the New &#8216;Netherlands&#8217; becoming,
          of course, New &#8216;York&#8217; after the English got their grubby
          hands on it.<\/p>\n
          <p>
            The everyday appearance of the term\u00a0must be attributed
            to\u00a0Washington Irving&#8217;s 1848
            <em
              >History of New York<\/em>, purported to have been written by one
              &#8216;Diedrich Knickerbocker&#8217;. A long chain, this name was
              appropriated from Irving&#8217;s pal Herman of the same name, who
              was in turn descended from Harmen Jansen Knickerbocker
              (c.1650-1720), one of the original Dutch settlers, who supposedly
              invented the name. Awesome.<\/p>\n
              <p>But where are the unmentionables?<\/p>\n</p>
              <h3>
                It&#8217;s Over.<\/h3>\n
                <p>
                  <span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-size: 13px;\">These
                  appear in the second sense of the word, a development on the
                  first, from 1859, where it is pluralised to
                  <em
                    >knickerbockers <\/em>&#8211; &#8216;Loose-fitting breeches,
                    gathered in at the knee; also extended to the whole costume
                    worn with this&#8217;. Irving is once again lurking around,
                    because this usage is said to refer to George
                    Cruikshank&#8217;s illustrations of the same opus.
                    Knickerbockers wear knickerbockers. Duh.<\/span><\/p>\n
                    <p>
                      These &#8216;loose-fitting breeches gathered at the
                      knee&#8217; became, in another life, standard wear for
                      little boys, whose

                        >breeching <\/em>(the graduation to trousers)
                        consequently became a coming-of-age moment. Short
                        trousers, of course,\u00a0facilitated\u00a0easy,

                          her little niece, Rose, wearing such loose-fitting
                          bifurcated garments: &#8216;Dress her in that boyish
                          way and she will act like a boy. I do hate all these

                              differentiation. Little girls wear restrictive
                              petticoats to keep them ladylike; those boys who

                                      1850s,\u00a0Miss Amelia Bloomer, from
                                      Cortland County, New York, began a crusade
                                      to popularise the &#8216;Bloomer
                                      suit&#8217;, not her own invention, but
                                      eventually synonymous with her name. This
                                      was an Eastern-inspired way to wear your
                                      skirt: shorter with the aid of modest,
                                      wide-legged trousers that tapered at the
                                      knee. Modesty preserved; movement
                                      uninhibited. Job done.<\/p>\n

                                        success was limited and

                                          project altogether because of the
                                          arrival of a fresh sartorial
