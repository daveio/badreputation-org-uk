    I&#8217;ve turned over different ways to start this review in my head, and
    really the best way I can think of is with an apology. I&#8217;m sorry. I
    did a bad thing. I watched the American remake of
    <strong
      >The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo<\/strong> before I saw the original
      Swedish. I haven&#8217;t even read the books, either. When
      <em
        >my own<\/em> revolution comes, I&#8217;ll be first against the wall.
        And then my revolution will end.<\/p>\n

          I am often ferociously anti-Americanised-remakes, as the remake trend
          can assume, on the part of their Western, English-speaking audience, a
          certain level of
          can&#8217;t-be-bothered-with-anything-not-in-their-own-language.<sup

            okay. It&rsquo;s a natural reaction. \">1<\/a><\/sup> It also
            assumes that anything not English-language isn&#8217;t really worth

                me tell you why. It&#8217;s quite simple, really.<\/p>\n
                <p>
                  Rape scenes. That&#8217;s why. There&#8217;s some notoriously
                  graphic sexual assault in these films. So I avoided them. I
                  avoided them very well until I heard

                        three days ago, I found myself with a spare few hours
                        and a fiver in my pocket, and went, &#8220;Hey,
                        I&#8217;ll go and see a film that I know will trigger
                        the fuck out of me on my own! What could go wrong with
                        that?&#8221;<\/p>\n
                        <p>
                          Nothing went wrong at all. I mean, yes, both rape
                          scenes are absolutely atrocious and I actually felt
                          sick and cried, and if you&#8217;re at all disturbed
                          by the portrayal of sexual assault, stay the

                            >fuck<\/em> clear of this film, BUT I saw it again
                            the next day and bought all three of the original
                            Swedish films (well, the extended versions that were
                            two-parters for televised release), and watched the
                            original

                              >TGWTDT<\/strong> that very evening. I was going
                              to, in fact, write a comparison piece on the films
                              and talk about how the remake does things
                              differently in terms of the plot and all that, but
                              something magic happened when I went to see the
                              film the first time around and I found myself
                              incapable of doing so.<\/p>\n

                                Have you ever fallen in love with a fictional
                                character? Everyone says it&#8217;s impossible
                                to fall in love at first sight, and while that
                                may be true of people you meet in the street,
                                it&#8217;s totally possible to fall in love with
                                a character the moment they appear in the
                                story.<\/p>\n

                                I have fallen in love with Lisbeth Salander. So,
                                this review is going to compare the original
                                Lisbeth (played by the divine
                                <strong
                                  >Noomi Rapace<\/strong>) and the remake
                                  Lisbeth (an unrecognisable
                                  <strong
                                    >Rooney Mara<\/strong>), and how her
                                    character varies across the films, in part
                                    because of some very small design decisions.
                                    It&#8217;s also a good excuse for me to do
                                    some proper fanart of her. I fully accept
                                    that my opinion of Lisbeth was shaped by the
                                    version of her I saw first.<\/p>\n
                                    <p>
                                      In
                                      <strong
                                        >Niels Arden Oplev&#8217;s<\/strong>
                                        original films, Noomi Rapace&#8217;s
                                        Lisbeth is withdrawn and quite brusque,
                                        but perceptive and vengeful. She makes
                                        eye contact with people, she touches
                                        them, asks questions &#8211; she&#8217;s
                                        pretty easy to relate to, and in the
                                        however-many hours of sprawling
                                        investigative plot you get, she
                                        undergoes a lot of development, morphing
                                        beautifully from a quietly damaged,
                                        pained creature to this fully-fledged
                                        angel of justice. In the final scenes,
                                        where she hunts down killer Martin
                                        Vanger on her motorbike, she
                                        doesn&#8217;t ask for permission to do
                                        so; she just watches him burn to death,
                                        deaf to his pleas for mercy. It&#8217;s
                                        a beautiful scene. There&#8217;s steel
                                        in her eyes and mouth. It explicitly
                                        echoes her own setting alight of her
                                        father &#8211; a parallel only hinted at
                                        in the remake &#8211; and her associate
                                        Mikael Blomqvist (Michael Nyqvist) is
                                        amazed and disgusted with her when he
                                        learns of her actions, which allows
                                        Lisbeth to give her gorgeous
                                        &#8220;Don&#8217;t make him into a
                                        victim&#8221; speech.<\/p>\n
                                        <p>
                                          Original Lisbeth is a human. Plenty of
                                          design decisions have lead to this:
                                          she has eyebrows, for a start, which
                                          do a lot to shape her face and give
                                          her expression. She has make-up that
                                          looks like a professional taught her
                                          how. She wears colours other than
                                          black. Her skin is unblemished, and
                                          her nails are short and neat. She
                                          carries herself with quiet pride, and
                                          her eyes are alive with Noomi
                                          Rapace&#8217;s trademark razor-sharp
                                          observational glare. Her hair lies
                                          flat a lot of the time.<\/p>\n
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                          She&#8217;s as brusque and vicious as
                                          you&#8217;d expect, but she shakes
                                          people&#8217;s hands. She makes eye
                                          contact and
                                          <em
                                            >says things<\/em>. And all this
                                            fleshes her out as a character in
                                            more explicit ways that a viewer can
                                            relate to &#8211; it&#8217;s easier
                                            to form an empathic bond with a
                                            character who has dialogue,
                                            obviously &#8211; but she&#8217;s a
                                            lot more human. And yes, I do
                                            actually count that as a bad
                                            thing.<\/p>\n
