    >Team BadRep were put on the spot again this month: in the wake of <a

    Batgirl<\/a> igniting the gender-and-comics conversation loud
    &#8216;n&#8217; proud, the team were asked to take a look at their favourite
    comic book titles and characters &#8211; some obvious choices, some less
    so&#8230; here&#8217;s Sarah C&#8217;s take.<br \ />\n<\/strong><\/p>\n
    <p>
      Ah, comics. Or
      <em
        >graphic novels<\/em>, if they are trying to seduce me across a pseudy
        coffee bar in Edinburgh, which they did &#8211; more on that
        later.<\/p>\n
        <p>
          Dear reader, this is a tale of a long, passionate, but fractious love
          affair.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          It started early. I noticed them, but they never seemed to be the
          right one for me, stocked as they were in the &#8220;boys&#8217;
          section&#8221; of the magazine racks. I kept myself busy with the
          garish colours of the (probably) gender neutral <a
          href=\"http:\/\/www.dandy.com\/\"><strong
            >Dandy<\/strong><\/a> and the <a
            href=\"http:\/\/www.beano.com\/\"><strong
              >Beano<\/strong><\/a>. Whilst being amused but ultimately
              concerned by the levels of naughtiness from <a
              href=\"http:\/\/www.beano.com\/characters\/minnie-the-minx\">Minnie
              the Minx<\/a> (I was a very conscientious child), I found myself
              captured by a few sections from the pages of hand-me-down copies
              of the now-defunct &#8220;girls&#8217; own&#8221; annual <a
              href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bunty\"><strong
                >Bunty<\/strong><\/a>. Looking back on it, the artwork was poor
                and the storylines were hammy with a sprinkling of schmaltz, but
                some stood out: tales of mystery, adventure, aliens and heroines
                were hidden amidst the pages of dreary &#8220;girl stuff&#8221;.

                  Flash forward, and I&#8217;m at university in Edinburgh with
                  actual money in my pocket. I&#8217;ve caught flickers of

                                              The character of Grandma Ben
                                              blasts away so many female
                                              stereotypes. She is mysterious,
                                              strong, forthright, takes no
                                              nonsense and just plain
                                              funny.\u00a0 She also races cows.
                                              As in, races against them. I aim
                                              to also do this when I am her age
                                              (which she refuses to tell anyone,
                                              of course).<\/p>\n
