<p>
  I had a day out with my Mum the other week, and feeling safely cosseted
  between the matriarchal protective spheres of Mum and Marks &amp; Spencers, I
  decided to brave a thing I dread: bra shopping. <\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  I hate bra shopping. Generally I&#8217;m not a massive fan of shopping per se;
  it usually feels like a massive waste of time I could spend doing something
  <em
    >actually<\/em> relaxing, like having a cup of tea, or wandering around a
    museum. Or sleeping. Anything, really. But I digress.<\/p>\n

      \/><\/a>Bras. I hate them. Where to begin my hatred? A little history,
      perhaps. I do like a little historical context to flavour a problem. Makes
      me feel like a proper academic. Except one who uses wikpedia entries a lot
      &#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Brassiere\">like this
      one here.<\/a><\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      To summarise: basically there was nothing for quite a while (when
      literally people didn&#8217;t wear much at all), then there were togas (or
      for the ladies, <a
      href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Stola\">stolas<\/a>) and people
      didn&#8217;t really care, then all of a sudden there were all kinds of
      things dedicated to &#8220;dealing with breasts&#8221;. There were bits of
      cloth in various arrangements with and without padding, corsets, bodices,
      and finally something that resembled the modern bra.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Which was <a
      href=\"http:\/\/womenshistory.about.com\/od\/mythsofwomenshistory\/a\/bra_burning.htm\">never
      burned, incidently<\/a>, except possibly in awful household fires. And we
      had the <a
      href=\"http:\/\/desertblondie.hubpages.com\/hub\/Madonnas-80s-Cone-Bramaking-a-comeback\">Madonna
      cone bra<\/a>, of course.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the Wonderbra with its rallying cry of <a
      href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wonderbra\"><em
        >Hello Boys<\/em><\/a>, and to be honest I was never 100% clear on
        whether she was advertising her mammaries
        <em
          >to<\/em> boys, or addressing them
          <em
            >as<\/em> boys, and it all got all a bit confusing so I tried not to
            think about it. Plus it arrived when I was 14, which is a Bad Time
            for bosom-related upset.<\/p>\n
            <p>
              Skip forward a bit further and we get Shakira <a
              href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=weRHyjj34ZE\">declaring<\/a>
              in 2002 that it&#8217;s:<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                Lucky that my breasts are small and humble<br \ />\nSo you
                don&#8217;t confuse them with mountains\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                &#8230; which I&#8217;m still not really sure about, because,
                again, we&#8217;re getting all obsessed over size. Small or big?
                Which is better? (And why do we have to have better bodies
                anyway?) <\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                My own &#8216;humble&#8217; beginnings: for me, the bra was a
                graduation from the pre-teen crop top and the childish vest into
                the world of being a Real Woman. Periods were also involved in
                this uncomfortable phase (and they are also rubbish and make
                your breasts sore, but you do not have to go to the shop and pay
                money for them). This was not a good start for the bra and I,
                and it didn&#8217;t get any better.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                The portion of my adult life that I&#8217;ve spent around bras
                has always involved the fickle inconsistency of measurements. As
                an experiment, on my shopping trip I got measured in three
                different shops and tried on more bloody bras than I have done
                in my entire life. I am, for the record a 34, 36 or 32 A, B or
                C. So that&#8217;s not really a good start. Furthermore, none of
                these bras, in any of those official sizes,
                <em
                  >actually<\/em> fit my chest. Some do better than others, but
                  there is no general indicator of agreed size.<\/p>\n
                  <p>
                    Let&#8217;s talk about what they look
                    like.\u00a0They&#8217;re mostly quite &#8216;girly&#8217;,
                    except where they&#8217;re meant to be &#8216;sexy&#8217;.
                    Ah, that old problem again. I can have a virgin bra or a
                    whore bra. Great. They contain a lot of extraneous stuff
                    like lace and bows and other frou-frou items that my bosom
                    really doesn&#8217;t need, so I spend a lot of time snipping
                    things off bras whilst hoping that the sheer volume of stuff
                    I&#8217;m lopping off isn&#8217;t in some way structurally
                    vital.<\/p>\n
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And what about underwire, while we&#8217;re at it? No item
                    of clothing aimed at men, designed to sit on sensitive, soft
                    flesh, would include metal wire within a flimsy silk and
                    lace contraption, frequently destined to poke out and
                    puncture your poor, unsuspecting skin. Underwire, together
                    with its evil cousin Padding, is the great illusionist of
                    the bra world. This is not a world in which the bra is only
                    there to clothe, support or protect you. No, it is not a
                    knight in shining armour: the bra is a churl and a pimp. It
                    exists to
                    <em
                      >make your tits look nice<\/em>. And by &#8220;nice&#8221;
                      I mean bigger and with cleavage. As opposed to, say, the
                      way they actually look.<\/p>\n
                      <p>
                        Being realistic, since my breasts are not large: I
                        don&#8217;t
                        <em
                          >have<\/em> a cleavage without serious amounts of
                          bra-mirage work, without which any
                          &#8220;revealing&#8221; top tends to reveal a lot
                          of&#8230; sternum. It&#8217;s nice sternum, but
                          it&#8217;s not the look I&#8217;m
                          &#8220;supposed&#8221; to have.\u00a0 And even when
                          I&#8217;m wearing the damn thing, it doesn&#8217;t
                          fit. The cups leave gaps where my breasts are not. The
                          straps are too tight or too loose, leaving red marks
                          in my ribs and creating weird bumps of flesh around
                          the sides or under my arms that an anxious person
                          might negatively label &#8220;fat&#8221;. In the panic
                          room of the changing cubicle, it&#8217;s easy to get
                          worried. Especially when one&#8217;s chest appears to
                          be both &#8220;fat&#8221; and &#8220;small&#8221; at
                          the same time.<\/p>\n
                          <p>
                            Simply put, bras aren&#8217;t designed for my body
                            shape. The fact that the bra is a quintessentially
                            &#8220;feminine&#8221; object makes me feel
                            unfeminine. Sometimes I&#8217;m okay with that.
                            Sometimes I&#8217;m not. And all of this creates the
                            sneaking suspicion that my own breasts are not
                            socially adequate by themselves. It isn&#8217;t nice
                            to feel like your body is inadequate. And for the
                            most part nowadays, I don&#8217;t. But I used to. A
                            lot. Especially as an unhappy teenager. Various
                            problems with food ensued. It was not a good time,
                            and it is a not good time that many women (and men)
                            go through.<\/p>\n
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            But bras are not solely the enemy of
                            &#8220;small&#8221; women. Curvy ladies also loathe
                            bras, and perhaps with even more reason. For them,
                            the bra is often essential. The larger the bra
                            required, the more expensive it is. Also &#8211; so
                            I&#8217;m told &#8211; the more complicated the
                            re-arranging of weight around the body, creating
                            more lines of soreness across the shoulders and an
                            additional aesthetic difficulty of &#8216;too
                            much&#8217; cleavage at inappropriate times.<\/p>\n
                          </p>
                          <p>Seriously, fuck bras.<\/p>\n</p>
                          <p>
                            <strong
                              >But what to do about it all?<\/strong><\/p>\n
                              <ul>
                                \n
                                <li>
                                  <em
                                    >Stop wearing them altogether?<\/em> Easy
                                    for me to say, as long as the weather
                                    isn&#8217;t cold and it doesn&#8217;t rain,
                                    but this won&#8217;t do for the
                                    larger-breasted, for whom some element of
                                    mammary management is essential to personal
                                    comfort. Similarly, I can&#8217;t go
                                    bra-less all the time &#8211; even for
                                    someone my size a trip to the gym requires
                                    something to stop the painful
                                    bouncing.<\/li>\n
                                    <li>
                                      <em
                                        >Buy other bras?<\/em> I keep being told
                                        that if I was only measured
                                        &#8220;correctly&#8221; I would be fine.
                                        I&#8217;m disputing this, because
                                        I&#8217;ve been measured a lot, and
                                        measuring me doesn&#8217;t seem to alter
                                        the sizes of bras which persist in being
                                        made for a particular shape of wearer
                                        who is not my shape. A lot of
                                        women&#8217;s clothes are like this. I
                                        shop around for those. Perhaps there are
                                        magical bra shops where one can purchase
                                        perfect fitting, soft and comfortable
                                        bras for around a tenner. I doubt it,
                                        though.<\/li>\n
