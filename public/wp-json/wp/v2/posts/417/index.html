<p>
  There&#8217;s been a lot of controversy in the world of Sci-fi books recently,
  over attitudes to both women and minorities.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  A blogger for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.apexbookcompany.com\">Apex Books<\/a>
  called Gustavo Bondoni wrote <A
  href=\"http:\/\/www.apexbookcompany.com\/2010\/10\/plucking-the-pc-parrots-in-the-genre-world\/\"
  \/>this piece of trolling, misogynist racefail horseshit<\/a>, ranting against
  positive discrimination and the &#8220;PC&#8221; police, etc. He was referring
  to those people who voiced an opinion on <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/Mammoth-Book-Mindblowing-SF-Books\/dp\/1845298918\/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top\/276-3853233-3532246\"><strong
    >The Mammoth Book of Mindblowing SF<\/strong><\/a> being a mammoth book of
    only white male authors. No women, no minorities&#8230; all white, all
    men.<\/p>\n
    <p>
      One of the people he&#8217;s complaining about is the glorious <a
      href=\"http:\/\/www.catherynnemvalente.com\/\">Catherynne M Valente<\/a>,
      a fantasy and sci-fi author and editor, whose writing I love a whole lot.
      (I&#8217;ll get the recs out of the way: her World Fantasy Award
      nominated, Mythopoeic Award winning
      <strong
        >The Orphan&#8217;s Tales<\/strong> and Hugo nominated
        <strong
          >Palimpsest<\/strong> for starters). The small snag here being that
          <strong
            >Apex<\/strong> is the company she edits a magazine for, so people
            asked her opinions of his blogpost.<\/p>\n
            <p>
              Now, there&#8217;s the old argument that if you&#8217;re pulling
              from the Golden Age of sci-fi, most authors WERE men. But this
              book isn&#8217;t only about that period, and the list of superb
              female SFF authors is long and mighty. CL Moore, <a
              href=\"http:\/\/www.ursulakleguin.com\/\">Ursula K. Le Guin<\/a>,
              Joanna Russ, Octavia Butler, Marge Piercy&#8230; (believe me, I
              could add 20 more names here with no effort). Much more if you
              include Fantasy as a genre alongside it. There are 3 female SF
              Grandmasters, and truly great female SF writing goes back a long
              way (it&#8217;s traditional to cite Mary Shelley for
              <strong
                >Frankenstein<\/strong>).<\/p>\n
                <p>
                  Besides, you shouldn&#8217;t mess with sci-fi nerds, they know
                  math: one commenter on the Mammoth book post worked out that
                  even if 3 out of 4 authors were white males, and the other 1
                  in 4 category contained *everyone* else, there was still only
                  a 0.2% chance of all 21 stories being written by white guys.
                  This wasn&#8217;t a case of &#8220;but it&#8217;s
                  representative of there being genuinely no minorities in SF
                  writing&#8221;. The chance of that being true is something
                  like 0.2% depending on the actual ratios (you have to get up
                  to 95% white males before it even hits 50\/50).<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  So Bondoni wrote his deliberately baiting blogpost, trying to
                  raise some controversy, and Cat Valente posted what she
                  thought of it.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  It turns out <a
                  href=\"http:\/\/yuki-onna.livejournal.com\/614239.html\">she&#8217;s
                  tired and bored, but with more swearing<\/a>:<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    I&#8217;m not saying &#8220;ignore the bully and he&#8217;ll
                    go away.&#8221; Nope. Shred away. It&#8217;s what he wants,
                    so he can continue to feel persecuted, and very likely keep
                    believing that the mythical PC harpies are why he&#8217;s
                    not a star of page and screen. It&#8217;s fun to feel
                    persecuted &#8211; if you&#8217;re persecuted, it usually
                    means you&#8217;re right, and at the mercy of wicked souls.
                    It&#8217;s not actually fun to
                    <strong
                      >be<\/strong> persecuted, but if you can get that feeling
                      while sitting at home with no one oppressing you?
                      Profit.<\/p>\n
                      <p>
                        He&#8217;s using us &#8211; because he knows he
                        can&#8217;t get the internet crowds to look at him any
                        other way, he simply calls us playground names. And
                        that&#8217;s what the phrase PC is these days &#8211;
                        name calling. No one who actually believes in
                        <strong
                          >not intentionally hurting other humans<\/strong> uses
                          that phrase anymore. It&#8217;s pretty much solely
                          used to insist that mobs of people who don&#8217;t
                          look like the user are constantly beating down his
                          door to force him to
                          <strong
                            >be nice<\/strong>. Poor f***ing baby. My heart
                            bleeds for you, sweetheart.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n
                            <p>
                              I just wanted to give a little cheer, because I
                              think her whole post is excellent.<\/p>\n
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Next time, Mr Bondoni, don&#8217;t pick a fight
                              with the woman who responded to <A
                              href=\"http:\/\/worldsf.wordpress.com\/2010\/09\/16\/elizabeth-moon-on-islam\/\"
                              \/>Elizabeth Moon&#8217;s astonishing anti-Muslim
                              rant<\/a> by dedicating the entire next issue of
                              Apex magazine to only contain stories from Arab
                              and Muslim writers. (That issue comes out soon,
                              and I can&#8217;t wait).<\/p>\n
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Now, we could say that picking arguments over
                              statistics and always demanding equal
                              representation is too aggressive a behaviour, that
                              it doesn&#8217;t help feminism or that we&#8217;d
                              be better off just leaving losers like Bondoni
                              alone. Cat&#8217;s point is that we&#8217;re all
                              tired of it, we&#8217;ve all seen it before, and
                              the arguments against positive discrimination (if
                              that even applied here, which I don&#8217;t think
                              it does) will keep coming from the poor oppressed
                              traditional majority.<\/p>\n
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              But when the comments to the original announcement
                              of the

                                precisely why the fight isn&#8217;t over
                                yet<\/a>, I think I can find the energy to keep
                                opposing.<\/p>\n
                                <p>
                                  Sci-fi should be a field where we can leave
                                  prejudices behind, especially those based on
                                  tradition and culture. It is the greatest
                                  genre for wiping away the assumptions that the
                                  ratio of power between genders should be the
                                  same as in the modern day, or that race or
                                  religion (or even money) have to divide people
                                  the way they do. I love sci-fi for
                                  this.<\/p>\n
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  But it also contains its share of famously
                                  right-wing intolerant viewpoints, and
                                  that&#8217;s a reminder that even in this free
                                  and imaginative literary space we can&#8217;t
                                  stop pushing to improve things. I think Cat is
                                  right: hearing Bondoni&#8217;s arguments yet
                                  again is boring, and providing him with the
                                  drama he wants is pointless&#8230; but taking
                                  a stance against his views isn&#8217;t. We
                                  still hear people complaining about things
                                  being &#8220;too PC&#8221; daily, that fight
                                  is a long way from over yet.<\/p>\n<div
