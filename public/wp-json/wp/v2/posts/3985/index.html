  Most people who read feminist blogs won&#8217;t even need me to explain this
  title. We see it every day.<\/p>\n

    >International Women&#8217;s Day<\/strong> on the 8th of March turned
    Twitter into an amazing parade of support for women, delight in their
    progress towards equality and celebration of the women in each of our
    lives.<\/p>\n
    <p>
      Elsewhere, it was business as usual. If you could have hashtagged
      &#8220;<em
        >Why don&#8217;t men get a day, EH?<\/em>&#8221; then it&#8217;d have
        been the global number one tag all over the internet. (They do get a day
        &#8211; <a
        href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/International_Men's_Day\">November
        19th<\/a> &#8211; but that&#8217;s not my point here.) I&#8217;m writing
        this post so that next year I can just link it every time someone tells
        me feminism &#8220;isn&#8217;t needed&#8221; or is unfair to men in some
        way.<\/p>\n
        <p>
          To the people (all of whom were men) who had to ask me what the title
          of this post meant: look at almost any online article about
          women&#8217;s rights or feminism. Chances are within the first few
          comments you will have a man asking &#8220;What about men&#8217;s
          rights?&#8221;<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          As <a href=\"www.weareequals.org\">the James Bond clip which did the
          rounds<\/a> quotes: &#8220;Women perform 66% of the world&#8217;s
          work, earn 10% of world&#8217;s income and own 1% of the world&#8217;s
          property.&#8221; What about the men? Fine. Let&#8217;s reverse that
          for a new quote:<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Men perform 33% of the world&#8217;s work, earn 90% of world&#8217;s
            income and own 99% of the world&#8217;s
            property.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            They also suffer much less domestic violence, rape, genital
            mutilation, sexual shame, sex trafficking, and have far more control
            over their lives and bodies. Their options for work aren&#8217;t
            limited, they are not considered to automatically have a duty to
            represent their whole gender if they reach the top of a profession
            or political office, and aren&#8217;t scrutinised as mercilessly if
            their partner does.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            They don&#8217;t face becoming part of the epidemic of rape during
            war, having their testimony count for half a man&#8217;s in court,
            legal challenges on precisely how much they are allowed to be beaten
            before it&#8217;s not acceptable, they&#8217;re far less likely to
            face
            <em
              >being property<\/em>, victims of honour killings and acid
              attacks, or living under social or legal pressure to hide their
              bodies from sight (or the more familiar pressure in the UK to
              expose them, provided they&#8217;re the &#8216;correct&#8217;
              shape, if they want to be successful).<\/p>\n
              <p>
                Speaking as a white cis male in a first world country, if you
                can&#8217;t see why feminism &#8216;is still needed&#8217;
                globally then you haven&#8217;t tried looking for even a second.
                We may have a different set of inequalities at home, but that
                doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re not just as pervasive and
                damaging in society. Is the UK some amazing bastion of freedom
                where women have no problems anymore? <a
                href=\"http:\/\/www.equalityhumanrights.com\/human-rights\/international-womens-day-2011\/how-fair-is-britain-for-women\/\">The
                Equality and Human Rights Commission says a BIG no.<\/a><\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                Other people raised a much more valid secondary point during
                International Women&#8217;s Day, which was the hesitation a lot
                of men have about the
                <em
                  >word<\/em> &#8216;feminism&#8217;. Even though the movement
                  is about seeking equality, the term
                  <em
                    >suggests<\/em> seeking female superiority to a lot of
                    people. It&#8217;s been debated constantly in feminist
                    circles, but we sometimes forget that this instinctive
                    mis-definition hasn&#8217;t changed in the minds of many of
                    the mainstream. The argument about reclaiming it (and then
                    making the version we want actually take root in the general
                    public) is a whole post on its own, and not what I want to
                    do here. <a
                    href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/2011\/03\/07\/what-does-feminism-look-like\/\">We
                    know that feminism has an image problem.<\/a><\/p>\n
                    <p>
                      For our readers (of any gender) who may be in doubt, here
                      is my personal definition: feminism is about womens&#8217;
                      right to live as human beings. To make choices about their
                      own lives and bodies. Things which we would consider
                      imprisonment or torture on &#8216;a person&#8217; are
                      inflicted on women every day, and equality is not going to
                      happen without a lot of effort to fight that status quo.
                      Reaching equality doesn&#8217;t take anything away from
                      men that we should not be ashamed of and glad to lose
                      anyway.<\/p>\n
