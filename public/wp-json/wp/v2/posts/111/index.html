    What fascinated Ermengarde the most was [Sara&#8217;s] fancy about the dolls
    who walked and talked, and who could do anything they chose when the human
    beings were out of the room, but who must keep their powers a secret and so
    flew back to their places &#8216;like lightening&#8217; when people returned
    to the room.<\/p>\n

      <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Barbie\">Barbara Millicent
      Roberts<\/a> is actually, it turns out, called Dorothy. At least, a
      &#8216;Barbie doll&#8217; is a tautology, since the word
      &#8216;doll&#8217; itself was originally a nickname. (Rs and Ls are
      colloquially interchangeable, donchaknow &#8211; see also Harry\/Hal,
      Mary\/Moll.)<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8216;Doll&#8217; as a name makes an early debut in renaissance drama:
      first as Doll Tearsheet in Shakespeare&#8217;s
      <strong
        >Henry IV<\/strong> and then as Doll Common in Jonson&#8217;s
        <strong
          >The Alchemist<\/strong>. These two draw in &#8216;Doll&#8217;s&#8217;
          second meaning, which assumes a &#8216;Dorothy&#8217; is so common a
          species as to be generic. Thus, &#8216;Doll&#8217; as a pet name is
          quickly expanded to indicate any female &#8216;pet&#8217;, or indeed
          any female &#8216;mistress&#8217; (drawing confused attention to the
          potentially infantalising properties of nicknames in general).
          Additionally, as of 1560, it could also be used to mean &#8216;the
          smallest or pet pig in the litter&#8217; (<a
          href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Charlotte's_Web\">like
          Wilbur<\/a>). But clearly there is a double edge to Dorothy&#8217;s
          common-ness, since &#8216;common&#8217; means &#8216;for the use of
          everyone&#8217; (tee hee) as well as &#8216;numerous&#8217; \u2013
          something Doll Common&#8217;s character demonstrates nominally. ENTER
          THE PROSTITUTE.<\/p>\n

            Work and Play<\/h3>\n
            <p>
              It is only in 1700 that &#8216;Doll&#8217; loses its capital
              letter and acquires something of its modern sense. The dictionary
              defines this as &#8216;an image of a human being (commonly of a
              child or lady) used as a plaything; a girl&#8217;s
              toy-baby&#8217;. It is no longer a name, but it still stands in
              for something else, with a more spiritual implication in\u00a0dear
              Shakespeare&#8217;s
              <strong
                >Romeo and Juliet<\/strong> (that name-obsessed play). Here, Old
                Capulet refers to his daughter as a &#8216;whining
                Mammet&#8217;, a deviant form of &#8216;Maumet&#8217; which,
                deriving ultimately from &#8216;Mohammed&#8217;, was a term used
                in medieval England to mean &#8216;a puppet, an idol, a
                doll&#8217;. Here lurks the second commandment, in all its
                thorny glory, giving an added layer to Barbie&#8217;s iconicism,
                not to mention the groom&#8217;s pledge to his bride in the
                traditional Marriage Service, &#8216;With my body I thee
                worship&#8217;. (I hear the clatter of toppling
                pedestals.)<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_257\" style=\"width:

                  <em
                    >girls <\/em>who play with dolls, and there is a pleasing
                    juxtaposition of frivolous and stern in the
                    dictionary&#8217;s reference to &#8216;playthings&#8217;
                    &#8230; but I cannot help but suspect that, in their initial
                    incarnation, these &#8216;doll-babies&#8217; were
                    occasionally also educational tools, teaching the virtues of
                    maternal care for something smaller and weaker, sartorial
                    elegance and grooming and presumably also some degree of
                    etiquette \u2013 these dolls could, after all, represent all
                    ages, and I suspect that the comparative decline of the over
                    18s represented in modern doll-land may also signal a
                    movement from dolls as work to dolls as play. (Incidentally,
                    Londoners: for more on toys&#8217; super-seriousness, go

                    <p>
                      From play to work, there&#8217;s a beautiful reference in
                      the dictionary to &#8216;doll&#8217; used in the more
                      modern sense when, in 1860, the journal
                      <em
                        >All Year Round<\/em> talks about the &#8216;laborious
                        class Who earn painful bread by fashioning dolls&#8217;
                        eyes&#8217;, which tellingly hints at the expanded
                        manufacturing operations doll-craft represented by the
                        mid-Victorian industrialised era \u2013 a far cry from
                        what would presumably have been an ad-hoc domestic craft
                        when &#8216;doll-babies&#8217; first became popular.
                        <strong
                          >A Little Princess<\/strong>, quoted above, is a story
                          obsessed with the power of make-believe and dolls as
                          synecdoches for real-life figures. It features
                          multiple references to the late-Victorian doll and the
                          materialism she represents, including the disapproval
                          of Sara Crewe&#8217;s family solicitor, who, on seeing
                          what Sara dubs &#8216;The Last Doll&#8217; says
                          sternly &#8216;A hundred pounds [&#8230;] All
                          expensive material, and made at a Parisian
                          modiste&#8217;s. He spent money lavishly enough, that
                          young man&#8217;. Fans of Victorian women&#8217;s
                          studies may think of Dickens&#8217; Mr Merdle (<em
                            >Little Dorrit<\/em>) and his search, not for a
                            wife, but for &#8216;a bosom to hang jewels
                            upon&#8217;.<\/p>\n

                                It has taken more time than usual, but finally
                                the leximobile screeches up outside definition
                                number three, another Victorian usage,
                                &#8216;doll&#8217; as &#8216;a pretty, but
                                unintelligent or empty person&#8217;,
                                especially, the dictionary adds, &#8216;when
                                dressed up; also, a pretty but silly or
                                frivolous woman&#8217;. Hence we have &#8216;a
                                doll&#8217;s face&#8217;, which is one
                                &#8216;conventionally pretty, but without life
                                or expression&#8217;. Pleasingly, in this
                                instance, it is the lifeless image of womanhood
                                that inspires the\u00a0pejorative\u00a0reference
                                to the real thing, rather than the other way
                                round, although it gives rise to a disturbing
                                number of aspirations in the sentient race to be
                                &#8216;living dolls&#8217; (a quick google, and
                                you&#8217;ll see what I mean). The dictionary
                                even has names for this sort of thing, giving a
                                delightful number of compound terms: thus the
