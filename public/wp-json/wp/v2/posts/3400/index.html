  According to X &amp; Y Communications, an agency (apparently) specialising in
  the impact of gender differences on business, <a title=\"Daily Telegraph: What
  Do Women Want From Cars\"
  href=\"http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/motoring\/columnists\/neil-lyndon\/8294019\/What-do-women-want-from-cars.html\"
  target=\"_blank\"> women ask themselves one fundamental question<\/a> when
  contemplating the purchase of a car. Is it the price?, I hear you wonder. Is
  it the safety rating, or the fuel efficiency?<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  No. It&#8217;s:
  <em
    >&#8220;Will it make me look hotter when I step out of it outside a bar or
    restaurant?&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n
    <p>
      Yes, the main thing that will make a woman decide on a particular car is
      how &#8216;hot&#8217; she feels in it.

            According to Lyndon, his wife&#8217;s divorced friend ignored all
            sensible, practical considerations when making her car choice, and
            simply went for a pretty French hatchback. Because that&#8217;s what
            women do, of course: we go for the pretty option despite it possibly
            being on fire.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            The thing is &#8211; and this will come as no surprise to those
            familiar with his prior work &#8211; Lyndon is talking complete
            twaddle. According to AutoEbid.com&#8217;s <a title=\"AutoEbid.com's
            Help Me Choose a New Car\"
            href=\"http:\/\/www.autoebid.com\/help-me-choose.asp\">Help Me
            Choose a New Car<\/a> function, you can choose from six factors when
            trying to find the perfect car for you. They are: Comfort, Styling,
            Handling, Depreciation, Economy, and Safety. The price is a liming
            criterion: the thing that helps you to narrow your choice, rather
            than the main principle of selection. In fact, unless you are going
            into the market with an extremely limited amount of money, the cost
            of the car will only ever help you to select a class, or possibly a
            financing option. Put it another way: no one will switch from a
            brand-new Fiat 500 to a second-hand Volvo XC90, even though both can
            be had for roughly \u00a310k.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            So how do people choose cars, then, if it&#8217;s not the
            price?<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            1. First and foremost, functionality. What are you going to use the
            car for? If you have five children that will need running to school
            every morning, you will probably end up with that Volvo. If, on the
            other hand, you&#8217;re looking for an urban runabout, something
            small and easy to park is probably better.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            2. Up there as a consideration is styling: you want it to look good.
            In fact, certain TV shows have gone so far as to have an entire
            segment over whether <a title=\"The Cool Wall\"
            href=\"http:\/\/topgear.cloudapp.net\/default.aspx\">a car is
            &#8216;cool&#8217; or not<\/a>. The guide there, by the way, is
            whether a cool person would drive it. Perhaps X &amp; Y
            Communications neglected to canvas the Top Gear audience in their
            research.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            3. The last, all encompassing question is: I live with it? This
            includes things like reliability, fuel economy, ability to park it
            in London, whether the suspension will destroy your spine the first
            time you drive over road-humps.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            The &#8216;price&#8217; question helps to narrow your options, and,
            on occasion, to disabuse you of the notion that you really could
            afford to buy a supercar if you sell the house and both
            kidneys.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            The key question Lyndon ignored was what his wife&#8217;s friend
            wanted in a car: she wanted a cute little urban runabout that would
            cheer her up in the mornings. Put simply, she wanted that &#8216;new
            car&#8217; feeling: you&#8217;ve chosen well, your car looks good,
            and you love it more than it is natural to love an inanimate object.
            If she was a man lovingly polishing his vintage (decrepit) Rolls,
            Lyndon would have smiled indulgently.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            What Lyndon is bemoaning is not women&#8217;s tendency to pick cars
            that make them look good &#8211; we all do that. No one has ever
            looked at a car and thought, &#8220;sure, it&#8217;s beautiful, but
            given the choice I&#8217;d go for the ugly, uncomfortable one on the
            left.&#8221;\u00a0 Our budgets and priorities may vary, but the
            intent remains the same. You buy the thing that makes you feel happy
            when you&#8217;re inside it. Lyndon seems to have forgotten that, or
            have momentarily blanked out all car adverts, ever. It&#8217;s such
            an established clich\u00e9 that car makers can now produce
            meta-tastic pastiches of previous ads and we lap it up. Check out
            this Volvo V60 &#8220;How to make a sexy car advert&#8221;

                Of course, that&#8217;s really the thing Lyndon is taking an
                issue with.
                <em
                  >He<\/em> wanted his wife&#8217;s friend to go away and make a
                  list of her requirements, and bring back the top three cars
                  that fulfilled them. He would then counsel her to make the
                  reasoned, practical decision.
                  <em
                    >She<\/em> wanted to buy a cool hatchback following a messy
                    divorce. The thing is, women going through messy divorces
                    are not meant to want cool hatchbacks. They&#8217;re not
                    meant to want anything funky or stylish. They should be
                    worried about making ends meet, and where the rent is coming
                    from, and how they&#8217;re going to get to work now that
                    their ex-husband has custody of the car. No divorced woman
                    should want to look or feel attractive, and she certainly
                    shouldn&#8217;t be be gallivanting around bars or
                    restaurants. I could choose this point to make a catty
                    comment about how Lyndon left his wife for another woman, <a
                    title=\"No More Sex War\"
                    href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/More-Sex-War-Neil-Lyndon\/dp\/0749315652\/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1298924959&amp;sr=8-2\">published

                    of feminism&#8221; and has since been struggling to rebuild
                    his career.<\/p>\n
                    <p>
                      Lyndon&#8217;s article reveals nothing about gender or,
                      indeed, about car choice (and I highly doubt the odious Mr
                      Lyndon chose his own car based on a set of requirements
                      and flowcharts). All it shows us is how deep his
                      prejudices still lie: a woman who is hard up and urgently
                      needs a car should not, in Lyndon&#8217;s world, get to
                      make that sort of choice. Having asked his advice, she
                      should have acknowledged his superiority and allowed him
                      to select one for her. After all, her preference for a
                      &#8220;chic little French-made hatchback&#8221; instantly
                      indicated to him that she must not have the know-how to do
                      it herself.<\/p>\n

                      Lyndon&#8217;s ire: well, it&#8217;s not doing too badly,
