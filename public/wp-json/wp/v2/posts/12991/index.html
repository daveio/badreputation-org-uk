                famous roleplaying game in the world, the route most people got
                into roleplaying, and the flagship of the hobby. So it&#8217;s a
                tragedy that the game is pushing away potential fans through
                artwork and even game text that is overwhelmingly focused on one

                  That\u2019s a pretty provocative statement, right there. But
                  I\u2019m confident in making it, because the evidence is there
                  for anyone who wants to see it. You could start by flipping
                  open a copy of pretty much any D&amp;D book and looking
                  through the artwork. See how many women and people of colour
                  you can find \u2013 and then see how many of them are
                  half-dressed or made to look weak or submissive.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  Actually, you don\u2019t need to, because someone already did
                  it for you. Anna Kreider <a
                  href=\"http:\/\/www.pelgranepress.com\/?p=3501\"
                  target=\"_blank\">reviewed the artwork in the D&amp;D 4th
                  edition<\/a> books (specifically the
                  <strong
                    >Dungeon Master\u2019s Guide<\/strong>,
                    <strong
                      >Players Handbook<\/strong>,
                      <strong
                        >Players Handbook 2<\/strong> and the
                        <strong
                          >Adventurer\u2019s Vault<\/strong>) and rated the
                          images therein.<\/p>\n
                          <p>
                            Kreider\u2019s findings were striking \u2013 of the
                            40% or so of humans (and demi-humans) that were
                            depicted as female, well over a third hit each of
                            the measures she chose (being half-dressed or posed
                            in a sexually suggestive way, for instance).
                            Needless to say, the remaining 60% of images, the
                            ones which were of men, tended to be wearing more
                            clothes, in more active, non-sexual poses.<\/p>\n
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            It gets better, because Chris Van Dyke <a
                            href=\"http:\/\/raceindnd.wordpress.com\/2008\/11\/18\/nerd-nite-presentation-november-18th-2008\/\"
                            target=\"_blank\">had a look at D&amp;D from the
                            perspective of race<\/a>. He was able to find only
                            two examples of a non-white character in the core
                            books of all four numbered editions of D&amp;D. That
                            means non-white folks are practically invisible in
                            D&amp;D.<\/p>\n
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Now, these findings are based on subjective
                            judgements. That\u2019s unavoidable, because things
                            like \u201csexually suggestive\u201d and
                            \u201cwhite\u201d can often only be judged
                            subjectively in artwork. You can go and judge for
                            yourself if you doubt their conclusions. But I think
                            if we\u2019re honest, these results only confirm
                            what most of us already knew from experience.<\/p>\n
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            It isn\u2019t the end of the world. I\u2019ve
                            enjoyed lots of pop culture replete with sexism. And
                            after all, it\u2019s only a fantasy! But then again,
                            shouldn\u2019t our fantasy worlds contain a richer
                            variety of creatures than real life? And what does
                            it say to potential new gamers if they can\u2019t
                            find a picture of someone like them anywhere in
                            these books? Is D&amp;D really just a game about
                            white dudes slugging it out in a dungeon somewhere?
                            I don\u2019t think so.<\/p>\n
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            OK, so what to do about it? I love roleplaying, and
                            despite years of moaning about the mechanics, I
                            still love D&amp;D. The fact that it\u2019s not
                            exactly a beacon of gender and racial equality is,
                            for me, an obstacle to be overcome rather than a
                            sign I should give up on the game altogether.<\/p>\n

                            target=\"_blank\">signed it<\/a>, and better yet

                            The petition won\u2019t change anything in itself.
                            Wizards of the Coast could ignore it, and maybe they
                            will. But if they can see that there are hundreds of
                            gamers out there who want more than whitewash and
                            chainmail bikinis, maybe they\u2019ll respond. We
                            owe it to the hobby to give them a clear
                            message.<\/p>\n
