  Inspired by those plucky Pussy Riot gals and their &#8216;being sent to a
  penal colony for a peaceful protest&#8217; hi-jinks in Russia last year, I set
  out to find tracks from riot grrrl bands around the world. And just to shift
  the focus for once, I&#8217;ve ignored the US, Canada, Australia, Japan,
  Europe and other super wealthy places.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  &#8216;Are there grrrls in the majority world?&#8217; I wondered. The answer
  is yes, and they rock. In fact I&#8217;ve made a <a title=\"Majority World
  Riot Grrrl Playlist\" href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/majoritygrrrl\"
  target=\"_blank\"><strong
    >Majority World Riot Grrrl playlist<\/strong><\/a> which can be found for
    your delectation. Big shout out to <a title=\"Riot Grrrl Berlin
    Compilations\"
    href=\"http:\/\/riotgrrrlberlin.tumblr.com\/grrrlcompilations\"
    target=\"_blank\">Riot Grrrl Berlin<\/a> and their fantastic compilations,
    on which lots of these bands feature.<\/p>\n

        The first band I found was an anarchafeminist outfit from Nepal called
        <a title=\"Tank Girl\"
        href=\"http:\/\/kasamaproject.org\/2010\/04\/14\/tank-girl-anarcha-feminist-punk-from-nepal\/\"
        target=\"_blank\"><strong
          >Tank Girl<\/strong><\/a>. Nepal has a deeply traditional patriarchal
          society; marital rape was outlawed only in 2006 and still carries just
          a six month sentence. Rape survivors are often ostracised, having
          &#8216;brought shame&#8217; to their family and wider community. Dalit
          (or &#8216;low-caste&#8217;) women face additional discrimination and
          extremely high levels of violence.<\/p>\n
          <p>
            One of Tank Girl&#8217;s members, Sareena Rai, is involved in two
            other feminist DIY punk bands, <a title=\"Rai Ko Ris\"

            to protect themselves from gender-based violence, delivering
