          Yet this word \u2013 simultaneously standing in for itself and
          existing as an independent unit of meaning \u2013 is possibly one of
          the most widely-used symbols of all.\u00a0How exactly this might be
          relevant to a consideration of feminism will be herein considered, but
          I hope my indulgent readers will excuse a slightly cheeky use of
          theoretical thinking. We all know each other well enough by now,
          don&#8217;t we?<\/p>\n

            The most straightforward significance of X is, as Latin-fans will
            know, &#8216;ten&#8217; \/ &#8217;10&#8217; (I, II, III, IV, V, VI,
            VII, VIII, IX, X). Two tens side by side is\u00a0<em
              >XX<\/em>, or\u00a0twenty \/ 20.\u00a0How many tens can you think
              of? Ten lost tribes of Israel, ten commandments, ten plagues of
              Egypt, ten dimes in a dollar, ten years in a decade. It&#8217;s a
              pleasingly round number, and an easy times table, even if it
              frequently loses out to &#8216;twelve&#8217; \/ &#8217;12&#8217;
              in mystic significance.<\/p>\n

                But\u00a0<em
                  >x <\/em>is not simply a linguistic unit: it is also a visual
                  one. Two diagonal lines; two Vs touching each other; a
                  crossover; a cross; a cross-roads. Like &#8216;0&#8217;, which
                  means &#8216;oh&#8217;, &#8216;o&#8217;, &#8216;zero&#8217;
                  and &#8216;nothing&#8217;, it represents one of its meanings
                  aesthetically: it is a
                  <em
                    >cross. <\/em>Thus\u00a0King&#8217;s X and <a

                      but, perhaps because of its relationship to the Greek

                          >X-mas<\/em>&#8216;), although it actually looks more
                          like the St. Andrew cross, which makes up the Scottish

                                    rather than a pluralised one. Here too, we
                                    bump into a common significance
