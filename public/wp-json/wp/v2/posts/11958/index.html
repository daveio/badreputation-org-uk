  Whilst looking for something to put on in the background during a washing up
  marathon the other day, I stumbled across a 1985 Disney film called <a
  href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Journey_of_Natty_Gann\"><strong
    >The Journey of Natty Gann<\/strong><\/a>. Set during the Depression of the
    1930s, it&#8217;s an &#8211; inevitably &#8211; heartwarming story of a
    teenage tomboy who gets separated from &#8211; also inevitably &#8211; her
    dad, but is befriended by \u2013 sigh \u2013 a wolf.<\/p>\n
    <h3>
      Who is Natty Gann?<\/h3>\n
      <p>
        I&#8217;d never heard of the film before &#8211; do any of you remember
        it? Anyway, here&#8217;s the trailer: watch out for a super young John
        Cusack! (I admit that played a part in my decision to watch it. That and
        the trains.)<\/p>\n

      </p>
      <p>
        Also, someone should tell Natty that her dad is actually Leland
        Palmer.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <h3>
        A few more feminist points for Disney<\/h3>\n
        <p>
          The film stars a young Meredith Salenger as Natty, whose understated
          performance undercuts many of the more saccharine moments of the film.
          She comes across as tough rather than &#8216;feisty&#8217;, which is a
          rare treat.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_11981\" style=\"width: 244px\"

        <p>
          Although all Natty&#8217;s major relationships are with male
          characters (she has the Disney missing mother syndrome) so it
          definitely doesn&#8217;t pass Bechdel, I think the film gets feminist
          points in other places. Mostly because the lead protagonist, Natty, is
          so kickass. She&#8217;s smart, brave and resourceful. It&#8217;s a
          proper adventure \u2013 there&#8217;s an epic journey, friends and
          foes, and very real danger. She escapes various shades of
          train-related death as she rides the rails to find her father, and she
          also escapes an orphanage-prison and a sexual assault. She does
          <em
            >loads<\/em> of running.<\/p>\n
            <p>
              Natty&#8217;s also a tomboy and crucially doesn&#8217;t get made
              over into a &#8220;Proper Girl&#8221; at any point. My favourite
              thing is that no one seems to care that she&#8217;s dressed like a
              boy &#8211; no one ever mentions it or makes a derogatory comment
              about it. And she pulls John Cusack while wearing shirt, trews,
              boots and a flat cap. Love it!<\/p>\n

              No women wanderers?<\/h3>\n

                Another part of this film&#8217;s feminist cred is its rare
                depiction of a female hobo. From <a
                href=\"http:\/\/memory.loc.gov\/ammem\/wwghtml\/wwgessay.html\">Woody
                Guthrie<\/a> to <a
                href=\"http:\/\/www.hermitary.com\/lore\/kerouac.html\">Kerouac<\/a>
                to <a href=\"http:\/\/youtu.be\/tYGCpGzFWh0\"><strong
                  >Big Rock Candy Mountain<\/strong><\/a>, the figure of the <a
                  href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hobo\">hobo<\/a> is as
                  much a part of US cultural identity as the cowboy. Both ways
                  of living were at best hard and at worst brutal and
                  dehumanising but have been romanticized and over the years
                  have passed into folklore. And like cowboys, maybe even more
                  so, hobos are almost exclusively imagined and represented as
                  being male.<\/p>\n
                  <p>
                    Perhaps the greatest lesson that has come from the active
                    study of the history of marginalised social groups is that
                    even where it&#8217;s not recorded that they were there,
                    they were. Ethnic minorities, women, refugees, people with
                    disabilities, people with a dazzling range of sexual
                    orientations, gender identities and expressions&#8230; no
                    group just popped into being in the 1980s. So hopefully it
                    will come as no surprise that there were women hobos, and
                    plenty of them.<\/p>\n
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In January 1934&#8217;s US census, nearly 14,500 women were
                    recorded as homeless or transient, nearly 2,783 of them
                    under 21. A 1906 estimate put the total hobo population of
                    the US at 500,000, but numbers increased dramatically during
                    the Great Depression as homelessness spiralled to an
                    estimated two million.<\/p>\n
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There are a few firsthand accounts from women hobos, such as
                    this one from <a
                    href=\"http:\/\/erroluys.com\/NormaDarrah.htm\">Norma
                    Darrah<\/a>. The most famous record comes from
                    &#8216;Boxcar&#8217; Bertha Thompson, although it was later
                    revealed that her autobiography, <a
                    href=\"http:\/\/www.bookslut.com\/fiction\/2002_11_000416.php\"><strong
                      >Sister of the Road<\/strong><\/a>, was a fictionalized
                      account stitched together from the experiences of several
                      different women. Rather unbelievably, the story inspired
                      Martin Scorsese and producer Roger Corman to make a
                      ridiculous hobo-themed sexploitation flick:<\/p>\n

                        Riding the rails of patriarchy<\/h3>\n
                        <p>
                          Like Natty, many women and girls who were wandering
                          would dress as men, for comfort and camaraderie but
                          also for protection since &#8211; like homeless women
                          today &#8211; they were especially vulnerable to
                          sexual violence. Many hobo women had transactional sex
                          to help secure food, money and passage.<\/p>\n
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Perhaps it&#8217;s this detail in particular which has
                          helped to shut the female hobo out of the golden halls
                          of myth and folklore. The reality of many
                          women&#8217;s experiences was harder to romanticize
                          than that of their male counterparts, and the fact
                          that many were sexually exploited undermined the
                          charming hobo &#8216;<a title=\"Hobo ethical code\"

                          chums gender stereotypes and double standards &#8211;

                          The urge to roam, the &#8216;wanderlust&#8217; which
                          is so highly prized in narratives of American
                          identity, is usually held to be incompatible with
                          femininity or femaleness. Where a man who roams and
                          values his independence is admired, the same traits in
                          a woman are often characterised as fickleness or
                          infidelity.<\/p>\n

                        <p>
                          In a culture and at a time when women were
                          inextricably linked to the private sphere of
                          domesticity, and were called upon &#8211;
                          imaginatively or actually &#8211; to represent and
                          defend &#8216;home sweet home&#8217;, the homeless
                          female wanderer is an unsettling figure. She has
                          rejected her assigned role and slipped into the great
                          blue yonder, claiming her right to agency and mobility
                          despite the cost.<\/p>\n
