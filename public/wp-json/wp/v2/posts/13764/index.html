  Welcome to the latest in my scattered series on &#8216;comics wot I love which
  are a bit feminist&#8217; (previous posts include <a

          Love. And. Rockets.<\/h3>\n
          <p>
            If you&#8217;re at all interested in comics or graphic novels
            you&#8217;ve probably heard of <a
            href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Love_and_Rockets_(comics)\"><strong
              >Love &amp; Rockets<\/strong><\/a>, and you&#8217;ve probably had
              someone like me tell you about how amazing it is and how you
              should read it immediately. I&#8217;ll try not to labour the
              point, but it is really, really worth having a look.<\/p>\n
              <p>
                The scope of the series, which ran from 1981-1996 &#8211; with
                further stories being added since 2001 &#8211; can be a bit
                daunting, which is why Fantagraphics have produced a guide to <a
                href=\"http:\/\/www.fantagraphics.com\/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=76&amp;Itemid=135\">how
                to read
                <strong
                  >Love &amp; Rockets<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n
                  <p>
                    In brief: the
                    <strong
                      >Love &amp; Rockets<\/strong> title encompasses two
                      separate but slenderly-connected worlds, with Gilbert
                      Hernandez writing about the fictional Central American
                      village Palomar and its inhabitants, and brother Jaime
                      Hernandez writing about the adventures of two
                      <em
                        >punkeras<\/em> in 1980s California.<\/p>\n
                        <p>
                          Both sets of stories span decades, with meandering
                          plots, sprawling casts, and for my money, the
                          emotional depth and philosophical reach of any
                          &#8216;great&#8217; work of literature. There are
                          touches of magic realism, and sex and violence feature
                          prominently, although they are hardly glamourised. If
                          anything, the comics focus on the mundane, everyday
                          details of two tangles of human lives with the
                          occasional connecting thread.<\/p>\n
                        </p>

                          Women and humans<\/h3>\n

                            What makes each half of the series so compelling
                            (and they are &#8211; I have pulled more than one
                            all-nighter working my way to the end of a story
                            arc) is the incredible ability of both artists to
                            give their characters life. And more than that, to
                            make them
                            <em
                              >human<\/em>, with all the cruelty, confusion and
                              compassion that that involves. I&#8217;m trying to
                              pick my way through a bog of clich\u00e9s here,
                              but for me the Hernandez brothers are up there
                              with Shakespeare and George Eliot in their
                              characterization.<\/p>\n
                              <p>
                                And a hugely important part of that for me is
                                that both worlds have magnificent, believable,
                                complex, varied and interesting female
                                characters. Tons and tons of them, and they get
                                plot. In fact, they get the bulk of the plot.
                                Some are &#8216;strong female characters&#8217;
                                in the most literal sense (rather than the

                                the cast includes a number of women wrestlers
                                and superheroes. That may sound ridiculous, but

                                    heavy. She is the only heavy person in

                                        While Maggie does worry a little about
                                        her weight, it never bothers her lovers,
                                        and she is not ostracised or ridiculed
                                        or any of the other things we are taught
                                        to fear may befall us if we get
                                        fat.<\/p>\n

                                        That&#8217;s something else I love about
                                        the Locas stories: they can be a good
                                        antidote to body image argh, not just
                                        because there&#8217;s a huge range of
                                        body types on show (there is a lot of
                                        nudity \u2013 again, it doesn&#8217;t
                                        tend to be glamorous) but because they
                                        are drawn with such skill and honesty
                                        that it is impossible to be
                                        ashamed.<\/p>\n

                                        And, well, the comics are sexy. Not in a
                                        brittle, cookie-cutter, performative way
                                        (although that is examined too when some

                                            he aims to treat sex just like

                                            \u201cbecause that&#8217;s how life
                                            is: you have sex, then make a

                                              At the start, the comic was in
                                              &#8216;freefall&#8217;, breaking
                                              all then rules and comic
                                              conventions, so it was about doing
                                              something different. But he
                                              explained that \u201cI knew I had
                                              to back it up \u2013 I could put
                                              in as many Latinos as I wanted
                                              because I am one, I know that

                                              between women I was aware of my
                                              responsibility to listen and
