      There wasn&#8217;t a specific comic which made me look at the female lead
      and think &#8220;<em
        >Girls can be heroes just as well as guys! I should be for equality, and
        stuff.<\/em>&#8221; That doesn&#8217;t mean there weren&#8217;t loads of
        characters who fit the bill, only that I never looked on them that way.
        Which could be the whole point&#8230;<\/p>\n
        <p>
          I got into comics pretty late, and mostly with UK releases instead of
          Marvel or DC. I think it started when an older friend had spent 2
          straight hours laughing himself onto the floor at Alan Moore and Alan
          Davis&#8217; &#8220;<a

            more of that one.) I suppose that technically DR&#8217;s girlfriend

            Chrissie<\/a> is an empowered and independent woman, but since she
            spends much of her time firing guns and\/or throttling him,
            it&#8217;s hard to tell. It&#8217;s a great book though, especially
            the incredibly sensitive war poetry.<\/p>\n<div

                in the UK. It hurt like hell when I finally stopped buying it
                (around the age of 18 and at university, I think). It also
                produced a far more relevant female character for this post:
                <strong
                  >Judge Anderson<\/strong>. I was mostly oblivious to Judge
                  Dredd&#8217;s satire on future fascism, so all I knew was that
                  Anderson was a determined, skilled woman who could do
                  everything Dredd could (shout, kick doors, shoot things) but
                  also more. She had the psi-powers side of it as well, and her
                  storylines just seemed fuller to me. The telepathy element
                  allowed for more of a detective story, and the others in
                  Psi-Division such as Empaths brought in some very murky
                  subtlety at times. There was no hint of her being less
                  physically capable than a male Judge (although Dredd in
                  particular is something of an unstoppable juggernaut) so my
                  decision was completely based on which characters I got more
                  from. (This priority of &#8216;story over gender&#8217; was
                  reflected in my affection for another

                            always feature highly. Technically very few of the
                            female characters in the Sandman tales are actually
                            human, and those in the Endless family such as
                            Death, Delirium and Despair certainly not, but it is
                            a remarkable book. There&#8217;s no question that
                            Death herself is where all the focus is, as she
                            steals the show from her brother Dream even in the
                            main Sandman storylines which are supposedly about
                            him.<\/p>\n

                                        In Rucka&#8217;s storyline however,
                                        things get shaken up a bit. Elektra has
                                        got too used to the endless killing, and
                                        is almost at a point where she
                                        can&#8217;t recover psychologically. She
                                        meets a new sensei who is the other main
                                        character of the book&#8230; an older

                                        most dangerous warrior in this story
                                        &#8211; more capable and badass than the

                                        intelligence and wisdom. The art (in the
                                        early episodes at least) is superb, with
                                        a fight between them showing convincing
                                        movement and how muscles actually work.
                                        It also heralded a change from
