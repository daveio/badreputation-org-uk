    >A final taste of different sorts of feminists, their families and the
    festive season. This one is crowdsourced using an online survey from my own
    Twitter feed and also this website. Everyone was asked the same questions
    and given room to type whatever they wanted. I&#8217;ve selected a handful
    of quotes that I thought were interesting, relevant or in certain cases just
    made me smile or feel all festive&#8230; This means they are kinda jumbled,
    but I like that as it shows the commonalities, particularly the focus on our
    families &#8211; whatever they look like!<\/em><\/p>\n

          <p>
            &#8220;I celebrate Christmas as a practising
            Christian.&#8221;<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            &#8220;I&#8217;m originally from Poland. I&#8217;m not flying home
            this year because I don&#8217;t have any days off left because of my
            studies.&#8221;<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            &#8220;I am a 23-year-old disabled feminist who lives alone in
            council housing. I am unemployed due to my disability and spend a
            lot of my time homebound.&#8221;<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            &#8220;Too much to do w\/ career\/cuts this year to get involved in
            capitalistic nonsense this year. Merry Christmas!&#8221;<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            &#8220;Spending the weekend before Solstice with partners&#8217;
            parents and the rest of the Christmas time at home.&#8221;<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            &#8220;I enjoy pink products! &#8230; But ideally, I&#8217;d like to
            be able to enjoy them were I male, too, without negative
            comment!&#8221;<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            &#8220;For various reasons we can&#8217;t get to our families, so
            we&#8217;re all doing Christmas together. We&#8217;re going to prep
            the food on Christmas Eve, then have dinner and stockings the next
            day, and generally be relaxed.&#8221;<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            &#8220;I have honestly never really considered Christmas as being
            stressful for feminists but that&#8217;s because my dad was always
            pretty involved and my partner does a lot of the
            cooking.&#8221;<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            &#8220;I bought a card for my younger brother who is currently
            working in France because I know he&#8217;s getting
            homesick.&#8221;<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            &#8220;Last year I wrote poems for the people closest to
            me.&#8221;<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            &#8220;Will probably end up at my local arts centre, buying quirky
            crap.&#8221;<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            &#8220;I guess I feel the need to try and take some pressure off my
            Mum because she always seems to get very worked up about Christmas,
            she has the longest holiday so has always done more of the
            preparation.&#8221;<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            &#8220;The way children&#8217;s toys are so aggressively segregated
            by gender worries me and I often think about how I will work this
            when and if I have children of my own.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n
