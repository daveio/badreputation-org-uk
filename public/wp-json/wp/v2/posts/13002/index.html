          I&#8217;m not a fan of stereotypical femininity, so when my sister
          decided to organise a trip to see the stage version of <a

              discover that when you get past the <a

              target=\"_blank\">frilly dresses<\/a>, there are some surprisingly
              serious and complex themes woven into the plot. By the time we
              reached the interval I had been converted, but since it can be
              difficult to find anyone to discuss intersectional feminism with
              you on a hen night pub crawl, I&#8217;ve had to save my
              observations for the internet.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              In case it&#8217;s been a while since you&#8217;ve seen the 1987
              film, here&#8217;s a quick recap of the plot: in the summer
              between high school and college, Baby spends a few weeks with her
              well-off family at a holiday resort in the Catskills, where she
              meets Penny, a working class dance instructor who has recently
              become pregnant and then been dumped.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              Penny desperately wants to have an abortion, but it&#8217;s
              illegal and therefore expensive and risky. On top of that, she
              can&#8217;t afford to take time off from her second job,
              performing at a neighbouring resort with her dance partner and
              platonic best friend Johnny.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              Baby steps in to help her, first talking her father into lending
              her the money to pay for the abortion, then learning the dance
              routine so that she can take Penny&#8217;s place on stage. In the
              process of learning to dance, she has to spend lots of time with
              sexy dance instructor Johnny, in situations which conveniently
              provide excuses for him to be wet and\/or shirtless, and they end
              up having a hot summer fling.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              Although it&#8217;s easily overlooked in favour of her romantic
              relationship with Johnny, it&#8217;s Baby&#8217;s friendship with
              Penny which sets up the film&#8217;s feminist credentials: the
              main catalyst for the plot is one woman helping another woman to
              obtain an abortion. Unlike more recent American films about
              unplanned pregnancy, such as <a
              href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0467406\/\"
              target=\"_blank\"><strong
                >Juno<\/strong><\/a> or <a
                href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0478311\/\"
                target=\"_blank\"><strong
                  >Knocked Up<\/strong><\/a>,
                  <strong
                    >Dirty Dancing<\/strong> approaches abortion from an openly
                    pro-choice perspective. At no point does Penny face any
                    moral judgement for her decision, but there&#8217;s plenty
                    of criticism for the man who abandoned her, and the
                    abortionist who charges her hundreds of dollars for a
                    procedure that leaves her seriously ill.<\/p>\n
                    <p>
                      But even before she makes her grand gesture of sisterly
                      solidarity to Penny, Baby is presented as a feminist
                      character. When she is first introduced, we learn that she
                      is about to go to college (it&#8217;s later explained that
                      she plans to study economics at a <a
                      href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mount_Holyoke_College\"
                      target=\"_blank\">prestigious women&#8217;s college<\/a>)
                      and wants to join the Peace Corps after graduating. This
                      stands in stark contrast to her sister Lisa, whose main
                      ambition appears to be finding a husband. Lisa and the
                      other female guests at the resort demonstrate the kind of
                      comfortable yet uninspiring lifestyle that Baby has
                      decided to reject in favour of having adventures and
                      trying to save the world.<\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Baby&#8217;s determination to make a difference could have
                      been presented as a straightforwardly positive trait, but
                      her ability to help Penny is closely tied to her
                      family&#8217;s wealth, and the writers use Johnny&#8217;s
                      reaction to comment on her privilege. Johnny initially
                      resents her involvement, and makes the scathing comment <a

                      Johnny begins to talk about his life and his precarious
                      employment situation, Baby looks na\u00efve and sheltered
                      in comparison, but by the end of the film she has started
                      to understand her own privilege <a

                    <p>
                      Baby&#8217;s class privilege affects the dynamic of her
                      relationship with Johnny, giving her power and agency that
                      goes against traditional gender roles. As a guest at the
                      resort, Johnny relies on Baby&#8217;s cooperation for his
                      continued employment, and he feels further indebted to her
                      because she is paying for Penny&#8217;s abortion.<\/p>\n

                    <p>
                      Baby&#8217;s background means that she&#8217;s used to
                      getting her way, so she isn&#8217;t shy about talking back
                      to Johnny during their early dance lessons, and she
                      remains assertive when they grow closer, eventually being
                      the one to <a

                    <p>
                      Women&#8217;s sexuality is a major theme in the film, and
                      it&#8217;s actually kind of refreshing to see a film
                      address women&#8217;s interest in sex without trying to
                      dress it up in a desire for True Love. There are frequent
                      nods to the female gaze, whether it&#8217;s through the
                      blatant fanservice of Patrick Swayze&#8217;s shirtless
                      scenes (set to music like <a

                        reminding the nice, respectable college boys he has
                        recruited as waiters that part of their job is to

                          Bunnies&#8221;, middle-aged women who stay at the
                          resort all summer and are only joined by their

                        <p>
                          As a coming-of-age movie, the script also touches on
                          the idea of sexual awakening, contrasting Baby&#8217;s
                          experience with her sister Lisa&#8217;s. In one very
                          brief scene (which starts at 0:50 of <a
                          href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=IIreEum_TH8\"
                          target=\"_blank\">this clip<\/a>), the two women
                          discuss when they should lose their virginity, and
                          Baby tells Lisa that it should be with &#8220;someone
                          you sort-of love&#8221;; not necessarily the person
                          you want to spend the rest of your life with, but
                          someone you like and are attracted to.<\/p>\n
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Lisa sees sex as part of a long-term plan to persuade
                          Robbie \u2013 who the viewer already knows is the
                          sleazebag that dumped Penny when he got her pregnant
                          \u2013 to marry her, while Baby, who isn&#8217;t
                          deliberately looking for a husband, ends up with the
                          better man and the more rewarding relationship. This
                          might not be much of a revelation to many real women,
                          but it&#8217;s unusual to see a chick-flick where the
                          romantic happy ending doesn&#8217;t involve marriage
                          and babies.<\/p>\n
