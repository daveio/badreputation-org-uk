    >A few snapshots of different sorts of feminists, their families and the
    festive season. I\u2019m fortunate to have lots of lovely people in my
    circle, many of whom identify as feminists and I was interested in what
    their Christmases looked like. <\/em><\/p>\n

            <p>
              I\u2019m John, 41 years old, white, middle class, single, hetero,
              male. I&#8217;m not sure if I\u2019d call myself a feminist (due
              to a number of dissenting views as to whether men can be feminists
              or not) but I have seen the fnords, am aware of the knapsack I
              carry and try not to wave my privilege in people\u2019s faces too
              much.<\/p>\n

                <p>
                  Normally it would be visiting family \u2013 either parents or
                  one of my two sisters and their families. But this year I have
                  to work Christmas Eve and the thought of public transport and
                  a suitcase on Dec. 24<sup
                    >th<\/sup> fills me with a deep horror. So I\u2019m going to
                    visit friends in London for Christmas lunch. This has meant
                    that all presents to family had to be dispatched early, so
                    I\u2019m in the enviable position of having bought all my
                    gifts with a week to go.<\/p>\n

                        <p>
                          I have one nephew and four nieces, plus presents for
                          sisters, parents and close friends. Books tend to
                          figure highly on my present buying (and receiving) and
                          Amazon makes everything easy \u2013 especially with
                          wishlists. I\u2019ve tried to stay away from
                          stereotyped presents, but it\u2019s difficult when a
                          6-year-old boy really wants a Nerf gun and his
                          5-year-old sister wants a mouse ballerina doll. With
                          my elder nieces who are in their teens, it\u2019s a
                          bit easier \u2013 I can have a conversation with them
                          more easily about what I\u2019m happy buying for them.
                          And luckily, neither of them particularly feel the
                          need to ask for stereotypical presents \u2013 this
                          year they\u2019ve received iTunes vouchers (because
                          they want to buy games for their iPod Touches) and a
                          watch\/clock that\u2019s hopefully
                          \u2018cool\u2019.<\/p>\n

                              This year it\u2019s been a combination of Amazon
                              and other internet retailers, alongside the Brick
                              Lane and Covent Garden markets. I like getting
                              people presents that either I know they want
                              (hence the joy of wishlists) or that I see and
                              think \u201cthat would be perfect for
                              \u2026\u201d. Almost everything has needed to be
                              posted, which has meant small, durable
                              presents.<\/p>\n

                                  I\u2019m feeling quite guilty about not seeing
                                  my parents, despite their reassurances that
                                  they understand and that they\u2019re okay
                                  with me not travelling up. It\u2019s something
                                  that highlights how different my life is from

                                  had already died).\u00a0 He didn\u2019t have

                                          I\u2019m aware that I\u2019m becoming
                                          the black sheep of the family. Both my
                                          sisters are married with kids;
                                          I\u2019m single, run a cabaret
                                          occasionally, and still go clubbing
                                          regularly. But that gives me a degree
                                          of freedom to challenge the way that
                                          my nieces and nephew think, in ways
                                          their parents might not want to or be
                                          able to. I\u2019ve had conversations
                                          with the elder nieces about gender
                                          specific clothing, kicked off by me
                                          mentioning that I\u2019ve worn a skirt
                                          and makeup when I\u2019ve been out
                                          clubbing, for example.<\/p>\n
