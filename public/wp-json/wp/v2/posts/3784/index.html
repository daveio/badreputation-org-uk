<p>
  A while ago I popped down to the post office to collect a large parcel. Inside
  the cardboard box, nestled amidst plastic frames more akin to Airfix than to
  heavy machinery, were around 150 separate parts that the instructions promised
  would fit together into a workable model of an internal combustion engine.
  This model would be step one in <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/category\/toolbox\/\">the great
  <em
    >Let\u2019s Rebuild an Engine! <\/em>project of 2011<\/a> in our BadRep
    household.<\/p>\n
    <p>
      I had already recruited one colleague to help with the eventual engine
      rebuild, and she would therefore be present for the assembly of the model.
      The instructions promised that a 10-year-old would be able to put this
      together with a little adult supervision. Surely that meant that two
      20-somethings should be able to manage it?<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, prior to assembly, we had to purchase a few things that did not
      come as standard in the kit. The first was batteries. The second was
      beer.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_4688\" style=\"width: 310px\"

    <p>
      Alcohol and batteries thus acquired, we put in our takeaway order and
      opened up the box. Out spilled plastic heaven. A million fiddly parts
      attached to plastic frames, with tiny numbers on the frames indicating the
      part numbers. The manual would instruct us on how to assemble it. It also
      named all the parts, so hopefully we would learn the names of at least
      some of the moving bits and pieces by the end.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Things started off pretty well. We had
      <strong
        >Top Gear<\/strong>\u2019s Africa adventure on the telly and the
        pistons\/crankshaft assembly in the cylinder block, and the pistons made
        satisfying up-down movements when you turned the crankshaft. The
        instructions said that you needed sanding paper to get the edges of the
        plastic smooth, but as we lacked sandpaper we made do with nail files,
        which seemed to do the trick. The whole thing turned so smoothly that we
        didn\u2019t even need the vegetable oil to make it work.<\/p>\n
        <p>
          \u201cThis would be even better if it was the right size,\u201d I said
          as the plastic innards were slowly swallowed up inside the
          model.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          \u201cThat would be much more satisfying,\u201d Colleague X agreed,
          trying to get the tiny screw to stay perched atop the tiny
          screwdriver, and slot the entire thing into the tiny hole on the side
          of the crankcase. \u201cThis feels more like keyhole
          surgery.\u201d<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>\u201cWhich is also important.\u201d<\/p>\n</p>
        <p>
          \u201cYes. But not the sort of thing I had in mind when I bought the
          six-pack.\u201d<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          I, too, was getting a little restless. Earlier that week I had opened
          my planner to try to book a last-minute meeting with a senior
          colleague. He, peering over my shoulder, wanted to know what
          \u201cEngine Build\u201d was referring to, and why it had so many
          exclamation marks. I attempted to explain.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          \u201cHmmm,\u201d he said, frowning. \u201cYes, interesting. But an
          engine\u2019s a big commitment. Did you think about starting with
          something a little smaller?\u201d<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          A motorcycle? Sure. Ultimately, though, I\u2019d decided on the
          engine, because I was learning to drive a car, not a bike.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          \u201cNo, not a motorcycle,\u201d he said, just as thoughtfully.
          \u201cSomething smaller. A lawnmower, maybe, or a
          hairdryer.\u201d<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          I very pointedly did NOT stab him with his own pen, but instead said
          that we were doing a model version first.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s probably for the
          best.\u201d<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyway, other than patience and tact when faced with senior people and
          their hairdryer suggestions, what did I learn from doing this little
          side-project?<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          Firstly, it\u2019s bloody cool. There\u2019s now a little engine model
          on a shelf in my living room, and if you press the little button it
          lights up and makes happy engine noises.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, the instructions may well be wrong. Try the different bits
          together until they fit. This will probably be more useful that
          memorising engine layouts.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly, the reviews and advertising for this product piss me off
          something chronic. \u201c<a title=\"Amazon review\"
          href=\"\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/Haynes-Combustion-Engine\/dp\/B0045RAJ14\/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1297713005&amp;sr=8-7\">Ideal
          for a dad and son project<\/a>,\u201d one proclaims. Well, yes, it is,
          but it\u2019s also ideal for a dad-and-daughter and mum-and-son
          project. Or mum-and-daughter. It\u2019s basically model assembly, and
          doing this with a kid (without taking over and finishing it off
          yourself) would probably take an afternoon.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourthly, the rocker arm assembly fits on top of the valves and the
          camshaft, and there\u2019s only one correct way of lining up all the
          cams on the camshaft. There is no obvious way of knowing what that way
          is without having them labelled in alphabetical order. (This may
          require a textbook. Or a mechanic.)<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, although doing the plastic model was fun, it is limited in
          several major areas. It is extremely simplified, for one thing. The
          water-pump is two bits of plastic moulded and snapped together. The
          \u2018sparkplugs\u2019 are tiny Christmas tree lights that light up
          according to the position of the crankshaft (so the position does have
          to be correct, and the wiring is a bit tricky, but it\u2019s not
          actually how a spark plug works). The dipstick is a completely
          pointless clip-on piece of plastic that looks like a Barbie accessory,
          and I still have no idea what it does (although presumably you dip it
          in things).<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_4689\" style=\"width: 310px\"

          You also get the feeling that filing tiny bits of plastic with a nail
          file is not precisely what engine maintenance is all about. (Although
          it may well involve nail files. At this stage I have no way of
          knowing.) Assembling the model did make me more familiar with a lot of
          the parts, and I think I understand the fundamentals. But it felt a
          bit\u2026 delicate. A lot of the parts were so tiny that you had to
          hold them by the tips of your fingers, and slot them into place using
          your nails. It\u2019s the same problem as following a textbook:
          it\u2019s too clean. I didn\u2019t start this wanting to stay in my
          living room, with clean fingers and a perfect working model completed
          in a couple of hours. I want something that will take months and leave
          me exhausted and exasperated and absolutely triumphant when it is in
          fact finished.<\/p>\n
