  <p>
    In American writing, there are three perfect books, which seem to speak to
    every reader and condition: &#8220;Huckleberry Finn,&#8221; &#8220;The Great
    Gatsby,&#8221; and &#8220;The Catcher in the Rye.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n

          those books are about, by, or can manage to conceal for long their
          contempt for women, and the extent to which one is about non-whites is
          at best left wincingly unexamined? &#8230; The defining characteristic
          for writing about spoiled rich white people is that it WILL NEVER
          speak to every reader in every condition. And Huck Finn may have been
          poor on paper but he exhibits the snotty certainty of his own
          awesomeness and freedom to do whatever he likes without significant
          punishment that surely speaks to the spoiled rich white bro

                    N word\u2019 are too hot to print in the modern market. <a

                      Mixed reactions to this online; even quite liberal
                      commenters find that seeing the N-word written down is Not
                      Okay today (to the point that I\u2019m not going to put it
                      here because I don&#8217;t want to bring that to this
                      site.) Others are outraged, such as Emma Caulfield (who
                      played \u2018Anya\u2019 in
                      <em

                          <p>
                            \u201cUNDERSTAND this. Mark Twain wrote HF to show
                            the absurdity of racism. He was one of the most
                            profound forward thinkers of any

                            Language is important, and in the same way that we
                            try to be deliberately inclusive in the feminist
                            arena by rejecting language which is sexist, ableist
                            or casually tolerant of any kind of bigotry, seeing
                            prejudices treated as acceptable on a page can
                            influence people. This isn&#8217;t the first time
                            the work has been censored &#8211; CBS made a tv
                            version in 1955 which cut out
                            <em

                              <p>
                                I\u2019m with Emma on this though: if
                                you\u2019re too young to realise that Huck (or
                                Tom Sawyer) parroting the local prejudices was
                                done deliberately to reflect badly on the
                                society they were in, and their poor and
                                uneducated backgrounds, then the story itself
                                should be enough to demonstrate the inhumanity
                                of racism.<\/p>\n
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                &#8230;which isn&#8217;t to say that Twain
                                doesn&#8217;t also play unacceptably on
                                stereotypes of coloured people in the book for
                                what seems like cheap comedy value at times,
                                because he certainly does.<\/p>\n

                                I think there\u2019s a bigger opportunity here.
                                Those three books most assuredly don\u2019t
                                speak to \u201cevery reader and condition\u201d
                                \u2013 so let\u2019s find some that do!<\/p>\n

                                which you think have genuine near-universal
