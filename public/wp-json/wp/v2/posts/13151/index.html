            data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/a>One of the things about being a fan
            of all things zombie is that on a regular basis I come across
            articles declaring the end of the &#8216;zombie craze&#8217;, saying
            that all the stories about zombies have been told, that the genre is
            exhausted. These articles will usually involve puns.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            It\u2019s an argument that essentially misses the point of how both
            people and stories work &#8211; we don\u2019t tell a story and then
            move onto the next one, we tell the same story over and over, from
            every possible angle, trying to tease out something new or
            rediscovered each time. One of the reasons I love zombie movies is
            they\u2019re full of opportunities for that.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            But that said, there is one zombie story that I have yet to see told
            anywhere (and if it has, and I missed it, please tell me. I wanna
            see). Particularly, it involves a group of people that zombie movies
            have led me to believe could make up as much as a third of the
            global population &#8211; women.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            Zombie movies have, on the whole, managed to avoid most of the
            standard horror movie tropes when it comes to women. The amount of
            alcohol and sex a woman enjoys doesn\u2019t usually directly
            correlate with their survival chances. Chase scenes rarely take
            place while female zombie fighters are in their underwear.<\/p>\n

            1968&#8217;s
            <strong
              >Night of the Living Dead<\/strong> did star a woman (Judith
              O&#8217;Dea, right) who switched between being hysterical or
              catatonic, and another who gladly let herself get stabbed to death
              by her own daughter, because that\u2019s what good mothers do.
              There was another woman in that film as well, but nobody ever
              remembers either her or her boyfriend, so we can safely ignore
              them. However, after that initial outing George Romero actually
              seemed to learn, and the way women in zombie movies are portrayed
              generally has improved as a result.<\/p>\n
              <p>
                By 1978, and
                <strong
                  >Dawn of the Dead,<\/strong> the main female character (Gaylen
                  Ross&#8217;s Francine) may have found herself in the role of
                  \u201chouse mom\u201d, and not just because she was pregnant.
                  But she fought against that role, insisting that the others
                  teach her how to fire a gun and fly the escape helicopter,
                  skills which led to her being the movie\u2019s only
                  survivor.<\/p>\n

                    <strong
                      >Day of the Dead<\/strong> (1985) had only one female
                      character, but Sarah (Lori Cardille) was also very much
                      the brains of the film, a badass, level headed under
                      pressure, and again, one of the three characters to make
                      it through the film.<\/p>\n

                        <strong
                          >Night of the Living Dead<\/strong> was remade by
                          Romero in 1990, Barbra, our alternately
                          catatonic\/screaming heroine from the first film, was
                          now &#8211; played by Patricia Tallman &#8211; also a
                          badass who knew her way around a firearm.<\/p>\n

                                        You see, zombie movies come in many
                                        different flavours. They can be war
                                        movies, economic parables, satire, or an
                                        examination of the violence inherent in
                                        human nature. They can even, with their
                                        \u201cbunch of people locked in a
                                        building together\u201d format, be a
                                        sitcom. But in most cases, one thing you
                                        see a lot of in zombie movies is wish
                                        fulfilment.<\/p>\n

                                        It\u2019s the reason why so many
                                        perfectly sensible, realistic people
                                        have more detailed plans for a zombie
                                        apocalypse than they do for a fire
                                        breaking out in their home. There\u2019s
