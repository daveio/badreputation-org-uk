<p>
  Recently I\u2019ve had a few sharp bouts of insomnia, and found myself up at
  3am scouring my shelves for the just-right thing to read myself away from
  worry and into sleep. What I settled on was one of Margo Lanagan&#8217;s short
  story collections, <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.abebooks.co.uk\/9781741146578\/Red-Spikes-Lanagan-Margo-1741146577\/plp\"
  target=\"_blank\"><strong
    >Red Spikes<\/strong><\/a>. Lanagan is said to write fantasy fiction for
    young adults, but her stories are totally unlike anything else I&#8217;ve
    read in either of those categories, and in the overlap.<\/p>\n
    <h3>
      Weird tales, well told<\/h3>\n
      <p>
        For one thing, her stories are more original, imaginative and
        accomplished than much of what is served up to young fantasy readers.
        The reason I reached for
        <strong
          >Red Spikes<\/strong> a few nights ago is because I wanted to be
          transported. I wanted a way out of my worries, and in her short
          stories Lanagan places you in an (often unnervingly) immediate, vivid
          and visceral other place.<a

            She&#8217;s economical with the detail she gives you, winding her
            descriptions around dialogue or a protagonist&#8217;s thoughts
            rather than self-consciously setting the scene. The situations and
            societies she presents feel solid, brutally so at times, without you
            needing to be told what colour the sky is. The story is about the
            situation, not the setting, if you see what I mean.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            And those situations are genuinely unusual, strange and surprising.
            You can set your story on the third moon of Azkablam and still make
            it clich\u00e9d, formulaic and dull as ditchwater (famed for its
            dullness). In
            <strong
              >Red Spikes<\/strong> and another collection,
              <strong
                >Black Juice<\/strong>, a girl watches her sister killed in a
                tar-pit as punishment for murdering her husband, while elsewhere
                in a circus-y dystopia two anti-clown vigilantes carry out a
                hit. A girl in a paper dress graduates from Bride School, and a
                boy finds some tiny figures of a bear and a heavily pregnant
                armoured queen who grow and come to life in the night.
                Naturally, he is enlisted as midwife.<\/p>\n

                  Lanagan\u2019s stories are bizarre, and even when you\u2019re
                  in more familiar terrain they\u2019re often told from an
                  unusual point of view. In <a

                      outcast, treated as a monster herself, who saves the life
                      of the boy she loves only to be rejected. However, UNLIKE
                      the Little Mermaid, she doesn\u2019t wimpily dissolve into
                      seafoam, but sees him for the coward he is and strides

                        These synopses have probably given you a clue that as
                        well as being strange, Lanagan\u2019s stories are often
                        pretty dark. And if you think Harry Potter is

                              sexually assault her. Liga despairs, takes her
                              baby daughter to a ravine in the forest and tries
                              to kill them both, but they are magically saved

                              It seems to be a heaven that Liga has created to
                              protect herself and her daughters (she has another
                              baby). But as her daughter grows up the membrane
                              between their protected world and the world Liga
                              left behind starts to grow thin, and the story
                              becomes a reimagining of the traditional fairytale

                                      to deliver a very oppressive message to
                                      girls and women: At all costs, however
                                      beastly your menfolk&#8217;s behaviour,

                                      come to their aid. This kind of message is
                                      not uncommon in the collections of
                                      transcribed and revised folktales of the
                                      18th and 19th century, and it&#8217;s

                                        seems to be interested in the rawer,
                                        messier, less moral incarnations of our
                                        familiar fairytales, but where they
                                        differ is that Lanagan\u2019s story
                                        fully inhabits the folkloric style where
                                        Carter\u2019s versions are

                                              with women\u2019s sexuality and
