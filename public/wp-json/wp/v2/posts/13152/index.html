  This Mission Statement is taken from the <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.womeninhorrormonth.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Women in
  Horror Recognition Month website<\/a>. They&#8217;ve asked that it be shared,
  quoted and spread about as much as possible, so we&#8217;re giving it the
  spotlight in itself for a moment, before we get down with our horror-nerdy
  selves in these pages. <\/p>\n

<h2>
  The Mission<\/h2>\n
  <p>
    Women in Horror Recognition Month (WiHM) assists underrepresented female
    genre artists in gaining opportunities, exposure, and education through
    altruistic events, printed material, articles, interviews, and online
    support. WiHM seeks to expose and break down social constructs and
    miscommunication between female professionals while simultaneously educating
    the public about discrimination and how they can assist the female gender in
    reaching equality.<\/p>\n
  </p>
  <h2>
    The Vision<\/h2>\n
    <p>
      A world in which all individuals are equally given the opportunity to
      create, share, and exploit their concept of life, pain, and freedom of
      expression.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <h3>
      IT\u2019S THE YEAR 2012, NOT THE 1950s. IS THERE REALLY A NEED FOR
      WiHM?<\/h3>\n
      <p>
        Absolutely. Otherwise, WiHM would not exist. Women are still not offered
        the same pay and opportunities as their male colleagues in many
        industries, particularly the arts. Discrimination runs rampant in
        Hollywood and it&#8217;s very difficult for females (even well-known
        actresses) to get their films funded by major studios. <\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        Statistics prove that women are still not offered the same opportunities
        as men due to an array of reasons, from discrimination to female
        professionals accepting less than they are worth in order to receive the
        same opportunities as their male colleagues.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        In other parts of the world, women are still stoned to death for
        speaking their minds, excommunicated when they are sexually violated,
        and not offered proper education. Atrocities continue to happen that
        force the female gender to be subservient to a patriarchal system that
        tells them how to dress, who to marry, and what they should do with
        their lives. All discrimination must be exposed and obliterated for the
        female gender to truly achieve equality.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        WiHM focuses on supporting the achievements of women who utilize the
        most extreme mirror available in storytelling: horror. We encourage
        women to explore and represent these horrors constructively, in positive
        environments.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <h3>
        WHAT ARE THE INDUSTRY\u2019S STATISTICS?<\/h3>\n
        <ul>
          \n
          <li>
            In the 1920s there were no more than 10 women working in Hollywood
            in leadership positions.<\/li>\n
          </li>
          <li>
            In 2009, the mainstream film industry\u2019s ratio was 16% women to
            84% men.<\/li>\n
          </li>
          <li>
            In 2011, women made up only 5% of directors working in
            Hollywood.<\/li>\n
            <h3>
              SO WiHM IS ALL ABOUT WOMEN. WHAT ABOUT MEN?<\/h3>\n
              <p>
                WiHM was created with no exclusion. Men play a vital part in the
                female gender reaching equality. There are many male WiHM
                Ambassadors and artists who choose to assist and work with
                professional and talented underrepresented female practitioners.
                Be a guiding example of a man who respects both genders
                equally.<sup

                              Education is essential. Knowledge is power.
                              Understanding history and where that puts us
                              today, politically and socially, demonstrates how
                              we are interpreting each other and
                              ourselves.<\/p>\n

                                  Finding professional women to work with in
                                  leadership positions is one of the most
                                  important actions you can take to assist the
                                  movement. Don\u2019t just work with a woman
                                  because of her gender, work with her because
                                  she has a lot to bring to the table.<\/p>\n

                                          charity events (blood drives, film
                                          screenings, art shows), write blogs
                                          and articles, conduct interviews, and
                                          create videos and podcasts for mass
