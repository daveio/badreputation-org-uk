            Picture the linguistic landscape of the thirteenth century. Full of
            bastard Latin, Anglo-Norman, smatterings of Anglo-Saxon crudities,
            and a few words whose origins nobody knows. Sometime around 1290,
            the word
            <em
              >girl <\/em>appeared, used to signify \u2018a child or young
              person of either sex\u2019, alongside clarifying compounds
              <em
                >knave girl <\/em>and
                <em
                  >gay girl <\/em>(\u2018boy\u2019 and, er, \u2018girl\u2019
                  respectively). Like some tantalisingly similar words &#8211;
                  <em
                    >lad, lass, boy <\/em>&#8211; its provenance is unclear,
                    although some cunning linguists would have it derive
                    ultimately (via some torturous and dark history) from the
                    Greek &#8216;parthenos&#8217; (=&#8217;virgin&#8217;). But
                    yes, uh huh, you read right: in its earliest incarnation,
                    <em
                      >girl <\/em>was ungendered. In fact, it was not until the
                      1530s that its more specific application to XX chromosomes
                      surfaced, with
                      <em
                        >girl <\/em>meaning \u2018a female child\u2019 &#8211;
                        and even then, it still had its enduring reference to
                        &#8216;a roebuck in its second year&#8217;, with roe<em
                          >buck<\/em> being, naturally, the male equivalent of
                          <em
                            >roe<\/em> (a deer, a female deer).<\/p>\n

                                a roebuck, a roedeer, and, perhaps a (male)
                                girl. Not actually that uncommon: after all, we

                                  although in his case there were excellent
                                  practical reasons for the switchover (lol
                                  revolution). There is also James

                                    This could speak of a reluctance to bother
                                    gendering the child until that gender could
                                    be of socio-political relevance (something
                                    infant mortality could only have
                                    encouraged), but that is not to say it went
                                    un-bemoaned by the children themselves. The
                                    poet Rainer Maria Rilke complained bitterly
                                    of his mother&#8217;s reign of sartorial
                                    terror: &#8216;I had to wear beautiful long
                                    dresses, and until I started school I went
                                    about like a little girl. I think my mother
