        <a href=\"http:\/\/www.maryseacole.com\"><strong
          >Mary Jane Seacole<\/strong><\/a> is perhaps somewhat better known
          than most of those appearing in this series, having been included in
          Britain\u2019s National Curriculum and featured on postage stamps as
          part of the National Portrait Gallery\u2019s 150<sup
            >th<\/sup> anniversary. Despite this she stands as a perfect example
            of the sort of person we\u2019re interested in here: one who went to
            extraordinary lengths to achieve their goals, facing risks and
            giving freely of their time and energy, yet without becoming a
            household name associated with awesomeness. In Seacole\u2019s case
            this was primarily due to the fact that she&#8217;s been
            overshadowed in popular consciousness by the similarly impressive <a
            href=\"http:\/\/www.florence-nightingale.co.uk\"><strong
              >Florence Nightingale<\/strong><\/a>. So, let\u2019s look back to
              the 19<sup
                >th<\/sup> century and find out a little about the Crimean
                War\u2019s other famous nurse.<\/p>\n
                <p>
                  Born in Kingston, Jamaica in 1805, Seacole was exposed to
                  medicine from an early age. Her mother was a
                  \u2018doctress\u2019, using Caribbean herbal remedies to treat
                  diseases &#8211; chiefly the yellow fever that was endemic in
                  Jamaica at the time &#8211; and Seacole followed in her
                  footsteps. Travels throughout the Caribbean and Central
                  America gave her the chance to broaden her knowledge of herbal
                  treatments, and even to perform an autopsy on a victim of
                  cholera in Panama, an experience she described as
                  \u201cdecidedly useful\u201d.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  Cholera, along with yellow fever, was one of the biggest
                  sources of patients throughout Seacole\u2019s career. An
                  outbreak hit Kingston in 1850, killing over 30,000 Jamaican
                  people, and Seacole played a role in stopping the death toll
                  from rising higher still. She would battle a cholera epidemic
                  again in 1851 whilst visiting Panama, and a yellow fever
                  outbreak upon returning to Jamaica in 1853. During this time
                  she also began treating people surgically as well as herbally,
                  helping victims of knife and gunshot wounds. Whilst her
                  obvious skills earned her a measure of respect, that respect
                  was tinged with both racial and sexual prejudices, often
                  depicting her as someone who was talented \u201cfor a
                  woman,\u201d or \u201cfor a non-white.\u201d In her
                  autobiography, she remembers an American delivering a speech
                  at a dinner in Panama, who said of her that \u201cif we could
                  bleach her by any means we would [&#8230;] and thus make her
                  acceptable in any company as she deserves to be.\u201d This
                  attitude quite rightfully incensed her.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  Unfortunately, this wasn\u2019t the last time Seacole faced
                  issues as a result of discrimination based on her gender or
                  race. The outbreak of the <a
                  href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crimean_War\">Crimean
                  War <\/a>brought with it a concurrent outbreak of disease,
                  especially cholera. Disease was soon proving more lethal to
                  troops by far than injury at the hands of the enemy, and word
                  went out about the need for trained medics. Seacole, as we
                  have established, was something of an expert on cholera by
                  this point, and set sail for Britain. She arrived carrying
                  letters of recommendation from Jamaican and Panamanian
                  doctors, and offered her services to the British Army. She was
                  denied an interview, as the British Army were not entirely
                  keen on female medics at the time.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  Conditions in the Crimea, however, forced them to reconsider,
                  with public outcry following an exposure in
                  <strong
                    >The Times<\/strong> leading them to form a nursing corps,
                    headed up by Florence Nightingale. Seacole applied to join
                    this group and was again rejected. This time, she felt, the
                    rejection was due to her race.<\/p>\n
                    <p>
                      Having run into two different strands of prejudice and
                      having had her services refused twice, did Seacole go
                      home? Did she return to Kingston, where her work would be
                      appreciated, and where her fairly successful business was
                      located? Of course not. There were people that needed
                      helping, and she was an expert in the skills that would
                      help them.<\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Seacole travelled to Crimea using her own funds,
                      presenting herself at Nightingale\u2019s hospital in
                      Scutari. Once more she was rejected. So she she did what
                      any incredibly determined badass would do: she built her
                      own hospital. She didn\u2019t have proper building
                      materials or the finances to acquire them, so she built
                      the hospital just outside Sevastopol, using salvaged
                      metal, driftwood and packing cases. Because when
                      you\u2019re awesome you don\u2019t let a little thing like
                      not having a hospital or anything but the most rudimentary
                      of construction supplies stand in the way of helping those
                      in need.<\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Seacole provided treatment for the sick during the
                      mornings, travelling out to the battlefield later in the
                      day to tend to the wounded. This was often done with the
                      battle still raging on; she would treat injured soldiers
                      from both sides whilst under fire. She reportedly asked no
                      payment for her services from those who were too poor to
                      pay, accepting money only from those who could spare it.
                      Despite this, and continuous thefts of her hospital\u2019s
                      supplies, she prospered, becoming a well-known figure
                      amongst the soldiers in Crimea, who called her
                      \u201cMother Seacole.\u201d When Sevastopol fell during
                      the autumn of 1855 she was the first woman to set foot in
                      the captured city, again bringing supplies and healing to
                      both sides.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_3590\"

                      But following the war, Seacole did not fare well. With the
                      fighting over there was no more need for her hospital, and
                      little profit to be made from selling off the supplies
                      there. Hounded by creditors, she returned to England
                      destitute, having given everything she had to provide care
                      to people who needed it. In return, the public took care
                      of her, with several prominent people donating to a fund
                      for her, encouraged by a plea from

                          Following her death in 1881 Seacole\u2019s impressive
                          actions faded from public awareness, forgotten in
                          favour of Nightingale for the larger part of a
                          century. It has only been in the last decade or two
                          that awareness and recognition of her deeds has begun
                          to resurface.<\/p>\n
