  Okay, it&#8217;s probably not a hugely shocking revelation to point out that
  stories are influenced by the social conditions surrounding their writing. As
  a general principle this is pretty obvious. However, more specific examples
  and details may be slightly less obvious, so what we&#8217;re going to do here
  is take a look at the differences in the role of female characters between
  15th and 16th century fairy tales, and the changes in society at the same
  time. Hopefully this will be both interesting and illustrative.<\/p>\n

<h3>
  Begin the B\u00e9guinage<\/h3>\n
  <p>
    In the late middle ages (and please note that I am by no means suggesting
    the late middle ages were a good time to be in, I&#8217;m just covering some
    things that would become unavailable in later centuries) there were several
    avenues by which a woman might live independently. <a
    href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/B%C3%A9guinage\">B\u00e9guinages<\/a>
    offered something akin to the male guild systems, a community by which women
    might live collectively and pursue a trade, functioning much like convents
    but without the whole &#8220;retiring from the world to pursue a life of
    spirituality&#8221; element.<\/p>\n
  </p>
  <p>
    Many small industries were dominated by female crafters at the time,
    particularly the production of votive candles, and the brewing of beer
    (which, prior to increases in production scales in the 1500s was mostly a
    home industry).<\/p>\n
  </p>
  <p>
    Lastly, at the opposite end of the scale to the beguinages, there was the
    sex industry. (This is not to suggest that
    <em
      >independent woman<\/em> meant
      <em
        >prostitute<\/em> in the late middle ages, as some people often imply.
        See above for counter-examples.) Disclaimers aside, municipally
        sanctioned prostitution was both common and acceptable in the latter
        part of the 15th century, and provided one route to an independent
        life.<\/p>\n

            &#8230;the courtesan was not a phenomenon on the margin of society,
            but one of its essential components&#8230; and constituted an
            important stage in the diversification of social roles and of
            labour.<\/p>\n

                By the mid-16th century, much of this had changed. Economic
                conditions had all but eradicated the b\u00e9guinage; the
                production of goods had switched to a male-dominated large scale
                industry; the rise of Protestantism had seen the closure of many
                convents; and socially acceptable sex-work was done away with by
                changing religious mores and the increasing prevalence of
                syphilis (the &#8220;French evil&#8221;) and other STDs as
                public health threats from 1493 onwards. The Renaissance may
                have improved overall quality of life, but in many ways it
                proved a step backwards for the opportunities of Western
                European women.<\/p>\n

                Meanwhile, in the world of fiction&#8230;<\/h3>\n
                <p>
                  So, that&#8217;s how society changed; what do we see happening
                  in fiction over the same time period? In pre-16th century work
                  we find heroines taking on roles the Grimms would later depict
                  as &#8220;bad for a girl but bold for a boy&#8221;. We see, in
                  an early Catalan variant of <a
                  href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Water_of_Life_%28German_fairy_tale%29\"><strong
                    >The Waters of Life<\/strong><\/a>, an adventurous princess
                    succeeding where here brothers have failed, winning out
                    through bravery and compassion to restore her home. In the

                    of France and Italy we see female characters taking the lead
                    in stories that range from the bawdy to the obscene, which
                    reflect the assumption that of course women will sometimes
                    take the initiative.<br \ />\nEven moving away from the
                    fantastic and magical tales we find similar
                    characterisations in more serious works such as that of
                    Madonna Lisetta in Boccaccio&#8217;s

                        the characters were beginning to take the forms that
                        would be most recognisable to most modern readers. Here
                        we see the shift from the active, protagonistic female
                        character to the passive, receptive object to whom fairy
                        tales happen.<\/p>\n

                      <p>
                        Straparola&#8217;s magic tales, dating to 1553, deliver
                        a mixed message on sex and gender. The older tales in
                        the collection stay fairly true to their roots, but the
                        newer ones show female characters who must fear men, who
                        must fear the consequences of associating with them. No
                        longer do they take the lead, instead they are there to
                        be won, as with the story of three brothers who rescue a
                        princess and fall to arguing over who should wed her.
                        She doesn&#8217;t get a say in the matter.<\/p>\n
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        If Straparola&#8217;s collection shows the transition,
                        Giambattista Basile&#8217;s
                        <strong
                          >Pentamerone<\/strong> (1636) gives us the conclusion.
                          By this point all the stories reflect the new order of
                          things. Female characters are there now almost
                          entirely to receive the actions of the male leads,
                          without much choice in things themselves. A large
                          portion of Basile&#8217;s tales revolve around
                          unwanted and involuntary pregnancies. This tone
                          continues all the way through to at least the early
                          19th century, and provides the link to the next point
                          of this post.<\/p>\n

                            <p>
                              Right, this next bit is somewhat more speculative:
                              There is some research suggesting that up until
                              around the start of the 16th century women had a
                              good deal of control over their fertility (check
                              the further reading section at the end here for
                              more details). Between 1500 and 1700 this ability
                              substantially declined, leaving women far more
                              susceptible to the consequences of sex. We can
                              suggest a few reasons for this decline: Firstly,
                              there was the publication of the <a
                              href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Malleus_Maleficarum\"><strong
                                >Malleus Maleficarum<\/strong><\/a> in 1487,
                                which branded midwifes who provided
                                abortifacients as witches, and lead to
                                witch-hunt panics through Western Europe. At the
                                same time there was the rising tension caused by
                                the Protestant Reformation, which saw increased
                                conflict between Reformers and
                                Counter-Reformers, and lead to both the
                                Protestant and Catholic churches being
                                increasingly zealous in order to demonstrate
                                their own faithfulness.<\/p>\n
                                <p>
                                  There are arguments (see particularly Ruth
                                  Bottigheimer&#8217;s essay

                                    bound together. The real dangers of sex
                                    became the over-arching dangers of the

                                    the kidnappings, captivity, and general
                                    disempowerment. Thus the tales of the
