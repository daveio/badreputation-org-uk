  We&#8217;re a diverse bunch here at BadRep towers, and sometimes we
  don&#8217;t agree. When that happens, we sometimes offer a second opinion from
  another of the team. Sarah C <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/2011\/07\/04\/bookworm-caitlin-moran-how-to-be-a-woman\/\">reviewed
  Caitlin Moran&#8217;s book for us last month<\/a> &#8211; with one or two
  exceptions, she thought it was brilliant. For contrast, here is my
  review:<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s BRILLIANT.<\/p>\n</p>
<p>
  Sarah C lent me
  <strong
    >How To Be A Woman<\/strong>, Caitlin Moran&#8217;s recent feminism
    handbook\/memoir, and I expected to like it. I follow Moran <a
    href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/caitlinmoran\">on twitter<\/a> where
    she&#8217;s always deeply funny, and I thought this would be an enjoyable
    read even if it&#8217;s just her personal take on the issues. What surprised
    me is how incredibly effective the book is &#8211; and how it does some
    things which are amazing from a male point of view.<\/p>\n
    <p>
      Of course, cis male points of view aren&#8217;t automatically important in
      feminism (with some arguing that they have no place in it at all). When it
      comes to deciding what women want their future to be, and what they feel
      is harmful or unacceptable to that, men don&#8217;t really need to be part
      of the process. And most male feminists that I know understand
      that.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      However, when it comes to
      <em
        >implementing<\/em> feminism against the status quo of patriarchal
        bullshit, when women are fighting for their rights from one direction it
        helps if men are on board too. If men feel threatened by coming changes,
        they&#8217;re more likely to do the kind of heinous, disgusting, and
        frequently violent things that we see thrown back at women who challenge
        anything the patriarchy is currently comfortable with.<\/p>\n
        <p>
          Which is why I think that Caitlin Moran&#8217;s book should be
          compulsory reading for
          <em
            >boys<\/em>.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_6812\" style=\"width:

              Moran does two things which are absolutely crucial. She actively
              calls bullshit on the many forms of misogyny which have somehow
              become acceptable in society, and then she
              <em
                >laughs<\/em> at them.<\/p>\n
                <p>
                  Calling bullshit is not a small thing. It takes incredible
                  strength to say &#8220;no&#8221; to Hollywood, magazines,
                  posters, tv and the expectations of your friends, family,
                  colleagues and boss. By being brutally honest about becoming a
                  woman &#8211; periods, body hair, boobs, everything about a
                  teenager&#8217;s brain &#8211; she humanises it and makes it
                  possible to go against expectations. Of COURSE the idea that
                  every single woman needs a Brazilian shave by default is
                  stupid bullshit. Step back a moment and compare it to real
                  life as she does, and it becomes easy to laugh&#8230; and more
                  importantly to finish laughing and shout HELL NO.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em
                    >Boys will read this.<\/em> They want to know what girls
                    think, and what the changes happening to girls&#8217; bodies
                    and minds are actually like. The book is full of comedy but
                    also danger, which keeps it exciting and holds your
                    attention. I&#8217;m always going on about how pop culture
                    is great because it engages people and slips messages past
                    them while they&#8217;re having fun &#8211; this does
                    exactly that, really well.<\/p>\n
                    <p>
                      Importantly, when talking to the male side of the
                      equation, it also demystifies. Male readers can look at
                      the stupidity of some conventions, see what the reality is
                      for women and it will become easier for them to realise
                      where the bullshit lies.<\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Moran speaks directly to men in the book as well as women.
                      After telling female readers to say the words &#8220;I am
                      a feminist&#8221; out loud, possibly while standing on a
                      chair (&#8220;<em
                        >Say it. SAY IT. SAY IT NOW! Because if you can&#8217;t,
                        you&#8217;re basically bending over saying &#8216;Kick
                        my arse and take my vote, please, the
                        patriarchy.&#8217;<\/em>&#8220;) she adds this:<\/p>\n
                        <blockquote>
                          <p>
                            &#8220;And do not think you shouldn&#8217;t be
                            standing on that chair, shouting &#8216;I AM A
                            FEMINIST!&#8217; if you are a boy. A male feminist
                            is one of the most glorious end-products of
                            evolution. A male feminist should ABSOLUTELY be on
                            the chair &#8211; so we ladies may all toast you, in
                            champagne, before coveting your body
                            wildly.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n

                            Note to men: this is relatively true. Identifying as
                            a feminist in actions as well as words (unless
                            you&#8217;re a lying weasel who is just doing it to
                            get into their knickers) will by itself put you
                            quite far into the &#8220;not a raging
                            asshole&#8221; category. That&#8217;s hot. I&#8217;m
                            just saying.<\/p>\n
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            I agree with Sarah on the minor disappointments. The
                            author&#8217;s use of &#8220;retard&#8221; on page 5
                            really jars and stands out, just plain doesn&#8217;t
                            work, and isn&#8217;t okay. Where Sarah found it
                            limiting that the events are focused only on
                            Moran&#8217;s personal experiences, though, I
                            didn&#8217;t think this mattered as much to the
                            message. Where Caitlin says she doesn&#8217;t feel
                            that the word &#8220;boobs&#8221; really describes
                            any part of her body (and &#8220;breasts&#8221; is
                            worse), I know some women who feel comfortable with
                            that word &#8211; but her final decision
                            doesn&#8217;t seem as crucial as long as the reader
                            is made aware that girls face the situation of
                            having to find the right words for themselves.
                            Making everyone ask themselves the question means
                            the answer
                            <em

                              matter.<\/p>\n

                                There are plenty of universal truths in there.
                                The chapter where she reveals how the word
                                &#8220;fat&#8221; has basically become
                                weaponised to a greater degree than previous
                                nuclear-level playground insults, and gives
                                examples, all rings totally true. The stories of
                                her 16-year-old self veer between amusing and
                                devastating, but it just helps the reader
                                identify with the general problem. Hell, it made
                                *me* identify with it, when my 16-year-old self
                                was dangerously underweight, gangly, six-foot
                                and male.<\/p>\n

                                And that&#8217;s the secret. The reason
                                I&#8217;m excited about this book is that
                                it&#8217;s the first one I think will be hugely

                                  the average man. There are many modes of
                                  communication which just don&#8217;t work:
                                  language is important, but I think we can
                                  frequently become so removed from daily
                                  discourse in our attempts to avoid
                                  discriminatory words that we lose the audience
                                  entirely. Caitlin Moran will change male
                                  attitudes a million times more powerfully
                                  than, say, a paper by feminist academics which
                                  would only be read by feminist academics,
                                  containing newly invented language that boys
                                  barely understand and have not been convinced
