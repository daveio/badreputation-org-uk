  Dress codes (the set of \u2018rules\u2019 that govern what we wear in specific
  situations) are present in every facet of our daily lives, whether explicitly
  stated or inherently assumed. For this article, there\u2019s only one dress

  Ronald McDonald\u2019s red and yellow clown suit.<\/p><\/div>\n
</p>
<p>
  The working \u2018uniform\u2019 is ubiquitous to a huge number of professions,
  despite the possibility that many of us associate it first and foremost with
  the service industries. By service industries, I don\u2019t mean simply <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.yumsugar.com\/New-McDonalds-Uniforms-Love-Hate-1578851\">McDonald\u2019s
  workers<\/a>, Tesco employees or the like; service means serving you (the
  consumer) through labour. Retail fashion workers are a prime example, where
  the \u2018uniform\u2019 may not be a classic sweatshirt-and-trousers combo,
  but rather items picked solely from the collection of garments that the shop
  provides \u2013 living mannequins, in a sense. But this is getting way ahead
  of myself; let\u2019s go back a bit.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  Wearing a uniform, as so many <a
  href=\"http:\/\/debatemate.wordpress.com\/2010\/11\/19\/this-house-would-ban-school-uniforms\/\">sixth
  form debates have pointed out<\/a>, has both positive and negative effects on
  the individual and the group in any given institution. School uniform has the
  apparent benefit of making everyone equal (at least, visually) while at the
  same time ensuring creative idiosyncratic fashion choices are made in the
  smallest details; how many buttons are done up, how the tie is tied, what
  badges you wear and the jewellery you sneak in. Even in a photo that has been
  <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/environment\/green-living-blog\/2010\/aug\/23\/school-uniforms-cheap-ethical-concerns\">posed
  for this<strong>
    Guardian<\/strong> piece<\/a>, the same uniform turns up in many different
    styles. So what about the uniform at work? I\u2019ve worked in enough
    poorly-paid retail jobs to realise what the proposed function of a uniform
    is, and what actually happens when you wear it.<\/p>\n
    <p>
      Just like at school, a uniform is meant to show that all the wearers are
      equal \u2013 visually. For the consumer, workers are identified by what
      they are wearing; many a time I have been asked in various shops where the
      changing rooms are, because my particular garb is close enough to the
      \u2018uniform\u2019 of a retail fashion worker to confuse the consumer
      (although mostly this happens in charity shops. I\u2019m down with that).
      Workers are set apart from consumers and grouped together as labour
      through their uniform.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      However, looking the same and being the same are (duh) different. My
      manager and I wear the same uniform: shirt, trousers, and name badge
      \u2013 but are we the same? No. She\u2019s the
      <em
        >manager<\/em>; she\u2019s my boss. Confusing messages of similarity
        (and potential solidarity?) and hidden hierarchies abound with the
        working uniform, especially in retail sectors where more than one
        hierarchy is on the \u2018working floor\u2019. You might be able to
        argue that those industries in which workers are physically grouped by
        hierarchy \u2013 like the factory floor, where the manager is not as
        physically \u2018present\u2019 as on the shop floor \u2013 are able to
        recognise the uniform\u2019s messages of similarity and solidarity more
        effectively than those where workers of disparate hierarchies are
        bundled in together.<\/p>\n

          As well as hierarchy being hidden (but strangely elaborated too, I
          suppose, by its hiddenness), gender too, is at least under an
          attempted disguise through the wearing of uniforms. Gone are the days
          of
          <strong
            >Mad Men<\/strong>, where women wore skirts and men wore trousers
            \u2013 now we
            <em
              >all<\/em> have to wear trousers, and horrible polo shirts too. An
              apparently gender-neutral uniform is provided in a number of
              sectors (mine was previously white shirt and black trousers \u2013
              or skirt) that never really successfully disguises gender to the
              consumer in the same way that it conceals hierarchy to some
              extent. One-size-fits-all doesn\u2019t work, especially if the
              size is designed for someone who doesn\u2019t have breasts.<\/p>\n

                brings me onto those workplaces where you don\u2019t have a
                uniform. Or, at least, they don\u2019t tell you that you have a
                uniform. Explicitly, the dress code might be not much more than
                \u2018no shorts or clogs\u2019, but implicitly, the dress code
                will be bending and morphing round the individuals who are
                adhering to and working against it. This dress code will tie in
                gender and authority hierarchies, as illustrated by the business
                suit and its female equivalent.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                From my employment experience (and others who have agreed with
                me), men wear business suits, but women do not wear business
                suits, despite this (again) apparently gender-neutral
                \u2018uniform\u2019 being available. A number of women working
                in offices might wear the <a
                href=\"http:\/\/www.next.co.uk\/women\/tailored-looks\">female
                equivalent of the business suit<\/a> (Next surely embodies this
                look), which more often than not includes a) skirt b) something
                frilly c) front-cover-flawless makeup. So it\u2019s the business
                suit, plus a) traditional emblem of femininity b) annoying and
                impractical emblem of femininity c) emblem of femininity that is
                often perceived to be caused by heavy external pressures to look
                good at all times. The visual \u2018uniform\u2019 of the
                business suit is not gender-neutral, because it is adapted to
                become gender-specific; whether this is due to individual taste
                or workplace culture, I\u2019m unsure, but it does inform the
                hierarchy of the office.<\/p>\n

                Rather than looking at personal comments regarding taste that
                may be made about office workwear, my interest instead lies in
                how this implicit dress code dramatically affects the
                hierarchical makeup of a working environment, potentially
                without many of the individuals involved even being fully aware
                of how it is being shaped around them. If I arrive tomorrow at
                work with a \u2018male\u2019 business suit on, will I be taken
                more seriously? Or, as a woman, if I arrive in a simulated
                version of that \u2018male\u2019 business suit, will I be
                declined respect because I appear too much like one of the boys?
                Am I feminine enough for the office if I don\u2019t wear
                flawless makeup \u2013 or any makeup? If I start dressing like
                the big boys, will they still know it\u2019s me on the inside? I
                believe there is a definite question of sexuality and sexual
                preference here that comes into play with \u2018levels\u2019 of
                femininity in the workplace, although I don\u2019t feel able to
                tackle this in great detail here (or just yet).<\/p>\n

                Workplace hierarchies are constituted through a vast number of
                factors, but the role of dress and dress codes is one that
                can\u2019t be ignored. From traditional environments where
                gender and authority hierarchies may have been distinguished and
                designated by an explicit uniform placed upon the workers,
                contemporary working environments \u2013 especially those in the
                creative industries \u2013 now have to juggle with an implicit
                dress code that is created and defined by the workers themselves
                (across all hierarchies) in their clothing choices. Plus, there
                is the added element of workers\u2019 perception of the
                importance of that dress code or, conversely, the desire to play
                with it and break some boundaries, in designating what you can,
                or can\u2019t, wear to work.<\/p>\n
