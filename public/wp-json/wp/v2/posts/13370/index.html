          Part 1: Agent Provocateur, Discourse and Performativity<\/h2>\n
          <p>
            In 1971, Vivienne Westwood and Malcolm McLaren set up \u2018Let it
            Rock\u2019, their first King\u2019s Road boutique. Their son Joseph
            Corr\u00e9 followed in his parents\u2019 footsteps and opened a shop
            in London with his wife Serena Rees in 1994. Named <a
            href=\"http:\/\/www.agentprovocateur.com\/\"
            target=\"_blank\"><strong
              >Agent Provocateur<\/strong><\/a>, the unusual boutique bridged a
              gap between the erotic lingerie sold in Soho\u2019s sex shops and
              the respectable prettiness of the established quality brands sold
              in department stores.<\/p>\n
              <p>
                Corr\u00e9 and Rees saw the brand as a vehicle for their
                creativity and their ideas about women and femininity. In 1995,
                they began a search for a woman who \u2018would represent the
                concepts behind the clothes, model new designs, and be a
                spokesperson at upcoming events\u2019. They saw the face of
                their brand as \u2018charming, glamorous, curvy, independent and
                intelligent\u2019 (see <a
                href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/Agent-Provocateur-Celebration-Femininity-Sexuality\/dp\/1858687586\"
                target=\"_blank\"><strong
                  >Agent Provocateur: A Celebration of
                  Femininity<\/strong><\/a>).<\/p>\n
                  <p>
                    The finalists of their competition were used as part of a
                    publicity stunt at London Fashion Week, staging a
                    demonstration against bland passionless fashion that drew
                    the attention of the assembled press. After a decadent Miss
                    Agent Provocateur Party had been held, where the winner was
                    announced, Corr\u00e9 and Rees realised that a single woman
                    couldn\u2019t represent their brand\u2019s values as the
                    concept was too diverse. Every woman has the potential to
                    become an agent provocateur.<br \ />\n<a

                    Corr\u00e9 and Rees have since divorced, and in 2007, Agent
                    Provocateur was purchased by <a
                    href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/3i\"
                    target=\"_blank\">3i Group<\/a>. This gradually led to a
                    significant change in how the Agent Provocateur woman was
                    represented in the brand\u2019s advertising campaigns. The
                    brochure to showcase the Spring\/Summer 2008 collection
                    retained a lot of the ethos of Corr\u00e9 and Rees\u2019
                    original vision. It has a cover designed to look like an
                    invitation to an exclusive party, featuring the text
                    \u2018you are cordially invited to attend a very private
                    affair [\u2026] Bring a blindfold and an open mind!\u2019.

                    The models are depicted as attendees of the party and are
                    engaging in activities of a sexual nature. Nothing
                    pornographic is depicted, merely hints of erotic and light
                    BDSM play. Most of the party guests are women, clothed in
                    Agent Provocateur lingerie and swimwear, but there are also
                    a number of men in the image. The women take both dominant
                    and submissive roles, whilst the men are purely
                    submissive.<\/p>\n

                    By contrast, the Autumn\/Winter 2012 collection is presented

                    associated campaign focuses on a woman in Victorian London

                    Each image contains between one and three female models,

                          Woman is desexualized at the very moment when she is
                          stripped naked. We may therefore say that we are
                          dealing in a sense with a spectacle based on fear, or
                          rather on the pretence of fear, as if eroticism here
                          went no further than a sort of delicious terror, whose
                          ritual signs have only to be announced to evoke at
                          once the idea of sex and its

                          At the very heart of the original concept of the Agent
                          Provocateur brand, when it was founded by Corr\u00e9
                          and Rees, was the idea of lingerie as a ritual sign
                          which evoked the idea of sex. Although they sought to
                          design underwear which referenced socially acceptable
                          quality French lingerie, eroticism was very much a
                          part of Agent Provocateur\u2019s core values. They
                          made the brand accessible to women who would not
                          normally venture into sex shops to purchase erotic
                          lingerie.<\/p>\n

                          It could be argued that Corr\u00e9 and Rees were also
                          responding to dominant discourse on sexuality and
                          gender when they set up Agent Provocateur in the

                            Michel Foucault analyses changes in discourse on
                            sexuality and argues that discourse is a productive
                            force; for example, leading to definitions of
                            \u201cnormal\u201d and \u201cother\u201d. He also
                            looks at the concept of docile bodies versus active
                            agency, discussing reverse discourse as an
                            empowering method of countering the dominant

                                  It is widely understood that gender is a
                                  cultural construction that is shaped by
                                  discursive forces. One of the main issues
                                  considered by Judith Butler is the
                                  performativity of gender. Gender is not a

                                          and explores the concept of agency.
                                          Gender and identity are more of a
