  &#8220;Well, I like DVDs, obviously! Also, books and comics and random toys.
  These are not all from this year, and they&#8217;re not all presents. I tend
  to get clothes for Christmas! But anyway, in no particular order:<\/p>\n

      >Agora<\/strong><\/a>: Hypatia writes new mathematical theorems while
      Alexandria burns. I love Rachel Weisz, and although this film makes me cry
      a lot, I think it&#8217;s ace.<\/li>\n

          books, and this BBC adaptation is the best by far. The new version has

          Regency England as cloaked in pastels.<\/li>\n

                  Alan Moore graphic novel. It&#8217;s sort of steampunky, I

                      well known? Flight attendant Blythe is afraid of flying,
                      but this doesn&#8217;t stop her from a magic realism tour
                      of lands that don&#8217;t exist. Bonus: positive
                      depictions of Islam, Amelia Earhart being awesome beyond
                      words, and things not being quite they seem. A bit like a
                      cross between Angela Carter and Salman Rushdie in graphic
                      novel format.<\/li>\n

                            her relationship with (the big, bad) Bigby Wolf is
