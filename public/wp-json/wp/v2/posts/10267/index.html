<p>
  It&#8217;s Mother&#8217;s Day today, and although there have been lots of
  influences in our lives which might have turned us towards feminism,
  we&#8217;ve found that lots of feminists &#8216;blame&#8217; their mothers for
  starting them thinking about things like gender and equality. I asked some of
  the BadRep team about their mothers&#8230;<\/p>\n

    &#8220;I would say I was raised very feminist. The family has a
    double-barreled surname because my folks hyphenated their names to negotiate
    the whole names and marriage thing. (Pro tip: don\u2019t hyphenate \u2013
    people will assume you\u2019re really posh, and if both names are unusual
    you\u2019ll spend the rest of your life spelling it out to people.)<\/p>\n

    \/><\/a>&#8220;I always identified with feminism and was never scared of the
    word. \u00a0I was brought up to believe I could do anything I wanted and my
    mom made a point of giving me and my brother equal access to all types of
    toys \u2013 like having boy dolls as well as girl dolls. She also always
    named sexism where she saw it. This was a real gift because growing up I saw
    sexism as a bad thing and a lazy assumption, rather than just the status
    quo.<\/p>\n
  </p>
  <p>
    &#8220;As I\u2019ve grown up I\u2019ve realised retrospectively just how rad
    my mom was \u2013 <a
    href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/2011\/09\/08\/revolting-women-greenham-common\/\">she
    went to Greenham Common<\/a>, she bought <a
    href=\"http:\/\/www.grassrootsfeminism.net\/cms\/node\/234\"><strong
      >Spare Rib<\/strong><\/a> magazine, she had rainbow shoelaces (which
      I\u2019ve stolen) &#8211; but also I\u2019m profoundly grateful that she
      never ever let me become fucked up about food and body image, or to
      correlate body-image with self-worth. I really feel like I\u2019ve dodged
      a massive bullet with that one and am a lot better off than many women
      because of it.<\/p>\n
      <p>
        Love you, Mom (now quit pestering me about grandkids).&#8221;<\/p>\n

          &#8220;My Mum didn&#8217;t really raise me in a &#8216;feminist
          way&#8217;, but the cumulative actions of my parents together has
          helped to shape my views on the world and, more specifically the
          concept of equality. \u00a0As I understand it, my Mum took time off
          work to look after me when I was very little and after my brother was
          born too, but when he was old enough, Mum and Dad essentially swapped.
          \u00a0Mum went back to working in the City and Dad became a
          househusband right up until I was 12 years old. \u00a0Having a mother
          who worked full time in London and a stay-at-home dad is bound to have
          an effect (insert some philosophical\/psychological insight into
          strong independent female figures and role models), but that
          wasn&#8217;t the only thing.<\/p>\n

          before they had me (their first child) they sat down and made the time
          to discuss and agree that there would be no greater importance placed
          on one parent or the other based on their gender. \u00a0So if Mum was
          looking after us and we did something naughty, there would be no
          &#8216;just you wait until your Father gets home!&#8217; threat of
          punishment&#8230; you just got punished by whichever parent was there.
          \u00a0Or, indeed, my Grandma when we lived with her for a while (who
          is also a huge influence on my feminist tendencies).&#8221;<\/p>\n

          <p>
            &#8220;Let&#8217;s be clear on one thing: my mother (who is
            Bulgarian) is a farmer&#8217;s daughter. Whatever else she became
            later on, she can still kill and pluck a chicken, cure many common
            ailments with mysterious herbs, and pick tobacco leaves with her
            bare hands (no lie: she still has the scars). Of course,
            that&#8217;s not all she is. For one thing, when the local doctor
            decided to try bloodletting to cure my infant aunt&#8217;s colic, my
            mother snatched her from the doctor&#8217;s hands and ran away with
            her, reasoning that the doctor was a fool and that at nine years old
            she was clearly more qualified to treat her sister. (Who was fine,
            by the way, due in no small measure to my mother&#8217;s
            interference.) By the time my mother was thirteen, she had outgrown
            her local village school, and so she simply packed her bags and
            moved out of the family home to a nearby city to continue her
            education.<\/p>\n

            her friends were getting married and having children, she stayed
            resolutely single and enrolled at a university instead. A few years
            later she scandalised polite society by taking up with an
            older\u00a0divorcee who \u2013 shockingly \u2013 was both Armenian
            and a dissident. When he set off to sea in that dreadfully romantic
            way that makes sense only in films, she ran the household, raised
            two children,\u00a0led the local community group and dealt with the
            persistent interest of the secret police. She taught me to cook, and
            to sew, and to knit, and explained that while it was nice to see my
            father every once in a while, fundamentally I\u2019d have to be
            prepared to run a household \u2013 a community \u2013 a country
            \u2013 all by myself.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            (The one thing she ever forbade me to do was to become an
            accountant. Her reason? \u201cBoring.\u201d)<\/p>\n

          <p>
            &#8220;In this different country, with Communism a fading memory
            from far away, my mother blends into the background, no different
            from any of the millions of women in our cities and villages. But
            when the light is right, and if you know how to look, she is still
            the twenty-year-old in the pictures: the one with the long hair and
            the wide smile, who shimmied down the side of a building to sneak
            away from the secret police and escape, laughing, on the back of her
            dissident lover\u2019s motorcycle.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            I think we can all be grateful she decided to be a mother, rather
            than an Evil Overlady.<\/p>\n
          </p>

            As for the accountancy? I hate to say it, but I should have listened
