  So Southern civil rights fairytale <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt1454029\/\"><strong
    >The Help<\/strong><\/a> didn&#8217;t prove to be the Oscar bait it was
    predicted to be, apart from Best Supporting Actress for Octavia Spencer,
    even though it has many of the necessary elements gloriously summarised in

      At the time it was released the debates online reminded me I wanted to
      write something about the modern day &#8216;help&#8217;: the estimated
      16,000 domestic workers who enter the UK every year, most of whom are
      women, and most migrating for economic reasons. Then on Thursday last
      week, Home Secretary Theresa May announced some changes to immigration law
      which will put the thousands of migrant women working in domestic service
      in the UK today at far greater risk of exploitation.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      In case it passed you by when it came out, the plot of
      <strong
        >The Help<\/strong> is this: a young white woman (&#8216;Skeeter&#8217;)
        returns from college with idealistic plans to be a serious writer.
        Rather than documenting the petty dramas of her affluent circle, she
        shocks them all by interviewing &#8216;the help&#8217; and telling the
        stories of the black maids and nurses she and her friends were raised by
        who are subject to humiliation and exploitation by their
        employers.<\/p>\n

              UK mainstream film reviews were broadly positive, and steered away
              from any prickly issues around the representation of the black
              characters or the glorified role of the white woman writer.
              Although I&#8217;ve heard it praised for the strong female
              characters it contains, when I dipped into the US feminist
              blogosphere (sorry to use that word &#8211; if it helps I&#8217;ve
              started to imagine it as a sort of aquasphere, plumbing the depths
              of the sea of misogyny) it was a different story.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              Hands up &#8211; I haven&#8217;t seen the film. But I wanted to
              share some of the interesting comments and criticism I&#8217;ve
              read which seem to confirm my suspicions that whatever positive
              portrayals of women the film contains come with a dollop of
              racefail.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              There&#8217;s a good selection of excerpts from reviews over at <a

                    miles to their jobs in white people&#8217;s homes in a bid
                    for their civil rights. How offensive to imply that what a
                    group of grown black women needs is for a young white woman
                    to come alert them they are &#8220;enslaved&#8221; and them

                                What does remain, though, is the novel\u2019s
                                conceit that the white characters, with their
                                troubled relationships and unloved children,
                                carry burdens equal to those of the black
                                characters. Like the novel, the movie is about
                                ironing out differences and letting go of the

                                I think it&#8217;s a fascinating debate, and I
                                don&#8217;t feel I&#8217;ve got anything to add.
                                Instead it made me think of the extent to which

                                revealed in

                                  course, the film is dealing with a very
                                  specific place and time, but there&#8217;s an
                                  army of women workers today who are dished out
                                  the same kind of exploitation and degradation
                                  seen in the film, and worse.<\/p>\n
                                  <p>
                                    In 2006 there were around 2 million domestic
                                    servants in Britain, more than in Victorian
                                    times. Of course, not all domestic work is
                                    exploitative. It even takes in gardeners at
                                    its broadest definition. But there is
                                    definitely something that makes me feel
                                    uncomfortable about the numbers of usually
                                    migrant women cleaning the houses of middle
