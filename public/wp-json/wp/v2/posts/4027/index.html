<p>
  Internet, I&#8217;m sorry. I&#8217;m not a
  <strong
    >Coen Brothers<\/strong> fan. The last film I saw by them was
    <strong
      >O Brother, Where Art Thou?<\/strong> which I primarily watched because
      it&#8217;s based loosely on the Odyssey, and I&#8217;m nothing if not an
      epic poetry nerd. People told me to hold my trousers and undergarments
      close about me lest I laughed them off. All leg-coverings, I&#8217;m
      afraid to say, remained steadfastly, unamusedly attached. I didn&#8217;t
      like it. I was ostracised from the film-loving community for six months.
      It was a sad time.<\/p>\n
      <p>
        So when people were piping delirious at me that there was
        <em
          >oh my god, a new Coen Brothers film out!<\/em> &#8211; I wasn&#8217;t
          massively over-excited. I also heard it was a remake, and I&#8217;m
          not vastly excited about those, either. And
          <em
            >then<\/em> I heard it was a
            <em
              >Western<\/em>; the film genre I&#8217;m
              <em
                >least<\/em> excited about. So please understand, then, the
                genial ambivalence that coursed, skin-tone-knuckled, through my
                laid-back veins as I sauntered casually to see
                <strong
                  >True Grit<\/strong> last Thursday.<\/p>\n
                  <p>
                    <strong
                      >*** For those who&#8217;ve not seen it, the SPOILER
                      WARNING goes here.***<\/strong><\/p>\n
                      <p>
                        I went to see it at my local Picturehouse cinema, which
                        is my favourite cinema in the world (except for the old
                        Odeon in Pwllheli, Wales, which has honest-to-god
                        curtains and an usherette &#8211; or at least it did
                        last time I went, which was in the 90s!) because of its
                        serene, sociable atmosphere and gorgeous staff.
                        It&#8217;s nothing like Vue, which &#8211; despite
                        having equally beautiful staff &#8211; stresses me out
                        with its up-selling and chemical-weapon nachos. By the
                        time I&#8217;d got to my seat, I was practically
                        horizontal with how much chillaxing was going down Chez
                        Moi, and even the beautiful car advert with the people
                        tangoing barely got my blood pressure above a
                        whisper.<\/p>\n

                        an atypical female lead character. Sure enough,

                                              adversary. The men she encounters
                                              infantilise her, call her
                                              &#8220;baby sister&#8221; and
                                              regularly denounce her as
                                              &#8220;ugly&#8221;, as though the

                                              beauty. She easily proves that she
                                              has more than looks to offer

                                                  I am thoroughly depressed to
                                                  admit that I was expecting a
                                                  rape, having not read the book
                                                  and given the common trope of

                                                  this pans out, therefore, in
                                                  the book the film is based on,
                                                  but Mattie is grossly
                                                  manhandled and spanked in the
                                                  film by LaBoeuf after she

                                                    feels like a total

                                                    and culminates in one of the
                                                    times that Cogburn steps in
