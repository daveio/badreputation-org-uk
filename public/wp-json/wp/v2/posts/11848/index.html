    <p>
      Thanks to a suggestion from a friend, I recently managed to catch the end
      of New York performance artist Penny Arcade&#8217;s show
      <strong
        >Bitch!Dyke!Faghag!Whore!<\/strong> at the <a
        href=\"http:\/\/www.arcolatheatre.com\/\">Arcola Tent<\/a> in Dalston,
        London. That seemed like the right venue for it, with the tent walls,
        benches and tables it felt partway between cabaret and circus.<\/p>\n
        <p>
          Normally, either of those words would have me running for the hills.
          My first boyfriend was a juggler, which after two years compounded my
          existing distaste for most forms of &#8216;fun&#8217; and has left me
          with a severe allergy to audience participation of all kinds. For the
          record, I also dislike games, sport, karaoke, &#8216;street
          theatre&#8217;, children and dogs.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          I decided to brave the striped tent of intense social awkwardness on
          this occasion because the friend who invited me has a similar outlook,
          so I could trust her not to shove me onstage. And also because the
          show is about sex and politics, two of my very favourite
          subjects.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <h3>
          Penny and her show<\/h3>\n
          <p>
            If you don&#8217;t know who Penny Arcade is, here&#8217;s her rather
            fascinating <a
            href=\"http:\/\/pennyarcade.tv\/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2&amp;Itemid=3\">biography<\/a>.
            And here&#8217;s a kind of trailer for the show from the Arcola to
            give you a flavour:<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            <iframe
            src=\"http:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/39408749?color=c9ff23\"
            frameborder=\"0\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            The video makes it look more raunchy than it really was &#8211; the
            dizzying, sexy, cabaret feel it tries to create was there, but I
            think my favourite bits of the show and the ones that have stayed
            with me are the points where the spectacle gave way to tenderness,
            solemnity and rage.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            Penny Arcade employs stand up, memoir, satire, comedy character
            monologues and political rants to talk about censorship and sexual
            repression, class, sexuality, LGBTQI rights, HIV, feminism, gender,
            capitalism and Barbie.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            There was also a lot of what other reviewers have apparently called
            &#8216;hippy stuff&#8217; about there being one love and one hate
            and the importance of people breaking down the walls between them to
            work together for change. And a light sprinkling of green politics
            and anarchism.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            It felt a bit fluffy, but the incredible passion, openness and
            warmth of Penny Arcade herself and her performance went a long way
            to breaking down my cynicism. Besides, in amongst the fluff were
            observations which hit home like a dart. On prejudice and
            discrimination for example: &#8220;They&#8217;re afraid of being it,
            so they want to make someone else it.&#8221; Yes.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <h3>
            Sexxxy dancing. Hm.<\/h3>\n
            <p>
              A mixed group of erotic dancers were onstage (and in the audience)
              most of the time, and Penny introduced them by name. As someone
              who doesn&#8217;t spend an awful lot of time in my usual life
              watching people dancing in thongs, it was an interesting
              experience. Safely bracketed by Art, and in the feminist hands of
              the show&#8217;s creator, I tried to honestly examine my own
              response to it without the fear of being complicit in
              exploitation.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              It was sexy. Sort of. The thrustiness of the male dancers was just
              alarming, I found myself marvelling at it the same way I would
              watching a hummingbird beat its wings 80 times a second. But the
              women and the way they moved did flick my switches. Not much, but
              that could be because I was furiously analysing all my reactions
              as I had them, which is a bit distracting.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              I&#8217;ve not got space here to go into my views on the sex
              industry (another day maybe) but they don&#8217;t fit comfortably
              into the boxes of &#8216;pro&#8217; or &#8216;anti&#8217;. Early
              in the show Penny said she viewed erotic dance as the most
              powerful form of feminist expression because it was the only thing
              designed by women to control men, among the millions of things
              designed by men to control women. I don&#8217;t buy it. It worked
              for\u00a0<a title=\"Salome\"
              href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Salome\"
              target=\"_blank\">Salome<\/a>, sure, but anyone else? If so, can
              one of you remarkable women please stop the government from
              renewing Trident for me please? BUT. That&#8217;s not to say it
              can&#8217;t be a form of feminist expression, and a powerful one
              at that.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              The centrepiece of the show feels the closest to what I think of
              as performance art. A striptease with a US flag, performed by
              Penny Arcade herself while a video of Lenny Bruce&#8217;s famous
              rant about the illogical and repressive nature of US obscenity
              laws plays large in the background. She wasn&#8217;t in a
              spotlight, and whenever she received a cheer she would point at
              the screen to say &#8216;listen!&#8217; It felt defiant but not
              triumphant, and stood out from the rest of the show as an act of
              resistance rather than a celebration.<\/p>\n
