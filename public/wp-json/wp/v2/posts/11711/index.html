<p>Hello. My name is Rei, and I read romance novels.<\/p>\n</p>
<p>
  I&#8217;ve been weirdly obsessed with romance novels for about the past two
  years. I read my first one a lot longer ago than that \u2013 I abducted and
  read, over a period of about three weeks, a romance with a name I can&#8217;t
  remember about a Japanese lady falling in love with an American man just after
  World War II during my breaks in volunteering at a nursing home \u2013 but I
  didn&#8217;t really think all that much about them for a while afterwards.
  Then I stumbled upon <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.smartbitchestrashybooks.com\">Smart Bitches, Trashy
  Books<\/a> and started following it because, damn, those ladies are hilarious,
  and from there started following <a href=\"http:\/\/dearauthor.com\">Dear
  Author<\/a> as well, who focus on snark a little less (although they can also
  be pretty funny) but who are nevertheless thoughtful and insightful in their
  reviews. For a long time, I was an avid follower of the romance industry
  without ever actually having picked up more than two romances.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>And then I got a Kindle for Christmas.<\/p>\n</p>
<p>
  You guys, for the reluctant obsessive, ebook readers are poison in
  super-convenient button-clicky packaging. Thanks to its extreme
  user-friendliness and the large number of freebooks available on the Amazon
  website (in case anybody is worried that I&#8217;m being paid for advertising,
  the wireless keeps breaking and sometimes the thing refuses to charge) I have
  something like one hundred romance novels on my Kindle now \u2013 a
  conservative estimate, not taking into account non-category romances and books
  debatably qualified for the title. I can&#8217;t stop reading them, and I
  can&#8217;t stop talking about them; I am fascinated by romance novels, in
  spite of the fact that more often than not picking one up guarantees that I
  will spend half the book with my jaw clenched to the point of pain. It&#8217;s
  a guilty pleasure, if by \u201cpleasure\u201d you mean
  \u201cbafflement-inducing\u201d and \u201cguilty\u201d you mean \u201cthing
  that I am liable to be judged for\u201d.<\/p>\n

  data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/a>So what brings me to all the jaw-clenching?
  Well, I&#8217;ve been a reader ever since I was a kid \u2013 I&#8217;ve tried
  pretty much every genre of fiction, from fantasy to crime to sci-fi to sci-fi
  fantasy crime \u2013 and category romance is, without question, the most
  formulaic genre I have ever come across. It&#8217;s baffling. I mean, every
  genre has its stock characters and tropes, but while there are things that
  crop up a lot in, say, fantasy, as far as I can see the only thing really
  required to write a fantasy novel is the strong enough conviction that what
  you&#8217;re writing is fantasy. Write a category romance, and your story is
  pretty much plotted out for you. Don&#8217;t believe me? Let&#8217;s take a
  look at the submission guidelines for <a
  href=\"http:\/\/uat2.millsandboon.co.uk\/AAModernR.asp\">Mills and Boon Modern
  Romance<\/a> (the UK version of Harlequin Presents):<\/p>\n
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Readers are whisked away to exclusive jet-set locations&#8230;When the hero
    strides into the story he&#8217;s a powerful, ruthless man who knows exactly
    what &#8211; and who &#8211; he wants and he isn&#8217;t used to taking no
    for an answer! Yet he has depth and integrity, and he will do anything to
    make the heroine his. Though she may be shy and vulnerable, she&#8217;s also
    plucky and determined to challenge his arrogant pursuit.<\/p>\n
  </p>
  <p>
    Modern Romance explores emotional themes that are universal. These should be
    played out as part of highly-charged conflicts that are underpinned by
    blistering sexual anticipation and released as passionate
    lovemaking&#8230;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n
  </p>
  <p>
    Got that? So, your story has to be somewhere \u201cexclusive and
    jet-set\u201d (what does \u201cjet-set\u201d actually mean in this context?
    I sort of expect the entire thing to be set in the Business Class lounge at
    Stansted) and your hero needs to be a Romance Novel Hero, you know, hot and
    alpha and, well, willing to be kind of creepy if he thinks it&#8217;ll help.
    (Bonus points if he&#8217;s so manly that his manliness bursts out of the
    cover &#8211; for reference, please see the pictured-below edition of
    <strong
      >The Very Virile Viking<\/strong>, one of the most beautifully
      alliteratively-titled works of romance that I have ever come across.) And
      your heroine needs to challenge him but also be vulnerable to him. And
      they need to clash and eventually express that clash through a lot of hot
      sex.<\/p>\n

        \/><\/a>Yes, there are a lot of variations you can play out on that
        theme \u2013 which I suspect is why publishers like Mills and Boon are a
        long way away from getting stale \u2013 but ultimately this frame is
        pretty limiting, and it makes it easier to see why romance novels are
        stereotyped as all the same. And this moulding of the romance novel
        storyline doesn&#8217;t stop with the publishing guidelines; the romance
        novel review websites I follow do downgrade books that fail to deliver
        on agreed-upon \u201cromance trademarks\u201d, although in fairness the
        only one that seems to need strict adherence is that of the HEA
        (that&#8217;s Happily Ever After, to those of you who use their time
        much more wisely than I do). Even that strikes me as strange, because
        while I can understand it as a trend \u2013 if, as common theory
        purports, romance novels are wish fulfilment fantasies, why
        wouldn&#8217;t they have a happy ending? &#8211; I can&#8217;t wrap my
        head around it as the thing which makes a romance novel
        <em
          >romantic<\/em>. More on that later.<\/p>\n
          <p>
            Which brings me, finally, to this: Why do I think it useful to
            subject romance novels to feminist analysis? Aren&#8217;t they just,
            as a friend of mine once put it, \u201cgranny porn\u201d? Is there
            any mileage in analysing such an outdated form of trashy
            entertainment from a feminist perspective?<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            I obviously think so, or I wouldn&#8217;t be writing this. And
            here&#8217;s why:
            <em
              >most romance novel writers are women, writing for a female
              audience<\/em>. I&#8217;ve read some (very good) romance novels
              written by men geared towards women, but only a very few, and they
              tend to focus on gay male couplings \u2013 in other words, not
              part of the main body of mainstream romance publishing. (LGBT
              people in romance novels is a whole &#8216;nother article.) More
              troubling is that most of the flaws and foibles of romance tropes
              that persist even today \u2013 virginal women, marriage and babies
              or nothing, and the time-honoured classic of \u201cforced
              seduction\u201d &#8211; are overwhelmingly shrugged off as
              \u201cit&#8217;s just wish fulfilment\u201d.<\/p>\n
              <p>Is it?<\/p>\n</p>
              <p>
                As a lifelong avid reader, I&#8217;m no stranger to escaping
                into a good book. And I have no doubt that there are people out
                there who don&#8217;t really want a relationship in which the
                man takes charge, sweeps the lady off her feet, and loves her
                with a love that&#8217;s never been loved before until her
                resolve melts into baby-making funtimes, but can still get into
                a traditional romance plotline just for kicks. But is this still
                (or has it ever been) so overpoweringly The Female Fantasy that
                it&#8217;s the go-to, the default, the only world a romance fan
                wants to escape into? Why are these elements so built into
                \u201cwomen&#8217;s\u201d fiction? And what, in the end, does
                that tell us about the cultural narrative that has been built
                around us?<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                Those are the questions I want to answer; they&#8217;re the main
                thing going around in my head every time I pick up a new
                romance, and they are what keeps me reading whenever I finish
                one that has made me want to drill a hole through my skull.
                (Which isn&#8217;t all of them! Some are quite good. Maybe
                someday I&#8217;ll tell you about them.)<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                To get us started, though, over the next few weeks I&#8217;ll be
                doing a rundown of what I think are the five most central tropes
                or stock characters in romance novels. It&#8217;s going to be
                difficult to whittle the list down that far, but I&#8217;ll
                power through it. Honest. I don&#8217;t really need this
                university education.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                Over the course of the series, I&#8217;ll look at the trope
                itself, where, when and how it shows up in different genres, and
                how I think it&#8217;s been adapted for the modern romance
                novel, because if there&#8217;s another thing that seems to be
                true of romance? It&#8217;s that they never throw anything away.
                I&#8230;am no one to judge on that, as anybody who&#8217;s seen
                my living space will be able to attest, but there&#8217;s an
                impressive level of trope-hoarding that goes on around here, and
                I&#8217;m going to show you why. I&#8217;ll also be probing a
                bit into what that means for romance storylines as a
                whole.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                So stay tuned for Instalment One, which is going to be the
                aforementioned Virginal Heroine! Are you excited? I&#8217;m
                excited.<\/p>\n
