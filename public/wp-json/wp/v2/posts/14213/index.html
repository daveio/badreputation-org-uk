<p>
  A while ago a friend lent me an excellent anthology:
  <strong
    ><a href=\"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/6310843-the-darker-sex\"
    target=\"_blank\">The Darker Sex: Tales of the Supernatural and Macabre by
    Victorian Women Writers<\/a><\/strong>. It sounded so far up my street I
    expected to find it waiting for me on the doorstep as I scurried home to
    read it.<\/p>\n
    <p>
      As you might imagine, it includes a lot of creepy old mansions, brave
      governesses, and ghostly women wandering around in white gowns. I love
      that stuff. But towards the back I was delighted to discover something
      unusual: a Marxist Feminist vampire story.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      The story was
      <strong

          target=\"_blank\">The Wind In The Rose Bush<\/a><\/strong>.\u00a0While
          the events are definitely supernatural, Luella is more of a
          metaphorical than literal vampire, mesmerising and leeching the life
          force from her victims by draining their energy rather than their
          blood.<\/p>\n
          <p>
            Her fellow townsfolk, men and women, old and young, literally work
            themselves to death in her service. One after another they become
            obsessed with caring for her, doing her washing and sewing, cooking
            her meals, making her coffee, working until they become ill and
            eventually die, when they are replaced by another willing
            servant.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            The story is narrated several decades on by Lydia Anderson, the last
            person alive who knew Luella; she didn&#8217;t succumb to her
            mysterious power. As Lydia puts it: &#8220;There was somethin&#8217;
            about Luella Miller seemed to draw the heart right out of you, but
            she didn&#8217;t draw it out of\u00a0<em
              >me<\/em>.&#8221; She tells the story of all the people whom
              Luella drained of life, including her sister-in-law Lily:<\/p>\n
              <blockquote>
                <p>
                  This Lily Miller had been hardly past her first youth, and a
                  most robust and blooming woman, rosy-cheeked, with curls of
                  strong, black hair overshadowing round, candid temples and
                  bright dark eyes. It was not six months after she had taken up
                  her residence with her sister-in-law that her rosy colour
                  faded and her pretty curves became wan hollows.\u00a0White
                  shadows began to show in the black rings of her hair, and the
                  light died out of her eyes, her features sharpened, and there
                  were pathetic lines at her mouth, which yet wore always an
                  expression of utter sweetness and even happiness. She was
                  devoted to her sister; there was no doubt that she loved her
                  with her whole heart, and was perfectly content in her
                  service. It was her sole anxiety lest she should die and leave
                  her alone&#8230;<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  &#8230;all the time Luella wa&#8217;n&#8217;t liftin&#8217;
                  her finger and poor Lily didn&#8217;t get any care except what
                  the neighbours gave her, and Luella eat up everythin&#8217;
                  that was carried in for Lily. I had it real straight that she
                  did. Luella used to just sit and cry and do nothin&#8217;. She
                  did act real fond of Lily, and she pined away considerable,
                  too. There was those that thought she&#8217;d go into a
                  decline herself. But after Lily died, her Aunt, Abby Mixter
                  came, and then Luella picked up and grew as fat and rosy as
                  ever.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  Unlike many fictional vampires, Luella does not seem to intend
                  any harm against her victims. She is indifferent, almost
                  oblivious. Her supernatural ability to enslave her neighbours
                  does not seem to be within her control; instead, it is more
                  like a poisonous vapour that surrounds her, simultaneously
                  enchanting and slowly destroying them.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  Another interesting aspect of the story is the emphasis on
                  Luella&#8217;s infantile need. It is not simply that she will
                  not care for herself, forcing others to look after her, but
                  that she
                  <em
                    >cannot<\/em>. She is entirely helpless, so that when the
                    town finally begins to keep its distance, she herself begins
                    to weaken.<\/p>\n

                      Nakagawa sees Luella Miller as a feminist parable about
                      the suppression of agency and independence in the feminine
                      ideal taken to it&#8217;s logical, monstrous,
                      conclusion:<\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p>
                        By spreading her dependency and helplessness into
                        others, Luella makes others experience her dreadful
                        state&#8230; Functioning as an addictive substance,
                        Luella Miller lets us see how fearful it is to be a
                        feminine woman without her own
                        self.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<div id=\"attachment_14219\"

                      <p>
                        I think this is an interesting take, as if Luella exists
                        only as an object of others&#8217; self destructive
                        love, with no subjective self, no agency or control. It
                        is this that makes her state &#8220;dreadful&#8221;. She
                        is parasitic, overwhelming and consuming her host, but
                        unable to survive without them.<\/p>\n
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Without the contrasting courage, agency and practicality
                        of &#8220;hale and hearty&#8221; 87 year old narrator
                        Lydia Anderson, the story could seem to be a misogynist
                        attack on wealthy women.<\/p>\n
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        But \u00a0I agree with Lynda L. Hinkle and\u00a0her

                        Female Vampires as Class Structure Critique<\/a>, when
                        she describes the story as: &#8220;a stinging critique
                        of a declining but still prevalent social class
                        structure that churned out a large, useless upper class
                        of women whose job it was to be beautiful and

                      <p>
                        I read the story as a comment on the economic and social
                        structures which manufactured useless creatures like
                        Luella, wealthy women who were prevented from acquiring
                        ideas,\u00a0skills, purpose or independence. The same
                        structures, while fetishising helplessness as the
                        supreme feminine virtue on the one hand, forced
                        countless other women (and men) to work themselves into
                        an early grave in the service of their
                        betters.<\/p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy
