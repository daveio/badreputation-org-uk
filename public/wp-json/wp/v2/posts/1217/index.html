      Sexuality in Rock&#8217;n&#8217;roll is one more area weighed down heavily
      by its history and language. While none could or should deny the aspects
      of sexual interest and thrill inherent in live music, the performance
      space is problematically male-dominated.<br \ />\n\u2013 Ian Penman, NME,

        Women in bands, when under the media spotlight, often find themselves
        swindled out of due credit by virtue of their gender. If they\u2019re
        not being accused of clinging to the coattails of their backing boys to
        disguise their own lack of musical ability, they\u2019re being judged on
        their aesthetic appeal to the exclusion of anything more relevant.
        It\u2019s disappointing to observe how ubiquitously this principle
        applies. Even in the midst of punk, as girls picked up guitars, bass,
        and drumsticks, taking the stage alongside boys as more than cooing
        vocalists or backing dancers, they attracted that lethal combination of
        critical suspicion and prurient interest.<\/p>\n

                      through several layers of punk sediment before the Adverts
                      come to light. They were one of the first punk bands to
                      gain commercial success, and how much of this achievement
                      was down to Gaye is open to depressing debate. A
                      groundbreaking example of the Babe on Bass, her experience
                      prefigured the problems faced by lone women in bands from
                      Blondie to Paramore: scepticism towards their musical
                      ability tied to a disproportionate focus on their

                          Gaye\u2019s elevation to national sweetheart began as
                          a generic punk fairytale. In 1976, she and her partner
                          TV Smith made an escape in time-honoured fashion from
                          their Devonshire coastal town to London, where they
                          swiftly formed a band. The Adverts became a fixture at

                              caught your eye, you caught your breath. Her
                              iconic look \u2013 battered black leather and a
                              kohl-rimmed thousand-yard stare \u2013 drew on

                              rocker fundamentalism rather than the try-hard
                              iconoclasm of Jordan or Siouxsie. Gaye was
                              punk\u2019s terrifyingly blank, stark, dead-eyed
                              minimalism made flesh, the girl nihilist next

                              For Greil Marcus, both Gaye and the Slits were

                              ugly enough. As the reminiscences of her admirers
                              on tribute websites and YouTube comments testify,
                              Gaye was punk\u2019s first female pin-up. Her
                              press and TV appearances stirred hearts and
                              hormones across late-70s Britain, pulling the plug

                                In a 2001 interview with the website <a
                                href=\"http:\/\/www.punk77.co.uk\/groups\/advertsinterviewwithgayeadvert.htm\">Punk77<\/a>,
                                Gaye recalled that &#8220;the media would
                                concentrate on irrelevant things like clothes or
                                be extra critical of my playing in the same way
                                that some men are prejudiced against women
                                drivers&#8221;. The hackneyed trope of whether
                                girls can play seems especially incongruous in
                                punk, a musical movement studded with gleeful
                                and defiant amateurism. Nevertheless,
                                Gaye\u2019s playing was picked on as
                                &#8220;plodding&#8221; and her mute \u2018fixed
                                sultriness\u2019 unfavourably compared with the
                                vocal talent of other punk women. This latter
                                criticism betrays, among other things, a
                                peculiar disapproval of girls in non-singing
                                positions, as though there were a correct set of
                                requirements for band composition, with musical
                                preoccupation on the part of female members an
                                intrinsically suspicious transgression of their

                                Dismissal of Gaye\u2019s musical credentials
                                went hand-in-hand with an insistence on her
                                value as eye-candy. According to the
                                <strong
                                  >NME<\/strong>, their bassist\u2019s
                                  \u2018superb squeakers\u2019 were the best
                                  thing about the Adverts and the only

                                  they might attract. Stiff Records instantly
                                  latched onto Gaye\u2019s looks as a marketing
                                  tool, giving the Adverts\u2019 <a

                                  band\u2019s name an afterthought. This was a
                                  stunt pulled without the band\u2019s prior
                                  knowledge, which Gaye avenged by refusing to
                                  appear in other band photographs for the
                                  single.<\/p>\n

                                    As the Adverts gained more media attention,
                                    Gaye\u2019s image began to dominate the
                                    band\u2019s press. Again, the novelty of her
                                    status as sole female in a role other than
                                    singer seemed to confer as much fascination
                                    as her looks. She complained of fending off
                                    photographers\u2019 requests for her
                                    &#8220;to pose with my jacket undone&#8221;
                                    and sudden &#8220;leching&#8221; from men
                                    she\u2019d considered her friends. After

                                                explain her as a continuation of
