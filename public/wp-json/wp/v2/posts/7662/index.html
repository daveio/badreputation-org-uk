  Yesterday we posted Part 1 of our interview with anti-cuts activist Roxanne,
  who told us some pretty unsettling stuff about her experience of being
  arrested &#8211; <a

<p>On with Part 2, then. <\/p>\n</p>
<p>
  <strong
    >Let&#8217;s talk about UK Uncut as a movement. Do you reckon it&#8217;s
    pretty equally gender split, and if so, do you reckon acting as a collective
    helps achieve this more effectively?<\/strong><\/p>\n
    <p>
      &#8220;I wouldn\u2019t feel confident commenting on the gender split in UK
      Uncut &#8211; I&#8217;d be referring to tens of thousands of people across
      the UK. However, in terms of active groups working within the UK, the
      majority are dominated by white males. But this is why we need to be
      talking about cuts in terms of gender: to encourage women to join the
      frontline.<\/p>\n

      \/><\/a>&#8220;I do feel that acting publically as a collective has
      strengthened the movement and UK Uncut\u2019s message \u2013 the cuts are
      something that everyone should be concerned about and everyone should be
      acting against. However, it is still true that certain vulnerable groups
      within society are to be hit in ways that the more privileged may not be.
      Disabled people are losing their Disability Living Allowance, poorer
      students have lost the EMA that they and their families rely on, and some
      women will no longer be able to work because they now have to care for
      elderly family members or young children. I strongly believe that
      highlighting the different ways in which the cuts fall should spur people
      into action, on behalf of themselves or those less able, instead of acting
      in some divisive way. So what if today we\u2019re standing up against cuts
      to childcare and you don\u2019t have or want children &#8211; don\u2019t
      you want to protect those in society who do? <\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;These aren\u2019t just issues for women, because protecting women
      and vulnerable groups is in the interest of the whole of
      society.&#8221;<\/p>\n

        >Have you found any women&#8217;s protest movements around the world or
        in history particularly inspiring?<\/strong><\/p>\n
        <p>
          &#8220;There are so many instances of women\u2019s protest that
          inspire me consistently. At the moment I\u2019ve been reading about
          the experiences of <a
          href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Assata_Shakur\">Assata
          Shakur<\/a> and <a
          href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Angela_Davis\">Angela
          Davis<\/a>, and find myself inspired by their unrelenting power (and
          their incredible writing!). <\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          &#8220;I am inspired by the endurance of the women at <a
          href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/2011\/09\/08\/revolting-women-greenham-common\/\">Greenham
          Common<\/a>, and the physical strength of the four women who <a
          href=\"http:\/\/www.cultureshop.org\/details.php?code=SEEDS\">destroyed
          a Hawk fighter jet with hammers<\/a> that was being sold by the
          British government to East Timor to be used in the government\u2019s
          illegal occupation of the country. I also recall an image of a row of
          Zapatista women standing in line with their faces covered but still
          wearing these incredible bright dresses &#8211; and that image alone
          inspires me. But closer to home, I am inspired by the women close to
          me and the support we provide for each other.&#8221;<\/p>\n

              hashtags aren\u2019t worth anything &#8211; that\u2019s how UK
              Uncut started! But my advice to anyone nervous to get involved
              would be that anything that is worth fighting for is going to be a
              little scary, so that\u2019s even more reason to give it a go.
              It\u2019s scary because there is so much at stake. The kind of
              action UK Uncut takes is a great way to get involved. It\u2019s
              fun and creative and there is always space for people to choose
              their own style of action, and meet other people who share the
              same views.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              &#8220;Although other types of protest can be effective, I believe
              that direct action is necessary in any situation where other
              avenues have been exhausted and shut down. And that is the
              situation we are in now. For example, the reforms the NHS is
              facing weren\u2019t in the Conservative or the Lib Dem manifesto,
              and this coalition government is not even acting on behalf of the
              majority vote. So how is it fair that these radical changes are
              being made to a health service that Britain should be so proud of
              achieving, but is instead determined to destroy, without a say
              from the public who use it? <\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              &#8220;The leaders in charge of pushing through the bill do not
              have the population\u2019s interests at heart, are not interested
              in what we want or what we have to say. But this is our NHS
              &#8211; we rely on it, and we must protect it.&#8221; <\/p>\n

                  &#8220;The groups organising actions every week across the

                      it is voted on again, and we have one last chance to show
                      that we won\u2019t lose our health service. So join UK
