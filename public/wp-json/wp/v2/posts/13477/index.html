            Released in 1989, Disney\u2019s\u00a0<strong
              >The Little Mermaid<\/strong> heralded the start of the
              \u2018Disney Renaissance\u2019 \u2013 a period of critical and
              commercial success that followed a rocky patch where the
              studio\u2019s prime focus had been on Disneyland attractions
              rather than feature films.<\/p>\n

                target=\"_blank\">Broadway golden boy Howard Ashman<\/a>, who
                changed the planned English butler crab into a Jamaican
                crustacean named Sebastian, and reworked the film\u2019s
                structure to more closely align with that of a Broadway musical.
                He also decided to base Ursula the Sea Witch on drag artist and
