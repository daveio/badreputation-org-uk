  A short while ago I made <a

  short post<\/a> talking up the <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.theredpumpproject.org\/\"><strong
    >Red Pump Project<\/strong><\/a>. I was really pleased that the lovely
    people at the Project actually saw my shoutout, and stopped by to say hello,
    hoping that in the run up to March 10, which is National Women &amp;
    Girls&#8217; HIV Awareness Day over in the USA, we&#8217;d share some photos
    of ourselves rocking red shoes as a gesture of solidarity.<\/p>\n
    <p>
      This post is delivering on that request &#8211; I got several of our mixed
      gender team on board, so you can see some of our feet here rocking various
      shapes and styles of red shoe from the subtle to the spaceboot. (Yeah,
      those are mine. I have no taste and proudly revel in it.)<\/p>\n

      issue and our own battle to save our National Health Service. I have much
      less know-how about HIV in the USA, so I&#8217;ve bolted on some UK-based

                    \/>In that post I made I talked about the importance of
                    awareness\/prevention campaigns not using a kind of shock
                    tactic to alienate and stigmatise people living with HIV.
                    Without going too deeply into UK\/USA healthcare provision
                    comparisons, initiatives like the RPP (excepting the <a
                    href=\"http:\/\/www.nat.org.uk\">NAT<\/a>-spearheaded
                    fundraising drives pre-World AIDS Day) don&#8217;t feel so
                    common over here. Perhaps because we assume the NHS will
                    carry our HIV testing and awareness needs, but also because
                    services who do take a non-discriminatory approach, like <a
                    href=\"http:\/\/www.positiveeast.org.uk\/\">Positive
                    East<\/a> and the Terrence Higgins Trust are very much up
                    against Tory cuts just now. Unfortunately, this dovetails
                    with the fact that the NHS is facing &#8220;reforms&#8221;
                    that threaten to stitch it up like a free market kipper, so
                    in drumming up awareness for the RPP I guess I&#8217;d also
                    like to talk briefly about the importance of trying, in the
                    UK, to both appreciate the gravity of our own situation, and
                    the commonalities between the areas the RPP is concentrating
                    on &#8211; urban districts where people just aren&#8217;t
                    talking or thinking openly or inclusively about HIV &#8211;
                    and UK equivalents. HIV affects so many people that a lot of
                    UK feminists simply don&#8217;t see it as a specific enough
                    issue, but the thing is, it often interacts with more
                    commonly accepted feminist issues such as contraception,
                    sexual assault, and so on in complex and &#8211; as far as
                    the feminist blogosphere is concerned &#8211; markedly
                    under-analysed ways.<\/p>\n
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    HIV transmission rates, access to support services, and the
                    level of stigma faced by people living with it, all
                    intersect with, and are influenced by, cuts to <a
                    href=\"http:\/\/www.publications.parliament.uk\/pa\/cm201011\/cmpublic\/legalaid\/memo\/la19.htm\">advocacy<\/a>,
                    <a
                    href=\"http:\/\/www.myhiv.org.uk\/Your-rights\/Benefits\/Benefit-cuts\">disability
                    benefits<\/a>, education and healthcare services. And when
                    the latter are in play to the level they currently are in
                    Britain, they mean that existing social inequalities get
                    very heavily underscored. Stigma around living with HIV then
                    gets worse, and this underscores inequalities even further,
                    and you get a snake-chew-tail plughole situation. Stigma is
                    very often doled out in inherently gendered terms, with a
                    load of harmful assumptions about what kind of woman or man
                    would be likely to contract or transmit the virus, so not
                    engaging with it feeds more general problems of racism,
                    homophobia and gendered prejudice. As far as I&#8217;m
                    concerned this makes it very much a feminist issue in the
                    same way that issues of poverty, class and <a
                    href=\"http:\/\/www.naz.org.uk\/\">race<\/a> are, and indeed
                    these areas are all affected by HIV in complex ways which
                    keep people in disadvantaged groups one step removed from
                    the care they need, and have a right to access.<\/p>\n

                    feminists or otherwise, are receiving the information and
                    discussion they need and deserve on this issue, so
                    I&#8217;ll always come out loudly shouting for a project
                    like the RPP which encourages a discussion which takes into
                    account the intersections of gender, race and class and
                    their impact on HIV issues.<\/p>\n

                                Society alternative&#8221; or in any way an
                                oppositional model to a free national health
                                service. Some NHS Trusts in the UK work in
                                partnership with community-specific schemes such
                                as, for example, the Terrence Higgins Lighthouse
                                projects &#8211; a fact <a

                                Having both is generally not a bad idea. I would
