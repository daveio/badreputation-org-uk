  this collection of posts has centred on exceptional individuals who\u2019ve
  done unique things and make for fascinating stories. However, whilst it\u2019s
  great to give these figures the attention they deserve, and maybe to take some
  inspiration from their stories, the flow of events rarely rests on the actions
  of just one person. Lasting change is brought about by the ongoing work of
  countless people fighting for it on a daily basis.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  This post, then, is about those people; people who are getting on with the
  everyday business of making change happen. That ranges from people who work in
  charities, NGOs, and support organisations; people who lobby and campaign; and
  people who are acting on the change they\u2019d like to see in their
  interactions with the people around them.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  So here, then, are just some of the many organisations run by awesome people,
  doing awesome things on a daily basis.<\/p>\n
</p>
<ul>
  \n
  <li>
    \n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.africanfeministforum.com\/\">African Feminist
    Forum<\/a> \u2013 They run biennial conferences for feminist activists in
    Africa, and make efforts to include the voices of groups often marginalised
    within African feminism (and arguably feminist movements in many countries)
    \u2013 commercial sex workers, women with disabilities, and bisexual rights
    activists.<\/li>\n
  </li>
  <li>
    \n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.cawn.org\/\">Central American Women\u2019s
    Network<\/a> \u2013 They\u2019re working to improve the political, social
    and cultural rights of women in Central America through advocacy and
    campaigning, and raising awareness in the UK and US. Freedoms in Honduras
    have been a particular issue since the coup d\u2019etat of 2009.<\/li>\n
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wbg.org.uk\/\">Women\u2019s Budget Group<\/a>\u00a0
    &#8211; Based in the UK, they&#8217;re bringing gender analysis to economic
    policy, because it\u2019s hard to work for an equal society when the vast
    impact of government expenditure is skewed in favour of one portion of the
    population.<\/li>\n
  </li>
  <li>
    \n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bihr.org.uk\/\">British Insitute of Human
    Rights<\/a> \u2013 Because human rights for everyone is very much a feminist
    issue, and the BIHR are one of several fantastic groups supporting that.
    (See also: <a
    href=\"http:\/\/www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk\/index.php\">Liberty<\/a>,
    <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amnesty.org.uk\/\">Amnesty
    International<\/a>)\n\t<\/li>\n
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rota.org.uk\/pages\/default.aspx\">Race On The
    Agenda<\/a> \u2013 Too often the history of feminist discussion has been
    marred by an unfortunate exclusion of the voices from often-marginalised
    groups such as the Black and Asian communities. ROTA are one of the
    organisations helping to keep things more inclusive.<\/li>\n
  </li>
  <li>
    \n<a
    href=\"http:\/\/www.thepowerhouse.org.uk\/Powersite\/sitemap.htm\">Powerhouse<\/a>
    \u2013 Women with disabilities are another group that\u2019s been too often
    pushed to one side or rendered invisible. Run &#8220;by and for women with
    learning disabilities&#8221;, Powerhouse bring focus to this.\n<\/li>\n
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href=\"http:\/\/feministlibrary.co.uk\/\">The Feminist Library<\/a>
    \u2013 Libraries are basically the most awesome things ever, and this one
    carries a huge stock of feminist literature. It should hardly need
    explaining why this is an entire industrial-sized vat of pure
    brilliance.<\/li>\n
  </li>
  <li>
    \nThe Survivor Project \u2013 I want to include these folk, because judging
    from what I&#8217;ve read they\u2019re awesome, but unfortunately they seem
    to be without a website currently, so, er, you&#8217;ll have to find them
    yourselves later. They\u2019re a non-profit working against domestic and
    sexual violence against anyone, but with a particular focus on trans* and
    intersex survivors. It\u2019s an issue that\u2019s all too often ignored in
    the mainstream. (If in the future a website becomes available, hopefully
    we&#8217;ll be able to draw attention to it.)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n
    <p>
      This list isn\u2019t even remotely exhaustive, and couldn\u2019t possibly
      hope to be. There are more people out there working to support good ideas
      than I have any chance of adequately enumerating here. The fact that I can
      only post a tiny, miniscule example of some of the many groups and
      organisations involved in this is, honestly, brilliant. It\u2019d be a
      worrying sign if every beneficial organisation could be summed up in the
      space of one post. For more comprehensive overviews of the groups out
      there though, do check the members list for the <a
      href=\"http:\/\/www.wrc.org.uk\/membership\/members_listing\/default.aspx\">Women\u2019s
      Resource Centre<\/a> and the <a
      href=\"http:\/\/www.nawo.org.uk\/id6.html\">National Alliance of
      Women\u2019s Organisations<\/a>. (Of course, that only covers groups based
      at least partially in the UK. The list gets even longer when we go
      global.)<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      And then of course there\u2019s the fact that the above list has only
      covered organisations, groups, and charities. We\u2019ve yet to even touch
      on the vast array of feminist bloggers, writers, artists, and others out
      there making their ideas visible. Or the yet wider group who don\u2019t
      have a public podium from which to spread their message but are engaged in
      thinking about, discussing and living with this as a part of their daily
      world view. <\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      What I\u2019m saying is that there\u2019s a lot of us, and the collective
      weight behind this set of ideas is formidable. And that\u2019s seven
      shades of kickass.<\/p>\n
