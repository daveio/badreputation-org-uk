  Exciting news! My very favourite film, <a
  href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Castle_in_the_Sky\"><strong
    >Laputa<\/strong><\/a> (aka
    <strong
      >Castle In The Sky<\/strong>) has just appeared on YouTube with its rare
      original English dub rather than the grotesque Disney version featuring
      James Van Der Beek. This is, of course, bad and wrong and you definitely
      shouldn&#8217;t go and watch it all.<\/p>\n

        \/><\/a>It&#8217;s the first <a
        href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Studio_Ghibli\">Studio
        Ghibli<\/a> film proper, and it&#8217;s a corker, containing two
        reasonably kickass female characters, a steam train chase, skypirates,
        magic crystals, airships, a mysterious floating city and some damn fine
        robots. It&#8217;s a sort of steampunk sci-fi ecofable. It even has a
        section set in what is clearly a parallel universe Welsh mining town,
        inspired by Hayao Miyazaki&#8217;s trip to Wales and interest in the
        miners&#8217; strike in the early 1980s.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli can generally be relied upon for more
        interesting and resourceful <a
        href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/film\/2011\/jul\/14\/studio-ghibli-arrietty-heroines\">heroines<\/a>
        than your average Disney or Pixar fodder, even if they are a bit, er
        identically similar. But in
        <strong
          >Laputa<\/strong> you can read the whole film as a condemnation of
          patriarchal power. Seriously \u2013 the government, the military and
          the monarchy line up against a girl and her male friend (who represent
          the future, protecting one another and fighting alongside each other
          as equals) and a band of pirates captained by a truly formidable
          woman.<\/p>\n
          <p>
            There is a bit of a science vs nature theme, but it&#8217;s not
            clear cut, as the pirates rely on technology as much as the military
            do. Technology and nature are shown to be in harmony in the great
            overgrown gardens of the ancient city of Laputa, tended for
            centuries by a solitary robot.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyway, back to the womens. Orphan Sheeta is the central character,
            and although she might at first seem more passive than the Ghibli
            girls to come in
            <strong
              >Spirited Away<\/strong>,
              <strong
                >My Neighbour Totoro<\/strong> and
                <strong
                  >Howl&#8217;s Moving Castle<\/strong>, she is quietly
                  courageous, getting in a fair bit of fighting, struggling,
                  attacking, escaping and running away. In the dramatic first
                  minutes of the film, for example, she acts boldly and bravely
                  and strikes out against her captors:<\/p>\n

                      <p>
                        It&#8217;s also worth bearing in mind that
                        <strong
                          >Laputa<\/strong> came out in 1986, and Sheeta
                          represented a fairly significant departure from your
                          average anime heroine at that point. As well as being
                          smart, resourceful and brave, Sheeta is powerful.
                          Interestingly, she inherits this power &#8211; in the
                          form of the &#8216;levitation stone&#8217;, a secret
                          true name and powerful magic spells &#8211; from her
                          mother.<\/p>\n
                          <p>
                            Although her counterpart, the headstrong Pazu,
                            styles himself as her protector, and does do a bit
                            of rescuing, the traditional gender roles are
                            blurred. Rebecca Johnson highlights this in her
                            essay <a

                            <p>
                              Even the role reversal displayed between Sheeta
                              and Pazu is prominent, questioning the notion of
                              gender roles that men and women take. For example,
                              Sheeta tries to protect Pazu after their initial
                              capture by the army, denying that she needs help.
                              In this instance, both characters are
                              &#8220;damsels in distress&#8221; since they are
                              both under the threat of the army. Instead of
                              taking on a traditional role as a damsel, Sheeta
                              takes on the male role of
                              protector.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n

                              There are also two scenes in which Pazu cooks for
                              them both, which is a little thing, but it makes
                              me happy. Go go\u00a0normalizing atypical gender

                              In the climactic scene they stand side by side,
                              holding hands as equals, and act together as their
                              (feminine) compassion compels them to an act of
                              terrific (masculine) violence and destruction in
                              which they sacrifice themselves for the greater

                              Dan. Here she is outsmarting, outfighting and

                                  My favourite bit is the way she discards her
                                  skirt when things start to kick off. Rebecca
                                  Johnson sees Dola as a particularly radical
                                  character in the context of the dominant
                                  social ideals of Japanese womanhood. As she
                                  says:<\/p>\n

                                    Dola treats the world around her as personal

                                    her family, a band of pirates, she is a take

                                    &#8220;okasan&#8221; which literally means

                                    house&#8221;. However, it is safe to assume
                                    that Dola, as her sons&#8217; captain, is
                                    far from being &#8220;the woman at the back
                                    of the house.&#8221; Really, Dola is defying
                                    the common stereotype of Japanese women
                                    because her success is not being measured in
                                    terms of the motherly and wifely
                                    capabilities by which many contemporary
                                    Japanese women are judged. The common
                                    Japanese phrase &#8220;women are weak but
                                    mothers are strong&#8221; is one-sided, and
                                    proved wrong by Dola. Her characterization
                                    and actions show that she is not only a
                                    strong mother but a smart and strong woman
                                    in her own regard too.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n

                                    For all her ferocity and ruthlessness, Dola
                                    does have a compassionate side and becomes
                                    deeply protective of the two orphans once
                                    they have proved themselves to her. <a

                                    has an interesting analysis of Dola&#8217;s
                                    shifting gender identity, although I
                                    don&#8217;t completely agree with it.<\/p>\n

                                    Even now the film fills me with wonder, and
                                    the original score and use of silence
                                    (intolerable to Disney, apparently) is full
                                    of beauty. It left a lasting impression, and
                                    is probably responsible for my interest in
                                    anime and manga, and certainly for my
                                    profound love of robots. And I reckon you
                                    could do a lot worse on the role model front
                                    than Sheeta and Dola.<\/p>\n<div
