              Fairy tales weren\u2019t always Disney cartoons. Once upon a time,
              they were part of an oral tradition passed down from mother to
              child, cautionary tales about the horrors that lurked in the
              woods, and the dangers of going off the path. They were much
              bloodier back then, much scarier, and with a lot more impact. Then
              along came the Brothers Grimm and Hans Anderson, and other men who
              liked writing things down and only wrote down what they liked. The
              fairy tales got sillier from there, cautionary tales without any
              of the blood and violence that made them worth paying heed to in
              the first place. They only got worse with Disney (though some of
              us love Disney movies, occasionally even with <a

              with a happily ever after. Modern authors have taken the sanitised
              narratives we were all told as kids, and twisted them, into
              something we recognise but appreciate in a very different way.
              They\u2019re still the stories we know, but not only has the blood
              and gore reappeared, they\u2019ve grown up in much the same way as
              our society has grown up. Rather than warning our children that
              they should stick to the route life\u2019s prepared for them, walk
              the road to happy marriage and 2.4 kids, they instead encourag
              stepping away from the traditional routes, rebelling against
              authority, and reclaiming traditional feminine roles which are
              often painted in a negative light. Or they tell grown-up stories
              about characters traditionally relegated to the most sanitised
              view of childhood. There are countless modern fables which also
              play much the same roles as traditional folk tales, from the
              insanely popular wizard kids of
              <strong
                >Harry Potter<\/strong> to fables shrouded in mystery and played
                on a concept album.<\/p>\n
                <p>
                  Through all of this, there\u2019s one book which, in my
                  opinion, has succeeded in reclaiming stories once used to
                  repress and control women (and by extension everyone else) to
                  a far greater extent than any other: Angela Carter\u2019s
                  <strong
                    >The Bloody Chamber<\/strong>. As Carter herself asserted,
                    the stories therein are not simply updated or
                    \u201cadult\u201d versions of the traditional stories (she
                    really hated this idea). Rather, they build on the essence
                    of the originals; not those set down by the likes of
                    Perrault, but the
                    <em
                      >original<\/em> stories, those told in the oral tradition.
                      From a linguistic or anthropological point of view,
                      it\u2019s a fascinating experiment: how would those
                      stories have evolved and changed over the years if the
                      game of Chinese whispers that is oral storytelling
                      hadn\u2019t been brought to a stop?<\/p>\n
                      <p>
                        The result, updated versions of Bluebeard, Beauty and
                        the Beast (twice), Puss In Boots, Snow White (kinda),
                        Red Riding Hood (two or three times), plus a vampire
                        story and a sort of<br \ />\nRed Riding Hood\/Alice
                        Through The Looking Glass amalgam, is a brilliantly
                        charged piece of work. Charged emotionally, through our
                        strongly forged connection to these stories; charged
                        sexually, through the transition of the stories from
                        cautionary tales to fables of teenage awakening; and
                        crammed with ideas and themes, many of which it\u2019s
                        fair to say would be beyond the young minds to which
                        these stories were once told. Instead of telling
                        children how to behave themselves, they tell adults how
                        not to behave themselves.<\/p>\n
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        As I mentioned above, the traditional versions of these
                        stories are very often about staying \u201con the
                        path\u201d, the course society sets for an individual
                        based on their gender and circumstances. Nowhere is this
                        more evident than in the traditional Red Riding Hood
                        story; a little girl follows a shortcut through the
                        woods, deviating from the way she\u2019s been told to
                        go, and as a result she and a matriarchal figure are
                        murdered by a vicious beast, or rescued by a male hero
                        who is otherwise absent from the story. In Carter\u2019s
                        versions, the little girl leaves the path, and the
                        rewards, while terrifying, are great. In

                          image of feral sexuality, with the adolescent Red
                          Riding Hood sleeping with him at the end. In<strong>
                            The Werewolf<\/strong>, Granny herself is the wolf;
                            a certain metaphor for how traditional ideas of the

                            kills her, and inherits all her stuff. In

                              the story with elements of

                                titular character emerges from a feral
                                childhood, not into the socialised womanhood
                                which the nuns taking care of her demand, but
                                instead redeeming the vampiric Duke in whose
                                care she is left by the power of her sexual
                                awakening.<\/p>\n
                                <p>
                                  Sexual power is a primary theme in many of the
                                  stories. Carter refutes the view of female
                                  sexuality as passive and submissive; such sex
                                  is presented as a sterile, pleasureless
                                  experience. The titular story, and also the
                                  longest, goes into this in detail with a
                                  version of the Bluebeard story set in the
                                  1930s. The narrator, also the heroine, marries
                                  the familiar murderer. Rather than merely
                                  dying, as in some versions of the fairy tale,
                                  or being rescued by a male saviour, it is her
                                  mother, a badass world-travelling tiger
                                  hunter, who comes to the rescue. The
                                  \u201csaviour male\u201d is replaced with a
                                  blind piano tuner who ultimately becomes the
                                  heroine\u2019s lover, taking the sexual
                                  emphasis away from the visual with which
                                  Bluebeard is so obsessed, and placing it
                                  firmly where it belongs: in the realm of the
                                  sensual.<\/p>\n

                                    primal power and strength rather than
                                    civilised control. Beauty is at first an
                                    object, a thing given to the Beast to repay
                                    a gambling debt. It\u2019s through her own
                                    acknowledgement and understanding of her
                                    bestial side that she claims freedom, and
                                    achieves her transformation, which in a
                                    reversal of the traditional fairy tale beast
                                    transformation is not a horrifying
                                    punishment, but a liberating reward.<\/p>\n

                                      In many ways, these stories aren\u2019t
                                      for children. They\u2019re complex
                                      narratives which many adults would
                                      struggle with. On the other hand, these
                                      stories, which challenge the expected
                                      ideas and cautionary tales of behaving
                                      like good girls and boys, are in a way
                                      exactly what we should be telling our
                                      kids: there are terrible things out there,
