    <p>
      It&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve bought a paper comic. <a
      href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/2011\/08\/08\/comics-i-have-known-and-loved\/\"
      target=\"_blank\">I was deeply in love with comics at one point in my
      life<\/a>. I swore off them a while ago for reasons of both taste &#8211;
      I&#8217;d run out of titles with female characters that I was interested
      in &#8211; and budget: it was one too many expensive habits for a theatre
      professional, and in the end, red wine won the day.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      I&#8217;ve kept a weather eye on the comics world, and the announcement of
      an all-female line-up for
      <strong
        >X-Men<\/strong> was enough to send me to Forbidden Planet. But what
        made me actually buy the thing despite the \u00a33 price tag was writer
        <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brianwood.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Brian
        Wood<\/a> (<strong

                  <strong
                    >JLA Earth 2<\/strong>, which all sit beautiful and bold on
                    my shelves thanks in part to her palette choices and ability
                    to make heroes look truly heroic).<\/p>\n
                    <p>
                      Marvel introduce the issue <a
                      href=\"http:\/\/comicstore.marvel.com\/X-Men-1\/digital-comic\/29419\"
                      target=\"_blank\">on their website<\/a> as follows:<\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p>
                        Because you demanded it! The X-Women finally get their
                        own book!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        So, a fan-based revolution in the world of comics?
                        Perhaps. The title is part of Marvel NOW, the 2012
                        relaunch of the brand aiming to bring new readers into
                        the market, or in my case, perhaps to bring readers back
                        into the fold and into comic stores.<\/p>\n
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Could it be that the comic industry is\u00a0 tackling
                        the gap in the market for mainstream titles that are
                        interesting to women? I&#8217;m heartened by the weight
                        put behind this comic; it doesn&#8217;t seem to be a
                        gimmick or an afterthought. The issue was heavily
                        trailed with an <a

                        hard not to notice. And what I&#8217;ve also been
                        interested to note is the supportive voices around the
                        line-up, with <a

                        launch as an opportunity to dedicate space to interviews
                        with women in the industry, and to the importance of

                                    The series features an all-female team
                                    including Storm, Jubilee, Rogue, Kitty
                                    Pryde, Rachel Grey (daughter of Scott and
                                    Jean) and Psylocke. They&#8217;re based at
                                    Jean Grey&#8217;s School for the Gifted and
                                    pitted against runaway trains, teenage
                                    tantrums in the hallway, and the arrival of
                                    John Sublime with a request for help.<\/p>\n
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                    I&#8217;m very pleased to see Storm&#8217;s
                                    mowhawk back in business, and Jubilee was
                                    always a favourite of mine from the <a
                                    href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/X-Men_%28TV_series%29\">TV
                                    series<\/a>, even if she was often cast as a
                                    mutant girl version of <a
                                    href=\"http:\/\/thundercats.wikia.com\/wiki\/Snarf\">Snarf.<\/a>
                                    She spoke to me of teenage wish-fulfilment,
                                    her mutant power always waiting in the wings
                                    for the right moment to shine, exactly like
                                    mine. Except my mutant power hasn&#8217;t
                                    developed yet. I&#8217;m sure it
                                    will.<\/p>\n
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                    What&#8217;s good about it? Lots. Lots and
                                    lots. The storyline moves on nicely, with a
                                    strong introduction that sets up future
                                    intrigue. It&#8217;s issue one, so
                                    I&#8217;ve not got a lot to go on, but so
                                    far it feels well-paced and with good action
                                    scenes and themes of homecoming (positive
                                    and negative) alongside the usual
                                    &#8220;outsider&#8221; politics that have
                                    always been a solid foundation for
                                    mutant-related plot.<\/p>\n
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                    The main characters get set up nicely and
                                    all showcase their abilities, personalities
                                    and range of powers. Jubilee and Kitty are
                                    set at a similar age and look like they are
                                    set to play out the roles of younger,
                                    naive\/vulnerable characters, although there
                                    are two pupils at the school who look like
                                    they might also fill that position, so
                                    we&#8217;ll see. In terms of more
                                    experienced or older figures, Storm takes
                                    centre stage on the cover and is the team
                                    leader and headmistress with Rachel Grey as
                                    her second-in-command. Rogue is the
                                    powerhouse, and is shown enjoying herself
                                    being gung-ho in saving the day during a
                                    classic runaway train sequence, whilst
                                    Psylocke is pleasingly intimidating in the
                                    role of bad cop when Rachel interviews John
                                    Sublime.<\/p>\n

                                        I can&#8217;t write this review without
                                        talking about how the characters look,
                                        partly because comics are a visual
                                        medium, but also because it&#8217;s so
                                        good to see a lot of the traditional
                                        problems of female representation
                                        overturned here. We have two non-white
                                        characters in the line-up, neither of

                                        in the words of a friend of mine, seems
                                        to have developed a secondary mutation

                                        that the instances of female characters
                                        doing needlessly sexy poses is fairly
                                        low, but having passed the issue around
                                        a few friends (male and female) the
                                        mileage varies. That said, it&#8217;s
                                        certainly way below what I would have

                                          writer and artist that it would have
                                          been good to see a character who
                                          subverted traditional expectations of
                                          what heroic women in comics should
                                          look like. A woman with the glorious
                                          curves of Morrison&#8217;s Angel
                                          Salvadore before she got reworked into
                                          a &#8220;prettier&#8221; version.
                                          Similarly, it&#8217;s a shame not to
                                          have an older female character to give
                                          something of the sagacity of Professor
                                          Xavier (can we make Helen Mirren a
                                          mutant already?), not to mention the
                                          fact that without him and without
                                          Cyclops the line-up could perhaps be
                                          seen as somewhat ableist compared to
                                          other line-ups.<\/p>\n

                                            weren&#8217;t an engaging start that
                                            has me hooked, it has already done
                                            an awful lot to show what female
                                            superheroes can do when well-written
                                            and well-drawn: tell a fantastic
                                            story that makes you wish your
                                            mutant powers would hurry up and

                                            change and a step in the right
                                            direction for the future of comics?
                                            I hope so. But I&#8217;m hedging my
                                            bets, just in case I&#8217;m once
                                            again entirely cut off from my

                                            pretty well &#8211; more on that in
