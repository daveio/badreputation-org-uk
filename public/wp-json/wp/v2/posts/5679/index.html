          target=\"_blank\">musical film<\/a> of the same name as a tomboy, gets
          humiliated and learns to be a girl, then gets married. In a dress and

            Proud and tomboyish \u2018Calam\u2019 is a popular and respected
            figure in the town of Deadwood. Not just one of the boys, but
            determined to outshoot, outdrink, outswagger them all. But
            she&#8217;s met her match in Wild Bill Hickok whom she admires and
            who grudgingly admires her, although they get into one of those

            Calam\u2019s in love with the local Lieutenant Danny, and saves his
            life, but he\u2019s not interested in her. Because he\u2019s a dick,

            Anyway, a Proper Lady (Katie) comes to town and becomes friends with
            Calam, helping her discover her feminine side (I know, I know, just
            bear with me) and Bill falls unconvincingly in love with her. But
            when Danny and Katie are discovered KISSING, Calam loses it and
            threatens to run Katie out of town. She makes a right fool of
            herself, and Danny is mean about her, but Bill Hickok defends her
            and goes to console\/talk some sense into a bereft Calam. On a still
            summer night, in a wood, under a silvery moon, etc\u2026 they kiss,
            and conveniently enough it turns out they\u2019ve been in love all
            along! Everyone makes friends again, Calam marries Bill and Katie
            marries Danny, even though he\u2019s a knob.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            Okay. So there are some tough bits, most notably the repeated
            references to \u201cfemale thinking\u201d, and the godawful <a
            title=\"YouTube - A Woman's Touch\"
            href=\"http:\/\/youtu.be\/swYl_rFe7Qk\" target=\"_blank\"><strong
              >A Woman\u2019s Touch<\/strong><\/a> song. I get through this by
              donning slash goggles, through which it all becomes rather
              charming and ironic.<\/p>\n
              <p>
                There\u2019s even a symbolic castration of Calam at the end when
                she and Bill get married \u2013 they\u2019re just getting on the
                stagecoach and he finds she has her gun tucked into her wedding
                dress. They all laugh and he hands it to some random in the
                crowd. Then they ride off singing etc.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                BUT. There is a lot that is loveable about this film, and
                it\u2019s not as bad as the details above might suggest.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                Firstly, Doris Day\u2019s Calam is a wonderful character. Brave,
                kind, funny and bursting with energy, she leaps about all over
                the place, and has a habit of firing at the ceiling to get
                people\u2019s attention. She\u2019s a tomboy but she\u2019s no
                freak \u2013 everyone in the town is fond of her, respects her
                and humours her habit of exaggerating her own exploits.
                She\u2019s accepted, not just tolerated. Her flaw is her pride,
                and the real point of the story is that it\u2019s her pride
                which is \u2018corrected\u2019 and not her masculine
                habits.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                Secondly, although she is engirlied, she doesn\u2019t become a
                50s fembot. She wears a few dresses, but mostly she\u2019s out
                of her buckskins yet still in trousers. There\u2019s no sign at
                all she\u2019s going to give up riding the stage (or violently
                oppressing the indigenous population). I think my favourite bit
                in the whole film is near the end when she\u2019s racing after
                Katie\u2019s coach to bring her back to Deadwood, and she passes
                Bill and his mate on her horse. She thunders past, then stops,
                turns, rides back, kisses him, and rides off again without a
                word.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                His friend says \u201cI don&#8217;t know what kind of life
                you&#8217;ll have living with that catamount&#8230; but it
                ain&#8217;t gonna be dull.\u201d<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                Bill replies: \u201cThat&#8217;s for dang sure.\u201d He looks
                delighted.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                Thirdly, although it arrives at a supremely convenient time in
                that way that musicals have, the relationship between Calam and
                Bill is a convincing one. Throughout the film there are
                references to their friendship and campaigns together, and they
                are clearly fond of each other. He sticks up for her when Danny
                is being disparaging, and tells her early on he thinks
                she\u2019d be pretty (if she was a Proper Lady, natch). So when
                Calamity \u2018takes off her glasses\u2019 at the Ball (in fact
                she\u2019s been covered up in a coat she claims was given to her
                by General Custer) it isn\u2019t as if he\u2019s only just
                noticed her. And crucially, rather than trying to put her down
                or get her to act in a more feminine way, his efforts are about
                bringing her down to earth from her flights of fancy and
                towering pride.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                It\u2019s not a feminist film. It\u2019s not even
                <em
                  >close<\/em>. But Calamity is wonderful, and I think better a
                  film with her in it than not at all.<\/p>\n
