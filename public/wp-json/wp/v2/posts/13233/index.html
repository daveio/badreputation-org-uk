                  \/><\/a>For a stylish, slinky and subversive depiction of a
                  bloodsucker,
                  <strong
                    >Daughters of Darkness<\/strong> (directed by Harry
                    K\u00fcmel, 1971) is well worth a look. It\u2019s a hypnotic
                    cocktail of horror and arthouse. The DVD has a campy
                    Hammer-style cover and the tag line, \u2018An erotic
                    nightmare of vampire lust!\u2019 Subtle. For some reason,
                    there were a lot of lesbian vampire movies released in the
                    70s. However anyone looking for straight-up naughtiness will
                    be disappointed with
                    <strong
                      >Daughters of Darkness<\/strong>. The vampires are
                      beautiful women, but it\u2019s not about titillation.
                      It\u2019s a lot weirder than that.<\/p>\n
                      <p>
                        The story: a pair of newlyweds arrive at an
                        out-of-season hotel in chilly Ostend. The bride \u2013
                        Valerie \u2013 is dressed all in white and appears to be
                        the picture of na\u00efve innocence. The groom \u2013
                        Stefan \u2013 has a handsome face, but there\u2019s
                        something not quite right about his smile. It almost
                        looks like a sneer.<\/p>\n
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Their relationship appears to be a bit, well, peculiar.
                        She\u2019s concerned that he hasn\u2019t told his mother
                        about their marriage. He seems to be in no hurry to do
                        so. Prior to their unscheduled stop-in at this beautiful
                        but lonely place, they have both confessed that they
                        don\u2019t love one another and both seem okay with
                        this. And then, during dinner, the sapphic vampire
                        aristocrat arrives with her assistant\/lover.<\/p>\n

                        The Countess Bathory, played with otherworldly grace and
                        just a hint of vulnerability by Delphine Seyrig, tells
                        the couple that she is a descendant of the infamously
                        murderous <a
                        href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Elizabeth_B%C3%A1thory\"

                        historical character and template for the
                        \u2018glamorous female vampire\u2019 archetype,
                        Elizabeth Bathory was supposed to have been a serial
                        killer but apparently wasn\u2019t really into drinking
                        virgins&#8217; blood. That was a rumour that came about
                        years after her death. The real Countess was never a
                        vampire, just as Catherine the Great probably never even
                        got to first base with any horses.)<\/p>\n
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Her loving description of the horrors her ancestor
                        inflicted on young ladies gets Stefan a bit excited.
                        Valerie is horrified. At first. And then the couple are
                        drawn into the vampire\u2019s world. In which the
                        notions of victim and monster get turned sideways. And
                        then the film briefly shows us Stefan\u2019s
                        \u2018Mother\u2019. (As the the none-more-seventies
                        voiceover man enthuses in the film\u2019s trailer,
                        \u2018She\u2019s something else!\u2019).<\/p>\n
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        And there are some deaths. Including death by
                        bowl.<\/p>\n
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Yes, bowl. And a lovely crystal bowl it is too. And
                        someone knocks an entire lobster on the floor in the
                        act. Such decadence! The film could be read as a
                        mediation on power and relationships. (In their own
                        ways, Countess Bathory and Stefan are both bullies.) Or
                        an exercise in playing around with genre tropes. Or a
                        daft-but-enjoyable confection of crazy featuring some
                        splendid outfits (sequins, feathers, PVC capes!).<\/p>\n
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Actually, it\u2019s probably a bit of all of these.
                        It\u2019s a strange and beautiful work. Even the bits
                        that make you snigger might crop up in your dreams a
                        long time after you\u2019ve seen it.<\/p>\n
