<p>
  Here we are, back again! This month has been fairly quiet for me on the gaming
  front as I&#8217;ve been blessed with the joy of Real World Things\u2122, but
  do not fret(!) &#8211; there&#8217;s still content for you in the form of
  <strong
    >Dear Esther<\/strong> (a brand new &#8211; sort of &#8211; game) and other
    old bits and pieces I&#8217;ve been pootling about with.<\/p>\n<div

    <h3>
      Dear Esther<\/h3>\n
      <p>
        <a title=\"Dear Esther website\" href=\"http:\/\/dear-esther.com\"
        target=\"_blank\">Dear Esther<\/a> was released through the Steam
        platform on February 14th this year as a standalone offering via <a
        title=\"The Chinese Room\" href=\"http:\/\/thechineseroom.co.uk\/\"
        target=\"_blank\">The Chinese Room<\/a>. This is not, however, the first
        incarnation of the innovative story-led first person; it began life four
        years ago as a mod for
        <strong
          >Half Life 2<\/strong>, and for its independent release it was
          supported by The Indie Fund, who <a title=\"Indie Fund: Dear Esther
          has reached profitability\"
          href=\"http:\/\/indie-fund.com\/2012\/02\/dear-esther-has-reached-profitability-it-took-5-hours-30-minutes\/\"
          target=\"_blank\">recouped their investment within five and a half
          hours<\/a> of the game going on sale (selling over 16,000 copies in
          the first 24 hours). Now, that&#8217;s pretty impressive for an
          extremely minimalist game in a market full of guns, cars, swords and
          big bad monsters!<\/p>\n
          <p>
            It&#8217;s \u00a36.99 here in the UK, which means it&#8217;ll be
            floating somewhere around the $10\/10\u20ac mark for other regions,
            but bear in mind it only has full audio support in English. As it
            was plastered all around Steam and was something new, interesting
            and completely different, I thought I&#8217;d give it a go &#8211;
            if nothing else I&#8217;d have a new release to tell you all about
            for once! My first attempted playthrough ended rather swiftly, late
            at night, after the game decided it didn&#8217;t want to listen to
            my keyboard commands.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            Never fear, I came back to it the next day after I&#8217;d had some
            sleep and my computer had been given a chance to think about what it
            had done. It worked fine the second time around. You start off by a
            lighthouse on an island somewhere in the Hebrides; the (male)
            voiceover begins to read excerpts from a letter (or letters),
            addressed to &#8220;Esther&#8221;.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            As you walk around the island, trying to find your way, he reads
            different excerpts at different points in the game. I&#8217;d go
            into much more detail, but as I finished the whole sequence in just
            over an hour, I wouldn&#8217;t want to spoil things for anyone yet
            to play it by discussing my theories. Instead, I&#8217;ll tell you
            about the atmosphere and the artwork, both of which are superb.
            You&#8217;re alone on a bleak island, battered by wind with no
            person or animal in sight save the odd seagull, and it is a sadly
            beautiful world.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            I found myself a little unnerved walking around, especially when I
            spotted a shadowy figure in the distance who, when I approached,
            disappeared (this happens twice). I think, in retrospect, that I was
            mostly spooked because I&#8217;d watched <a title=\"IMDB: The Woman
            in Black\" href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt1596365\/\"
            target=\"_blank\"><strong
              >The Woman in Black<\/strong><\/a> the day before and was still
              half-expecting some ghoulish face to pop up and scream at
              me.<\/p>\n
              <p>
                However, personally, I found
                <strong
                  >Dear Esther<\/strong> a little underwhelming considering the
                  hype it was garnering; I understand every compliment given to
                  it, but equally those amazing, clever, innovative bits are
                  altogether a bit too brief, especially at \u00a36.99 &#8211;
                  about 10 minutes per \u00a31 in my case. The art is great, the
                  story is great (if a little too easily guessed), the concept
                  is great and it is a brilliant injection of something
                  different into the market. It just would&#8217;ve been better
                  if the &#8216;value for money&#8217; factor was
                  improved.<\/p>\n
                  <p>
                    Apologies for the lack of feminist critique, but the only
                    thing that it could be faulted on there is the age-old
                    &#8220;Why is it always a bloke protagonist?&#8221;. Esther,
                    obviously, is hugely important to the entire game so
                    although she is absent, she is constantly present as she is
                    who you&#8217;re talking to &#8211; she is the one you love.
                    Still, indie game + male protagonist = not all that
                    innovative after all.<\/p>\n
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It&#8217;s a good game if you want to have some feelings,
                    think a bit and look at pretty Scottish scenery while under
                    no obligation to chase, fight or challenge anything. My only
                    advice would be to make sure you definitely don&#8217;t want
                    to use that \u00a37 on something that might last you a bit
                    longer.<\/p>\n

                      Apart from the above, I haven&#8217;t been up to much with
                      the sole exception being <a title=\"Wikipedia: Tekken 5

                        I dusted off the ol&#8217; PSP and have been button
                        bashing during my lunch breaks on my Saturday shifts.
                        I&#8217;ve also discovered I&#8217;ve lost all my
                        wicked-sick skills and keep getting K.O.&#8217;d by
                        rubbish opponents. It&#8217;s fun for portable
                        fight-based gaming and there&#8217;s a bowling minigame
                        too. It features the standard Arcade and Story modes as
                        well as the potential to PvP online. As it&#8217;s a)
                        old and b) PSP (now replaced by the Vita) it is pretty
                        cheap to buy &#8211; best bet is probably eBay though
                        &#8211; and presents a standard bit of amusement,
                        providing you can ignore the panty-flashing from almost
                        every single female fighter.<\/p>\n

                              expect a review on that once I&#8217;ve powered
                              through it, and hopefully I&#8217;ll be able to
                              say it&#8217;s improved on some of the downfalls
                              of the last game (which I explored many moons ago,
