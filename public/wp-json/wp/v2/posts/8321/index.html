  This weekend is Remembrance Sunday, and I\u2019ve been umming and ahhing as
  usual about whether to wear a <a

  poppy<\/a>\/a <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.ppu.org.uk\/whitepoppy\/index.html\">white poppy<\/a>\/no
  poppy. Whatever your personal poppy choice, I think most people would agree
  that there\u2019s value in the remembering.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  The memorialising of the First World War is long established and
  institutionalised, to the extent that no politician will be photographed
  poppyless. But remembrance can also be a deeply political, even radical act.
  Especially if you\u2019re remembering people that many would prefer to
  forget.<\/p>\n

        by other team members last year made me realise that it should have
        been.<\/p>\n
        <p>
          Why does it matter? As Gwendolyn Ann Smith of the Remembering Our Dead
          project puts it:<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            The Transgender Day of Remembrance serves several purposes. It
            raises public awareness of hate crimes against transgender people,
            an action that current media doesn\u2019t perform. Day of
            Remembrance publicly mourns and honors the lives of our brothers and
            sisters who might otherwise be forgotten. Through the vigil, we
            express love and respect for our people in the face of national
            indifference and hatred. Day of Remembrance reminds non-transgender
            people that we are their sons, daughters, parents, friends and
            lovers. Day of Remembrance gives our allies a chance to step forward
            with us and stand in vigil, memorializing those of us who\u2019ve
            died by anti-transgender violence.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n

            remembering which needs to be done. I\u2019m a big gender history
            nerd, and although I&#8217;ve spent years reading about changing
            gender roles and expectations; women in history; gay, lesbian and
            bisexual history, there\u2019s are gaps in my knowledge around the
            experiences and heritage of the transgender community.<\/p>\n

                Recording, recognising and remembering the histories of
                marginalised groups might seem like an academic endeavour, but
                it has a vital political function. The stories of transgender,
                gay and bi people, of disabled people, of women, of ethnic and
                religious minorities, of the poor, have been both accidentally
                and deliberately erased over the centuries. By remembering, we
                can restore these missing voices to history, and we have
                ammunition when we\u2019re told that x behaviour or y social
                group is a modern scourge, that they\u2019re unnatural or
                against tradition, or that this is the way things have always
                been.<\/p>\n
