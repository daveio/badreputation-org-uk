    try and tour all the issues around women and HIV and AIDS, partly because

        So why am I writing this at all? Over the last nine months I\u2019ve
        gotten interested in the interactions between violence against women,
        gender roles and HIV, which I confess is mostly down to my job at <a
        href=\"http:\/\/www.womankind.org.uk\/\"><strong
          >Womankind Worldwide<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n
          <p>
            It struck me that even though I\u2019ve been working with different
            organisations tackling violence against women in the UK for years, I
            don\u2019t remember HIV ever being mentioned. It\u2019s just not
            something I\u2019d ever really thought about. But then, I had also
            failed to really think about, you know, the rest of the world. This
            job has been an eye-opener, and I heartily encourage other feminists
            in the UK, the US, and Western Europe to look up and see what\u2019s
            happening in the places you <a
            href=\"http:\/\/www.ibt.org.uk\/research_snapshots\/snapshot_5.php\">don\u2019t
            see on TV<\/a>.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            \u201cThis epidemic unfortunately remains an epidemic of
            women,\u201d Michel Sidib\u00e9, Executive Director of <a
            href=\"http:\/\/www.unaids.org\/en\/\">UNAIDS<\/a> said in 2010. At
            the end of 2009, women accounted for just over half of all adults
            living with HIV worldwide. In some areas of the world the proportion
            is much higher, for example in sub-Saharan Africa it is 60%. High
            levels of HIV among women in these areas are both caused by and
            causes of violence against women.<\/p>\n

            Violence, HIV and Women&#8217;s Health<\/h3>\n
            <p>
              Violence against women (you remember, that <a
              href=\"http:\/\/endviolence.un.org\/situation.shtml\">really
              prevalent<\/a> thing that occurs in all countries in the world)
              interacts with the HIV epidemic in several cheery ways. This
              paraphrased from a World Health Organisation <a
              href=\"http:\/\/www.who.int\/gender\/violence\/vawandhiv\/en\/\">briefing<\/a>:<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <ul>
              \n
              <li>
                Sexual abuse in childhood is associated with risk-taking
                behaviour later in life, increasing an individual\u2019s
                lifetime risk of contracting HIV.<\/li>\n
              </li>
              <li>
                Rape exposes women to HIV, and the chances of a woman
                contracting HIV via a forced sexual encounter are probably
                increased due to the physical trauma.<\/li>\n
              </li>
              <li>
                Violence and fear of violence can stop a woman insisting on
                condom use or refusing unwanted sex, leaving her with no means
                of protecting themselves.<\/li>\n
              </li>
              <li>
                Fear of violence, abandonment or stigma can dissuade women from
                learning their status or from sharing it with their partners,
                and can also effect HIV control, treatment, and programmes
                aiming to prevent mother to child transmission.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n
                <p>
                  Women&#8217;s health has been the subject of more discussion
                  in development circles in recent years, thanks in large part
                  to the Millennium Development Goals, one of which (<a
                  href=\"http:\/\/www.un.org\/millenniumgoals\/maternal.shtml\">MDG5<\/a>)
                  is focused on maternal health. Women\u2019s health
                  doesn\u2019t begin and end with children though, so I\u2019ve
                  been pleased to see greater recognition of the impact of
                  gender-based violence appearing under <a
                  href=\"http:\/\/www.un.org\/millenniumgoals\/aids.shtml\">MDG6<\/a>,
                  which is dedicated to ending the spread of diseases including
                  HIV infection and the associated illnesses it can cause. Next
                  step, an MDG which is focused on reducing levels of violence
                  against women? Something which has a pretty damaging effect on
                  women&#8217;s health in its own right.<\/p>\n

                  Ghana<\/h3>\n
                  <p>
                    Through work recently I was lucky enough to meet some of the
                    women and men fighting to reduce violence against women and
                    women\u2019s vulnerability to HIV infection in rural Ghana.
                    Although Ghana isn\u2019t the country worst affected by the
                    HIV epidemic, of the 240,000 HIV+ adults living in Ghana,
                    almost 60% are women. Women in Ghana also experience high
                    levels of violence: 1 in 3 women has experienced some form
                    of physical violence in their lifetime, and 20% of women
                    report that they first experienced sex against their will.
                    (<a title=\"Womankind, Ghana\"
                    href=\"http:\/\/www.womankind.org.uk\/what-we-do\/where-we-work\/ghana\/\"
                    target=\"_blank\">Stats<\/a>)<\/p>\n
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In addition there are a number of harmful traditional
                    practices that contribute to the spread of HIV among women,
                    as well as the cultural acceptability of men having several
                    partners and the right to demand sex. Traditional practices,
                    such as widow inheritance (where a widow is forced to marry
                    her dead husband\u2019s relative), or polygyny (22% of
                    married women are in polygynous unions) increase the
                    likelihood of contracting HIV.<\/p>\n
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Women living with HIV or AIDS in Ghana also face enormous
                    stigma and go to <a
                    href=\"http:\/\/www.womankind.org.uk\/2011\/05\/the-long-walk-home-how-hiv-infected-women-in-ghana-seeking-support-will-go-to-any-lengths-to-avoid-exposure\/\">extraordinary
                    lengths<\/a> to find support and keep their status secret.
                    One reason is that <a
                    href=\"http:\/\/afrol.com\/articles\/35770\">belief in
                    witchcraft is widespread<\/a>, and HIV infection or death
                    from AIDS-defining illnesses is sometimes blamed on the
                    malign influence of a witch. Incidentally if you\u2019re

                        local and global communities. Part of that change is
                        recognition of the complex interactions between HIV and
                        AIDS and violence against women, and the need for
