Diary of a Female Petrolhead"},"content":{"rendered":"
<p>
  I have a confession to make: I&#8217;m not actually a petrolhead. Not even a
  little bit. I didn&#8217;t play with cars as a little girl, and I didn&#8217;t
  go to track days with my father. I never learned to drive, and wouldn&#8217;t
  have been able to tell the <a
  href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crankshaft\">crankshaft<\/a> from the
  water pump even if you held a gun to my head.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  At least, that was the case three months ago. I\u2019m not going to go into
  the many and varied reasons why, sitting on the sofa one November weekend, I
  decided that I wanted to know more about cars. Suffice to say that maybe I was
  going a little house-crazy from being stuck indoors with the flu.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>So I decided I was going to rebuild an engine.<\/p>\n</p>
<p>
  This is a difficult and challenging task if you\u2019ve worked with cars all
  your life. It is nigh on impossible if you can\u2019t tell your <a
  href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Piston\">pistons<\/a> from your <a
  href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Poppet_valve\">poppets<\/a>. I also
  decided I was going to learn how to drive. This, too, would be a challenge, as
  the last time I\u2019d been behind the wheel of a car had been twelve years
  ago. My father decided that, as I was seventeen and had my newly-minted
  provisional license in my pocket, the best thing to do for my first hour in
  the driver\u2019s seat would be to take me out in London rush hour and make me
  practise three-point turns and parallel parking. After miraculously not
  killing anyone, I swore that I\u2019d never get behind the wheel again.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  The other major drawback is that my father was an engineer and a mechanic. He
  had engineering for his work, and mechanics for his hobby. You can imagine
  what his reaction would be if one of his children finally &#8211; finally!
  &#8211; showed an interest in anything remotely mechanical. Even if it was the
  girl.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  Obviously, you can\u2019t just walk off and buy yourself an engine. Well,
  actually, you can, but there\u2019s not much point. First off, you have to
  work out where you\u2019re going to keep it. There\u2019s a useful space in
  the back garden, and I\u2019ve measured for tarp, engine stand, and general
  manoeuvrability. It will, I am told, be sufficient.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  Then, you have to come to terms with the fact that you\u2019re building an
  engine, not a car. There\u2019s no space to keep a clapped-out old banger in
  suburban London, and I\u2019m not about to shell out for a garage for no
  apparent reason. The downside is that my beautiful rebuilt engine will never
  be seen in action. The upside is that I am far less likely to explode myself
  and the neighbours.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  Thirdly, you\u2019re going to need to get some tools and learn about engines.
  And therein lies the rub. Have you ever tried to find a general mechanics
  course? Have you? I have. There are two choices:<\/p>\n
</p>
<ol>
  \n
  <li>Full-time year-long course leading to an NVQ or equivalent;<\/li>\n</li>
  <li>
    How to not explode your car when changing the oil.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n
    <p>
      OK, so they weren\u2019t terribly suitable. How about a textbook? I used
      to be an academic, I\u2019m good with textbooks. Well \u2013<\/p>\n

              <p>
                After wishlisting the first and stabbing my eyes out over the
                second, I decided that textbooks may be all well and good, but
                what I really needed was an opportunity to take the damn thing
                apart myself. (Yes, I was the child that disassembled all my
                toys to see how they worked.) Unfortunately, in order to do
                that\u2026 Yup, I was back at square one.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                Despondent, I complained about this Catch 22 to a colleague of
                mine, who had been making similar noises about getting a little
                fed up of being pushed into a knitting club or
                daisy-counting-clique. What she really wanted, she said, was to
                mess about with something a little more robust, like an
                engine\u2026<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                So. We\u2019ve measured the back garden. We\u2019ve ordered
                appropriate textbooks and acquired a couple of Haynes manuals.
                We\u2019ve ordered a model engine to get a rough idea of how
                this all works. I\u2019ve signed up for driving lessons in the
                vain hope that I can overcome my car phobia.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                And then, once the sun comes out, we\u2019re going to lay down
                the tarp and set up the engine stand, and buy a crappy
                clapped-out engine off eBay for 50p and take it apart.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                I\u2019m not going to tell my father a word about all of this. I
                have a horrible feeling that he will be so delighted that I have
                finally come around that he will decide to show me how to do it
                \u2018properly\u2019. Where my teachers failed to instil any
                interest in me at age 12, I am hoping that my own interest at
                age 29 will bear out and let me stick with it.<\/p>\n<p
