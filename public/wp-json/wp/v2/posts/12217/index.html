  Yesterday found me flicking through a copy of the relaunched\u00a0<a

    >Company<\/strong><\/a>\u00a0magazine looking for emergency blogpost
    inspiration (or &#8220;inspo&#8221;, as they call it). I was thinking
    I&#8217;d bash out a quick snarky post about the tyranny of the
    women&#8217;s mag and how they are warping the minds of young women etc
    etc.<\/p>\n
    <p>
      But as I turned the pages, I found myself snarkless. There were no
      relationship advice pieces, or sex tips. No weight loss articles, or sly
      &#8216;how many lovers is too many?&#8217; slut-shaming. No soul-searching
      cod psychology telling you to be yourself by following a set of detailed
      instructions.\u00a0Instead, there were an impressive\u00a0number of
      successful, independent, creative women featured, and none of them were
      asked if they have a boyfriend.<\/p>\n

          ageless women&#8217;s magazine staple, the horoscopes page. And there
          it was, tucked in at the back amongst the plastic surgery ads. However
          this is astrology with what I suspect
          <strong

                    These suggestions sit a bit oddly beside the commanding tone
                    of the usual astrological edicts to &#8220;be patient with
                    those around you&#8221; or &#8220;make sure you keep an open
                    diary&#8221; or &#8220;rain vengeance upon your enemies
                    until the fields run with blood&#8221; (I made one of those
                    up). The Fashion Forecast assumes a little of the same
                    mystical authority. When my boyfriend (a Virgo) is advised
                    to &#8220;don some trinket style jewellery&#8221; I hear an

                      You can probably sense that I&#8217;m not a true believer
                      in the influence of the stars on our daily lives. But I
                      think for the most part it does no harm. It gives people a
                      symbolic system which helps them make sense of the
                      baffling experience of being alive. I don&#8217;t believe
                      in fate, and there are plenty of people I&#8217;d like to
                      take more responsibility for their decisions and choices,
                      but I can also see that lots of people just aren&#8217;t
                      equipped to shoulder that burden. In short: life is hard,
                      any port in a storm.<\/p>\n

                      I can&#8217;t remember ever reading a fashion \/ beauty \/
                      shit psychology magazine aimed at women which didn&#8217;t
                      have horoscopes, and astrology is generally held to be a
                      feminine pursuit. A 2005\u00a0<a
                      href=\"http:\/\/www.gallup.com\/poll\/19558\/paranormal-beliefs-come-supernaturally-some.aspx\">Gallup
                      poll<\/a>\u00a0found that 30% of women in Britain claimed
                      to &#8216;believe in&#8217; astrology compared to 14% of
                      men. But then 13% of both men and women said they believed
                      in witches so the common argument that women are more
                      susceptible to believe in magic and the paranormal is
                      hardly watertight. Alarmingly 20% of men in the USA said
                      they believe in witches. Guys. C&#8217;mon.<\/p>\n

                      twitter who suggested that women&#8217;s interest in
                      astrology might be linked to a wider belief in fate or
                      destiny arising from social conditioning.<\/p>\n

                            There&#8217;s also something to be said for women

                            history of women&#8217;s mysticism or participation
                            in magical or occult societies, often bringing women
                            a freedom and license denied to them in traditional

                              burden\u201d which I find difficult to argue with.
                              And given that my starting point is that the
                              movement of the planets has no effect on our
                              behaviour or personality whatsoever (until they

                              course) perhaps astrology can offer an indirect
                              route to self knowledge or at least self
                              improvement. The language makes me feel a bit

                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Well, I don&#8217;t think astrology deserves to be
                              at the top of any feminist&#8217;s hit list, but
                              it&#8217;s not all fluff. Edut approvingly quotes
                              J.P. Morgan saying that \u201cmillionaires
                              don\u2019t use astrology; billionaires do\u201d, a
                              quote which I initially read as negative &#8211;
                              because they&#8217;re so utterly detached from
                              anything resembling a normal life they need to try
                              and establish some sort of meaning to their
                              existence no matter how absurd and
                              implausible?<\/p>\n
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              But Edut\u00a0adds \u201cHow\u2019s that for an
                              antidote to the seventy cents women earn to each
                              man\u2019s dollar?\u201d It&#8217;s a joke, but
                              that&#8217;s where I think the harm is. Self
                              knowledge and individual success is grand and
                              I&#8217;d say the identification of astrology with
                              the feminine isn&#8217;t any more damaging than
                              the other qualities, interests and traits that
                              stick to gender identities like old chewing gum.
                              But women&#8217;s magazines peddle spiritual power
                              alongside beauty and sexual power ,and none of
                              them are a substitute for equal pay; bodily
                              autonomy; freedom from violence; status, authority
                              and representation. Reading your fate in the stars
                              might be reassuring, but you might be missing a
                              chance to change the world.<\/p>\n
