            <p>
              The workshop was fascinating, absorbing, and not as gruesome as I
              had feared. Having been frozen and bashed about a bit, my subject
              (who I&#8217;ve since named Boudica) didn&#8217;t look anything
              like a live guinea pig when I met it, so its\u00a0<em
                >thingness<\/em>\u00a0made it surprisingly easy to cut
                into.<\/p>\n
                <p>
                  Although I&#8217;m a big fan of badly stuffed animals, from
                  the famous\u00a0<a

                  newfound respect for the taxidermist&#8217;s art. Taking the
                  skin off was reasonably straightforward, but my god it&#8217;s
                  difficult to get the creature into the right shape.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  But I was reasonably pleased with the result, and Boudica G.
                  Pig proudly adorns my mantelpiece. At some point I need to get
                  her a spear, helmet and tiny chariot but that&#8217;s a
                  project for another day.<\/p>\n

                    Interestingly, as well as the glamorous Amanda herself and
                    her assistant on the day I&#8217;d estimate that the
                    workshop participants were nearly all women. Taxidermy is
                    clearly kinda fashionable at the moment, and although I
                    can&#8217;t say it was at the top of my equality agenda
                    I&#8217;m pleased that women are getting stuck in.<\/p>\n

                    taxidermy, there are a surprising number of stuffed animals

                    Creepy cool<\/h3>\n
                    <p>
                      That said, no matter how cool it becomes I doubt taxidermy
                      will ever stop being creepy altogether. Firstly because it
                      makes you think of death. Stuffed animals act as a kind of
                      hipster memento mori. Secondly because part of
                      taxidermy&#8217;s appeal (particularly as part of an
                      artwork) is its uncanny effect, the ambiguity of animate
                      or inanimate, alive or dead.\u00a0And finally because
                      taxidermy is so firmly lodged in the symbolic language of
                      horror, where it also takes on a fascinating\u00a0gendered
                      aspect.<\/p>\n<div style=\"width: 310px\"

                                For Niesel, \u201ctaxidermy represents the most
                                literal expression of male violence, and reveals
                                both the violence and the ultimate instability
                                located at the core of a patriarchal system that
                                relies on validation from passive feminine
                                subjects.\u201d He views taxidermy

                                      to possess women while silencing their
                                      subjectivity, turning them into objects.
                                      As Niesel observes, \u201ca stuffed woman
                                      is the perfect woman because her male
                                      companion can make her say whatever he
                                      wants.\u201d<\/p>\n

                                                    passive than other
                                                    creatures, but his statement
                                                    resonates throughout the
                                                    film because it describes
                                                    the way women are treated.
                                                    Women are expected to be
                                                    stuffed birds, and there is
                                                    a constant tension involved
                                                    in trying to enforce their
                                                    &#8220;passivity.&#8221;
                                                    Women pose a threat in the
                                                    film because they might do
