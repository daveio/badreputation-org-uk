      >The Edinburgh Fringe has begun! I\u2019m not there yet \u2013 I\u2019ll
      get there next Saturday \u2013 but the Twitter updates from friends there
      are already making me jealous and nostalgic in almost equal measure. This
      year will be my fourth Fringe \u2013 so here\u2019s a beginner\u2019s
      guide from &#8211; if not an old hand &#8211; someone who&#8217;s been

        Welcome to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival! Wave goodbye to your money,
        sobriety and any semblance of a normal sleep pattern. Say hello to the
        weird, the wonderful, and hysterical, dry-heaving laughter of a kind
        that won&#8217;t quite translate to the outside world.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        Get ready to start spotting your idols just walking down the street, get
        ready to say \u2018no thanks\u2019 to flyers roughly every 30 seconds,
        and wind up taking them anyway because the person handing you them was
        funny\/charming\/in a funny costume\/worryingly eager. Primarily:
        prepared to be completely overwhelmed for choice.<\/p>\n<div

        The very first time I went to the Fringe, I just dipped in for a day
        when I happened to be in Scotland. My travelling companion and I almost
        had panic attacks when we started leafing through the Fringe Brochure
        (about 1\/3 the size of a Yellow Pages directory and stuffed full of
        tempting offers). In the end, we managed three shows in one day,
        literally ran from one venue to another to make it in time and managed a
        pretty full Fringe experience:
        <strong
          >Debbie Does Dallas: the Musical<\/strong>, the wonderful Aussie
          musical comedy guys <a
          href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=wSqFqhUzutgc
          http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=wSqFqhUzutg\">Tripod<\/a>, and a
          belly-flop of a gig when we paid \u00a310 to see Phill Jupitas Reads
          Dickens. It was literally just Phill Jupitas reading some of
          Dickens&#8217; lesser-known short stories and \u2013 on that day
          \u2013 he was in a foul mood. Also: the day cost us \u00a345 each in
          tickets alone. This was before I knew about the Free Fringe (more on
          that in a moment).<\/p>\n
          <p>
            The great thing about the last couple of years when I&#8217;ve been
            up with a show (mostly just doing the flyering for them) is that way
            you have a big group of mates up there, and you can learn from each
            other&#8217;s viewing mistakes and benefit from each other&#8217;s
            recommendations. There are more shows at Edinburgh than you&#8217;ll
            ever be able to get through, even if you&#8217;re there for the full
            three weeks with both a millionaire&#8217;s budget and a jetpack to
            get from venue to venue \u2013 so choosing how to spend your time is
            important.<\/p>\n

              This is where is all happens. The Royal Mile is a cobbled,
              pedestrianised stretch of road which \u2013 for the time of the
              Fringe \u2013 will become a gauntlet of street performers,
              impromptu performances, and a small forest\u2019s worth of flyers.
              Shows with cool costumes will be flyering in character,
              improvisers will be improvising, musicians will be singing, and
              three small Fringe stages will be showing 10-20 minute showcases
              from a wide variety of shows.<\/p>\n

                href=\"http:\/\/freefringe.org.uk\/\">PBH Free Fringe<\/a> is a
                wonderful institution. It\u2019s been running since 1996, put
                together by a guy called Peter Buckley Hill (known to many as
                PBH.) As the Fringe became more and more expensive, the
                financial risks increased for performers. While headline names
                from the telly have guaranteed audiences, the vast majority of
                performers will be lucky if they break even after a run. As the
                main groups of venues increased their prices over the years, the
                financial risks of taking a show up to the Fringe also
                increased. A debt of a few grand isn&#8217;t unheard of, and is
                easily enough to wipe out a small arts troupe. To counteract
                this, PBH set up the Free Fringe, where performers don\u2019t
                pay for the venues and audiences don\u2019t pay to enter.

                There\u2019s lots of bucket-shaking at the end, but you can see
                a show and
                <em
                  >then<\/em> decide what it\u2019s worth. A good guide: give as
                  many pounds as you would give it stars (out of five). If <a
                  href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/2011\/04\/21\/a-lower-low\/\">it
                  sucked<\/a> \u2013 you can just walk out. No obligation. No
                  misgynistic asshole will call. If it rocked your world, give
                  them a fiver (or more!) and buy a book or a CD from the
                  performers. It&#8217;s good manners to buy a drink at the
                  venues to make sure they stay with the Free Fringe next year,
                  and to make sure you have enough change at the end. (If
                  you&#8217;re broke, you can always just shake the
                  performer&#8217;s hand and say thank you.)<\/p>\n

                                  on late at night, but try to get enough sleep
                                  to stay sane, healthy, and up to the task. A
                                  couple of times in the past, I&#8217;d realise
                                  I was finding something intellectually funny
                                  but was just too shattered to fully appreciate
