  Perhaps one reason we now refer almost exclusively to \u2018actors\u2019 is
  that, for the longest time, the word \u2018actress\u2019 was synonymous with
  \u2018prostitute\u2019. Presumably this relates to the Immodesties they are
  obliged to suffer on stage; as
  <strong
    >Shakespeare in Love<\/strong> taught us all so well, pre-Restoration these
    were considered so severe that women were not allowed on stage at
    all.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_8837\" style=\"width: 310px\"

      This exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery looks at the moment
      immediately after Charles II reversed this rule, and it\u2019s a fun
      little look at some portraits, caricatures and paraphernalia of women who
      <em
        >were<\/em> allowed on stage, \u2018from Nell Gwyn to Sarah
        Siddons\u2019. It\u2019s focused on portraits, but there are some super
        little earthenware tiles with different actresses on them in Room 3.
        There\u2019s also a facsimile of the Yellow Pages-style brothel
        directory,
        <strong
          >Harris\u2019 List of Covent Garden Ladies; or, The Man of
          Pleasure\u2019s Kalendar<\/strong>, illustrating the fall from grace
          of the once \u2018Convent and Garden\u2019 of Westminster Abbey \u2013
          a bit too close to eighteenth-century Theatreland for PR-comfort.
          Since its <a
          href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/Harriss-Covent-Garden-Revealing-History\/dp\/0752435469\">reissue
          by the History Press<\/a> this book has now achieved some cult status
          \u2013 the guy next to me, looking at it, said to his companion,
          \u2018You know, Gladys: Harris\u2019 List \u2013 that\u2019s the one
          we\u2019ve got in the toilet\u2019.<\/p>\n
          <p>
            <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nell_Gwyn\">Nell<\/a>
            (c.1651-87) opens this exhibition \u2013 a talented comic actress,
            although she is popularly most recognised for inspiring Charles
            II\u2019s last words \u2018Let not poor Nelly starve\u2019 (she
            survived him by barely a year, fact fans). There are two portraits
            of her here, in both of which she\u2019s got her mammaries out. This
            exhibition would have these as evidence of her \u2018skillful
            manipulation\u2019 rather than \u2018brazen hussydom\u2019; the
            second portrait shows her <a
            href=\"http:\/\/i.thisislondon.co.uk\/i\/pix\/2011\/10\/18-nell-gwyn-415.jpg\">naked
            to the waist<\/a> and looking directly at the viewer with a gaze at
            once languid and challenging. You might be reminded of Manet\u2019s
            <a
            href=\"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/6\/6a\/Manet%2C_Edouard_-_Olympia%2C_1863.jpg\"><strong
              >Olympia<\/strong><\/a>, condemned as \u2018vulgar\u2019 and
              \u2018immoral\u2019 on its first exhibition at 1863, mainly
              because the nude is looking directly at the viewer rather than
              obligingly turning her head away for better ogling comfort. And
              indeed, such a tension between looking and being looked at
              probably underscored a lot of the moral uncertainty about the
              early actresses.<\/p>\n
              <p>
                Later on, we get <a
                href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sarah_Siddons\">Sarah
                Siddons<\/a> (1755-1831), powerful, tragic
                <em
                  >grande dame<\/em>. She appears in Room 3 painted by Thomas
                  Lawrence as public intellectual, tutor to the royal children
                  \u2013 and at a vantage point that forces us to look up at her
                  imperious face, rather than to avert our eyes from her naked
                  bosom. This is hung alongside a number of grandiose
                  actress-as-Muse paintings, large as their themes, and also
                  including Muses of Comedy and society amateurs like Georgiana,
                  Duchess of Devonshire.<\/p>\n
                  <p>
                    But even in the late eighteenth century \u2018actress\u2019
                    still wasn\u2019t a career you\u2019d want for your wife.
                    Thespiennes like <a
                    href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Elizabeth_Ann_Linley\">Elizabeth
                    Ann Sheridan<\/a> (1754-1792) and <a
                    href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Elizabeth_Farren\">Elizabeth
                    Farren<\/a> (1759-1829) \u2013 both exhibited here \u2013
                    gave up their acting careers, on request, upon marriage.
                    While the eighteenth-century gentleman was not renowned for
                    being into female careers in general, the issue here seems
                    to be more \u2018other men looking at your wife\u2019 than
                    anything else: after all, these men were \u2018forward
                    thinking\u2019 enough to marry an actress in the first
                    place. Perhaps they were nervous of the number of early
                    actresses, like Nell, who had affairs with kings and nobles.
                    If so, they had a good few hundred years of uncertainty
                    left: Edward VII was still pretty into actresses at the turn
                    of the twentieth century. \u2018I\u2019ve spent enough on
                    you to build a battleship\u2019 he complained to <a

                    (It may have been such impertinence that led to her

                    But, as this exhibition shows, one of the primary moral
                    gripes with these early actresses was actually about
                    something a bit unexpected: the <a
                    href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Travesti_(theatre)\"><em
                      >travesti<\/em><\/a> roles many of them built careers on.
                      There are some fascinating visual representations in this
                      exhibition of actresses \u2013 like Dorothy Jordan
                      (1761-1816), whose bosom apparently \u2018concealed
                      everything but its own charms\u2019 \u2013 in their famous
                      \u2018breech\u2019 roles, both Shakespearean (stalwarts
                      like

                          Thumb). It seems that, after decades of young boys
                          aping womanhood, the first actresses set themselves
                          the challenge of continuing the noble tradition: it
                          was conscious decision, rather than occasional
                          dramatic necessity, for many of them to adopt the
                          <em

                              The Immodesty here implied resulted in endless
                              caricatures, many of which are exhibited here. My
