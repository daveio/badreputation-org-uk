<p>
  Well, if you\u2019re
  <strong
    >Nancy Wake<\/strong> you cycle alone across 500km of enemy territory in
    order to find replacements. Who was Nancy Wake and what made her so
    astonishingly badass? Let\u2019s step back to the start of World War II to
    find out.<\/p>\n
    <p>
      A New Zealand-born nurse, Wake had travelled the world before settling in
      France in the 1930s. At the start of the war she was living with her new
      husband, industrialist Henri Fiocca, in the hills outside Marseille.
      Within months this would be occupied territory as Western Europe fell to
      the rapid advance of Nazi forces.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      With a continent falling to the horrors of war, and possessing sufficient
      money to live comfortably anywhere in the world, many of us might say
      \u201chmm, perhaps it\u2019s time to move to America.\u201d Many of us
      might choose to keep our heads down, live the life of a wealthy socialite
      \u2013 a relatively safe course of action even in wartime. But not Nancy
      Wake. She became involved in the Resistance, delivering supplies and
      acting as a courier, purchasing a vehicle to serve as an ambulance for the
      care of refugees. Wake became more deeply involved with the Resistance as
      the war continued, becoming a key figure in the escape lines that helped
      smuggle escapees, downed airmen and Dunkirk survivors over the Pyrenees
      and into Spain. (And here it should be noted that Wake was far from the
      only woman to go to extraordinary risks to save the lives of escapees. <a
      href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Andre_de_Jongh\">Andr\u00e9e de
      Jongh<\/a> of the Belgian Com\u00e8te Line and countless others performed
      acts of extraordinary heroism to do what they saw as a necessary
      task.)<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      At rough estimate, the work of Wake and the rest of her escape line
      organisation lead to as many as a thousand people being safely smuggled
      out of France between the start of the war and 1943. But she didn\u2019t
      stop there.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      You see, it turned out the Gestapo didn\u2019t approve of resistance
      movements or helping escaping prisoners. So strongly did they disapprove
      of such behaviour that by 1943 they had Wake (codenamed \u2018The White
      Mouse\u2019 for her ability to evade capture) listed at the top of their
      most wanted list, with a five million franc reward for her capture.
      There\u2019s a curious sort of honour in being recognised as the
      Gestapo\u2019s most wanted person, the scary sort of honour that would see
      most people go to ground and stop risking themselves. But not, as
      you\u2019ve probably guessed by now, Nancy Wake. It would take the
      betrayal of her cell, her near capture, and the insistence of her fellow
      resistance members to get her to finally escape over the Pyrenees and
      safely to England via Spain. Along the way she endured four days of
      interrogation at the hands of the Vichy French in Toulouse, and walked
      away from that as if it were hardly even worth noting.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      So, you\u2019ve spent the last several years of your life helping escaping
      prisoners. You\u2019ve narrowly avoided capture on more than one occasion,
      been arrested, interrogated, and hunted by the Gestapo. After a grueling
      journey you\u2019re finally safe in Britain. This is where you stop, say
      to yourself \u201cright, I achieved some amazing things, time to relax and
      let someone else finish things up,\u201d yes?<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      No, of course not. What you do now, assuming you\u2019re a solid brass
      badass like Nancy Wake, is join the Special Operations Executive. And
      then, after a scant few months of training you parachute back into
      Auvergne in central France and begin organising a guerilla warfare
      movement. After all, someone has to pave the way for the D-Day
      landings.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      On this second round in France, now under operating under the aegis of the
      SOE, Wake and other men and women of the SOE led a 7,000 strong group of
      <a
      href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Maquis_%28World_War_II%29\">\u2018Maquis\u2019<\/a>,
      or freedom fighters. It was during this time that Wake made her marathon
      bike ride to retrieve the radio codes. In between gruelling cross country
      bike rides and organising supply drops, she also found time to lead covert
      attacks on Gestapo headquarters at Montlucon, and to launch a strike on
      the SS 2nd Panzer Division which reportedly drew such ire that the
      division sent fully 15,000 troops after Wake and her Maquis. As with all
      the previous challenges, she wasn&#8217;t put off by a mere Panzer
      division coming after her.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        \u201c[Nancy Wake] is the most feminine woman I know, until the fighting
        starts. Then, she is like five men.&#8221;<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        &#8211; Henri Tardive, fellow Resistance member<\/p><\/blockquote>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        So, by the end of the war in Europe Wake had been responsible for the
        provision of aid to refugees, the saving of hundreds of escapees\u2019
        lives, and a series of daring acts of heroism that could keep war film
        writers in business for decades. All of this done in the face of
        countless risk, and why? Because it needed doing, and she was in a
        position to do it, so she was damn well going to. It took 59 years for
        her own government to recognise her service and appoint her a Companion
        of the Order of Australia in honour of her achievements.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          &#8220;I hate wars and violence, but if they come I don&#8217;t see
          why we women should just wave our men a proud goodbye and then knit
          them balaclavas.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&#8211;
          Nancy Wake<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">(As a
          final note, Wake is only one of many women whose valorous acts in
          World War II are worthy of note. The SOE had 39 women serving in
          France alone. <a
