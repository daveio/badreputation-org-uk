Heroes: Mae Jemison"},"content":{"rendered":"
<p>
  At some point in their childhood, most people want to be astronauts when they
  grow up. A member of an elite few, taking huge risks in the name of science
  and getting to see a view of the Earth no one else will. A lot of children
  probably also want to grow up to be doctors; intelligent, prestigious, and
  well paid.
  <strong
    >Mae Jemison<\/strong> wasn\u2019t content to just aspire to one or the
    other. Oh no. Mae Jemison grew up, as she was confident she would, to be a
    <em
      >doctor in space<\/em>. How much ass does that kick? All of it. <\/p>\n
      <p>
        Born in Alabama in 1956, Jemison\u2019s family moved to Chicago in 1959
        to take advantage of the better educational opportunities there. Jemison
        took to the sciences with ease, doing well enough in her studies that
        she was able to enrol at Stanford University aged just 16. <\/p>\n
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          In kindergarten, my teacher asked me what I wanted to be when I grew
          up, and I told her a scientist. She said, &#8216;Don&#8217;t you mean
          a nurse?&#8217; Now, there&#8217;s nothing wrong with being a nurse,
          but that&#8217;s not what I wanted to be. <\/p>\n
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
          Jemison faced barriers due to both racism and sexism at Stanford,
          particularly in the engineering department, a place that was (and
          unfortunately to some extent still is) the domain of well off white
          males. She describes, looking back, occasions where professors would
          ignore her input while congratulating her male classmates for the
          exact same comments, and credits her success in part to the youthful
          arrogance of a teen allowing her to push on through.<\/p>\n

          After getting her chemical engineering degree Jemison went on to study
          medicine at Cornell, graduating in 1981. She did extensive work abroad
          during her time there, ranging from Thailand to Kenya as a primary
          care provider, and eventually joining the <a
          href=\"http:\/\/www.peacecorps.gov\/\">Peace Corps<\/a> in 1983. With
          the Peace Corps she served in Sierra Leone, acting both as a medical
          doctor and a writer of guidelines, care manuals, and research
          proposals.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          So, we\u2019ve established she\u2019s pretty goddamn awesome as both a
          doctor and a scientist. But I promised you a doctor in space, and so
          far it\u2019s all been ground bound<sup

              Kennedy Space Centre while training for her launch, helping to
              send other shuttle flights up into orbit. Her own turn came in
              1992, when she became the first black woman to go into space,
              flying aboard the shuttle Endeavour with the six other astronauts

                    For the next 190 hours Jemison would orbit the Earth, one of

                      having spent the last eight days being awesome enough to

                        STS-47 was to be Jemison\u2019s only space mission, as
                        she retired from NASA shortly after her return. She
                        wanted to focus on social issues surrounding technology,
                        its impact in developing nations, and means of
                        mitigating future-shock. To this end she founded two
                        rather cool organisations. First up, doing applied
                        research, there\u2019s the

                          thermal energy generation for developing countries,
                          and satellite communications for facilitating health

                              people to think globally about how technology can
                              deal with problems. The group works to build
                              critical thinking skills and scientific literacy,
