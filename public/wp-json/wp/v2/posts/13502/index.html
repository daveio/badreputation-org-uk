              First of all, some housekeeping: er, it&#8217;s been a while since
              I last put out one of these, so sorry about that. My degree sort
              of ate me (final year), and it stands to swallow me whole again in
              a couple of weeks (FINAL YEEEAR), but I promise to get back to
              some kind of regular posting schedule in the summer.<\/p>\n

              Alright! Let&#8217;s talk about alpha males. Specifically,
              let&#8217;s talk about how spurious science has constructed a
              cultural narrative in which the expectation of alpha-dom has been
              projected onto men. Even
              <em
                >more<\/em> specifically, let&#8217;s talk about what that means
                in romance novels, because the Alpha Male (see also
                &#8220;alphahole&#8221; and &#8220;alphole&#8221;) of
                Romancelandia is a different specimen to the kind uplifted by,
                say, economy theorists. Or PUAs.<\/p>\n

                  This in itself is kind of interesting to me, to be honest,
                  because I encounter a lot of guys (and I&#8217;m sure
                  I&#8217;m not the only person to have experienced this) who
                  say that they feel they

                        At first glance, you&#8217;d see that pretty well backed
                        up by the sheer overwhelming presence of the alpha male
                        in romance novels. You don&#8217;t even have to delve
                        into a Mills and Boon backlist to see it; take

                          arrogant, and controlling, and he gets what he wants.
                          He&#8217;s tormented, angsty, abusive and stalkerish

                              A Mills and Boon backlist will show you a lot more
                              of the same, though. This brand of alpha male is
                              raw power in a designer suit; he mixes pure,
                              unbridled Man with all the trappings of high
                              civilisation, because his power is such that he
                              can dominate any world he wants to. Often
                              he&#8217;s risen up from humble beginnings or has
                              some kind of connection with a criminal
                              underworld, just so you know he&#8217;s a
                              badass.<\/p>\n

                              A different breed of alpha male emphasises the
                              badass aspect over the size of the wallet. One of
                              the most popular alpha males in recent releases is
                              Kane &#8220;Tack&#8221; Allen, hero of Kristen

                                  because her books &#8211; and their wild

                                  the romance-reading community, and I think

                                      from the sides that I knew, I just knew,
                                      came from laughing. A dark goatee around

                                          understanding, Ashley heroes tend to.
                                          I gave up highlighting all the
                                          stereotypical alpha behaviours he

                                          the book&#8217;s quite long, but I
                                          when I looked at all the ones

                                          grabbed hold of her and she told him
                                          to back off and he wouldn&#8217;t. And

                                                I could, because there are a lot

                                                in it. One last one, though,
                                                because it&#8217;s important. He
                                                manhandles her and tells her
                                                what to do and in the end she is
                                                happy with it because deep down,
                                                it&#8217;s what she wants. So
                                                far, so adherent to PUA theory.
