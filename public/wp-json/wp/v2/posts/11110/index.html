<p>
  As promised, I actually played games this month! I started off with
  <strong
    >Portal 2<\/strong>&#8216;s Perpetual Testing Initiative (which I mentioned
    <a
    href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/2012\/05\/09\/gamer-diary-what-ive-been-playing-april-2012\/\">last

    efforts that I might, maybe, possibly, probably, harbour a teeny love of
    Deadly Goo. \u00a0Having attempted to use

        >Portal 2<\/strong>, I can say that the new in-game Puzzle Maker is much
        simpler.<\/p>\n
        <p>
          Obviously the simplicity has benefits as well as negative points:
          it&#8217;s simpler to use, so therefore more of the community can try
          their hand at map-making for an extremely popular title. \u00a0This is
          demonstrated by the fact that since the Puzzle Maker has been
          available, the number of<strong>

                      The negatives, I feel, come with the restrictions you face
                      with what is available to you in the Puzzle Maker: e.g.
                      you can&#8217;t add extra doors for staged testing.
                      \u00a0Plus, try as I might to create things exactly as I
                      imagine them in my head, it never seems to be quite right
                      as not all the tools are available to you. \u00a0The
                      solution here would be to learn how to use Hammer
                      properly&#8230; but for a lot of fans that&#8217;s a bit
                      too confusing to contemplate.<\/p>\n

                    <p>
                      So, you may be wondering why my production of test chamber
                      blueprints stopped mind-May&#8230; the answer is
                      <strong
                        >Diablo 3<\/strong>. \u00a0This hit internationally on
                        May 15th and domestically (in the UK) May 18th.
                        \u00a0After some very irritating cock-ups from various
                        pre-order suppliers, I eventually got my hands on it for
                        the UK release date.<\/p>\n
                        <p>
                          I must say I&#8217;m sort of glad I didn&#8217;t get a
                          copy until May 18th as Blizzard had some serious
                          issues on the international release. Let me explore
                          these.

                              to me either. \u00a0Couple that with the fact that
                              their servers clearly weren&#8217;t ready &#8211;
                              nor capable &#8211; of handling the volume of
                              people trying to connect. \u00a0Again,

                                  Error 37 screengrabs were plastered all over
                                  the internet as eager fans were raging at
                                  Blizzard. \u00a0That&#8217;s not to say I
                                  didn&#8217;t escape: I&#8217;ve had three
                                  instances since I got the game where
                                  I&#8217;ve been unable to play because the
                                  damned servers were having a tea break (or
                                  eating themselves, I dunno) with Error 35
                                  taking out the game on May 20th for over 9
                                  hours and Error 37 rearing its ugly head again
                                  nearer the end of the month (<em

                                        actually do it or not only time will

                                          Enough of that. \u00a0The game itself
                                          is great fun with brilliantly detailed
                                          graphics and fun attacks for all
                                          classes. \u00a0This is the first RPG
                                          of this type (<a title=\"Wikipedia:

                                          &#8211; and am now going through it
                                          again to try and find better loot (so
                                          far unsuccessfully). \u00a0The fact
                                          that I haven&#8217;t got bored yet is
                                          praise in itself as I do have a

                                          every class and on every difficulty.
                                          \u00a0Again, time will tell if I do
                                          end up admitting defeat.<\/p>\n

                                          Blizz have done OK with the female
                                          characters; yes, they start off fairly
                                          under-dressed but so do the male
                                          counterparts. \u00a0My one criticism
                                          is the fem-Demon Hunter&#8217;s
                                          boots&#8230; why would you wear heels
