        <strong
          >Sucker Punch<\/strong><\/a> that I didn&#8217;t squee with joy over
          and clap my hands like a small child about. I was so excited. It was
          as if someone had written down a big list of &#8220;things Sarah
          likes&#8221; and then made a film of it. It even had reams of
          clockwork, zombie nazis mowed down by women with Really Big Guns. Get
          in.<\/p>\n
          <p>
            I bought a vast tub of popcorn and settled down gleefully to absorb
            the aural extravaganza of a super-cooltasm created

                  >Sucker Punch<\/strong> is like a blind date who is perfect on
                  paper but in the flesh there&#8217;s just no spark. Worse,
                  they are annoying, their opinions and anecdotes are unfunny,
                  meandering nonsense and they lied about how tall they were
                  (I&#8217;m 5&#8217;9&#8243;, this matters). You spend the
                  whole, pitiful date alternately bored and clockwatching or
                  actively fighting down the urge to laugh out loud in mild
                  hysterics at the awfulness of the situation.<\/p>\n

                        to be entertained. This was never going to be high art,
                        but it was beyond mindless. I&#8217;m summarising for
                        the sake of summarising because the plot is basically
                        irrelevant, consisting of pointless scenes in which the
                        unfortunate actors mug badly scripted dialogue whilst
                        sobbing through mascara until the next fight
                        happens.<\/p>\n

                          There&#8217;s this girl called Baby Doll (don&#8217;t

                          Relative Action (don&#8217;t ask). She uses her Sexy

                                  Like the crap date, the film reeked of
                                  desperately wanting to be clever, ironic, sexy
                                  and cool. It was none of those things. It
                                  wasn&#8217;t even a good, silly action film.
                                  And I
                                  <em
                                    >like<\/em> good, silly action films. The
                                    fight scenes were very fast and quite short
                                    so you didn&#8217;t get any sense of
                                    excitement or drama from the battles: they
                                    focused on the look of the costumes and
                                    scenery rather than the actual
                                    fighting.<\/p>\n
                                    <p>
                                      The whole thing was tedious in a
                                      watching-someone-else-play-a-computer-game
                                      way. You watched, but didn&#8217;t really
                                      engage. There was no tension of any sort,
                                      at any point. I had no feelings nor
                                      empathy for any of the supposed
                                      &#8220;characters&#8221;. Even in the
                                      brief moments when I was vaguely aware of
                                      what was going on, or why, I
                                      <em

                                        exception was one tiny scene between the
                                        Doctor\/Madam and the Pimp\/Asylum
                                        Owner. Needless to say, this minor
                                        moment only served to remind me of what
                                        I wanted the film to be like.<\/p>\n
                                        <p>
                                          I exited the cinema feeling horribly
                                          disappointed (to the point of anger),
                                          let down, and deeply confused. You
                                          see, not only did the film contain all
                                          of the things that I liked and

                                            half of the people I was with really
                                            enjoyed it. The other half, like me,
                                            hated it. There were arguments on
                                            the tube ride home. Maybe it&#8217;s

                                                  been somewhat cathartic and
                                                  therapeutic, so thank you for
                                                  being there for me during this
                                                  terrible moment in my life.
                                                  And for understanding.
                                                  It&#8217;s appreciated.
                                                  I&#8217;m actually starting to
                                                  feel a little better for
                                                  having relieved myself of this
                                                  weight and have begun, a
                                                  little, to think of the
                                                  positive sides. Like that I
                                                  don&#8217;t need to see it
                                                  again. And that really it was
                                                  just a big, long,
                                                  not-very-good trailer for the
                                                  computer game. Which I am
                                                  looking forward to. The acting
                                                  will probably be
