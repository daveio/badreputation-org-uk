              One thing to be aware of when watching any of Ken Russell\u2019s
              films is that you will spend at least three quarters of the
              running time saying to yourself, \u2018What THE HELL am I
              watching.\u2019<\/p>\n

                        a B&#038;B in Derbyshire. The B&#038;B is run by two

                        re-enacts the legendary tale of an ancestor of his, who
                        killed a giant worm (guess what colour it was.) that was
