  I went to a healthfood shop today and bought NATURE SNACKS. Now, I don&#8217;t
  normally go into healthfood shops because I can&#8217;t understand their
  pitch. What&#8217;s all this marketing to people&#8217;s paranoia and fears
  about their bodies? Why do I go in and get a copy of HEALTH magazine in my
  face, adorned with a willowy, glowing woman telling me to lose weight and eat
  seeds? What&#8217;s all that about? I think they market their wares wrong.
  Instead of telling us to EAT FRUIT OUT OF FEAR OF FATNESS OR SIN, they should
  be all, MOTHERFUCKING NATURE SNACKS!! LOOK, THEY&#8217;RE MADE OUT OF TREES
  AND SHIT!!! EAT THESE AND BECOME KING OF THE FUCKING ELVES!!!!<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  <strong
    >Troll Hunter<\/strong>, though, gets its pitch exactly right. &#8220;TROLL
    HUNTER!!!&#8221; shouts the poster, in yellow, with a gritty picture of Hans
    The Troll Hunter&#8217;s well-defended Land Rover driving towards the legs
    of a truly gigantic troll. That&#8217;s what we like to see. Gets straight
    to the point. This is a film about a man who hunts trolls, and the trolls
    aren&#8217;t fucking around. That&#8217;s what it is.<\/p>\n<div

      Now, I&#8217;d read a few
      <em
        >pr\u00e9cis<\/em> of
        <strong
          >Andr\u00e9 \u00d8vredal<\/strong>&#8216;s film before I went to see
          it, which is something I generally avoid doing because I like to go to
          a film all clean of bias, but it would have been hard to remove my
          firmly-lodged desire to see this film, because
          <em
            >fuck I love monsters<\/em>. All the opinions I&#8217;d read started
            with something like, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t expect this to be
            hand-held-camera
            <strong
              >Blair Witch<\/strong> mockumentary style!&#8221; so naturally, I
              expected that.<\/p>\n
              <p>
                However, given that information, I expected it to be a horror
                film about some kids who make a film about trolls.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>It&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s a film about trolls.<\/p>\n</p>
              <p>
                It is literally a film all about trolls. It&#8217;s not even a
                horror film about trolls. It&#8217;s just about trolls. You get
                to know about all the different sorts of troll, how long they
                live, what they eat, how long their gestation period is, and
                what they like to do with car tyres. It&#8217;s also a sensitive
                portrait of the hunter, Hans (<strong
                  >Otto Jespersen<\/strong>), and his lifelong symbiotic
                  relationship with them and their territorial warfare.
                  He&#8217;s sort of like the stoic, outdoorsy, very smelly
                  grandpa you always wanted. He&#8217;s not your typical big,
                  ripply, macho action hero. He&#8217;s like a grumpy,
                  landmine-collecting Sir David Attenborough. With a beard.
                  <em
                    >And landmines.<\/em> I found myself, as the credits rolled
                    to
                    <strong
                      >In The Hall Of The Mountain King<\/strong>, wanting to go

                        trolls with him.<\/p>\n
                        <p>
                          The whole film runs, as you can imagine from something
                          that&#8217;s shot on a hand-held camera ostensibly by
                          film students, completely devoid of soundtrack, but
                          that somehow makes it more immediate, more intimate:
                          it&#8217;s peppered with little details that make it
                          feel very
                          <em
                            >real<\/em>, and all the people in it less like
                            characters that have been written and cast, but more
                            like ordinary people, with their own failings and
                            idiosyncrasies.\u00a0 To illustrate this I need to
                            give a mild spoiler away, so

                                      another thing I wasn&#8217;t expecting. I
                                      laughed like an audience-disturbing drain
                                      at some points (seriously,

                                        delighted child at others (see? awful).
                                        The humour and humanity help it feel
                                        true, which in turn makes the danger
                                        feel really dangerous and the tension
                                        feel really tense. It&#8217;s deeply
                                        engrossing for it.<\/p>\n

                                          currently on offer &#8211; and indeed
                                          different from similar shaky-cam

                                              while to get into. You have to
                                              adapt. You don&#8217;t really

                                              usually watch films. It helps by

                                              being a collection of recordings
                                              anonymously dropped off at a
                                              studio, which certainly got me
                                              into the right mindset, but your
                                              mileage may vary.<\/p>\n
