  <strong
    >Doctor Who <\/strong> returns this Saturday for the second part of the
    sixth series it has enjoyed since re-launching in 2005. It&#8217;s a
    television programme that has inspired many &#8211; kids and adults alike
    &#8211; to a great deal of hoping, dreaming and far far greater fandom than
    they ever thought possible. It&#8217;s a show that escapes reality yet deals
    with the fantastic in a way that we can all relate to. And, yes, we&#8217;ve
    always liked it because of the crappy monsters and special effects. Whether
    or not you are a fan of the Doctor, you may now be wondering why he deserves
    a mention here. Well, let me tell you this&#8230;. I think that
    <strong
      >Doctor Who <\/strong>is very much a feminist show.<\/p>\n

        \/><\/a>Although the Doctor has, so far, always been male and his
        companions are most often female, the gender of these characters are
        somewhat irrelevant when it comes to Getting Things Done. The Doctor is
        no James Bond or Indiana Jones. He uses intellect, banter and good
        old-fashioned running away rather than weapons, strength or bravado. In
        addition, there is nothing to say that regeneration could not leave our
        Time Lord resembling a human female in the future. This did happen when
        Joanna Lumley <a

        href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Doctor_Who_and_the_Curse_of_Fatal_Death\">Comic
        Relief spoof<\/a> in 1999, and there is often speculation about which
        female actor would be best to play the part.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        Having relatively little knowledge of the many original series of
        <strong
          >Doctor Who<\/strong>, due to my poor memory and loss of interest
          around the Colin Baker era, I thought I&#8217;d ask a dedicated fan
          for a second opinion on this theory. Nick from book blog <a
          href=\"http:\/\/leaf-pile.blogspot.com\/\">A Pile of Leaves<\/a>
          agreed that I was right about the irrelevant gender of the characters.
          &#8220;Often the Doctor is a paternal or pedagogic figure, but
          he\u2019s also depicted as fallible, flaky, eccentric, irascible. The
          first Doctor was told off quite a bit by his stern schoolteacher
          companion Barbara, the second Doctor was never as clever as
          astrophysicist Zoe, and the Fourth went around with a Time Lady for a
          while who was constantly correcting him.&#8221;<\/p>\n
          <p>
            The Doctor is simply a person, albeit an alien one, and so many of
            the usual tropes just won&#8217;t work here. He&#8217;s not
            &#8216;all knowing&#8217;, although he does a very good impression
            of that most of the time, and quite frequently he doesn&#8217;t have
            a plan. Most adventure stories have a hero who will always stay and
            fight, but the Doctor knows all too well when it&#8217;s time to
            simply give up and run away. Unlike most shows with a male and a
            female lead, none of the Doctors and companions have really had a
            romantic relationship until <a
            href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rose_Tyler\">Rose
            Tyler<\/a>, somewhat controversially, declared her love for David
            Tennant&#8217;s Doctor. The companions are usually just someone to
            hang around with, adding an extra layer of excitement and preventing
            the boredom of travelling alone. Occasionally they know a fair bit
            more than he does too.<\/p>\n

                writers to get the hang of exactly how best to do this. With the

                Sladen<\/a>, in Tom Baker&#8217;s second series as the Doctor
                Sarah-Jane became a strong, independent character who often
                worked things out for herself. The writers started to give her
                some of the lines that had been written for the Doctor and she
                became more of an equal partner to him, staying on the show for
                longer than most companions and also returning in 2006 for
                another adventure. Only the best companions get their own <a

                        have one of those too. Of course, with this being Who,
                        the character is no Jason Bourne. She was introduced in
                        2008 as a fearless professor and, due to also being a

                            chock full of cliches and stereotypes in places, but
                            this is a story where the parts could theoretically
                            be played by anyone. River Song could be Nathan
                            Fillion and the Doctor could be Helena Bonham
                            Carter. How great would that be? In a Saturday night

                            that singing well and looking pretty can make you a
                            star, isn&#8217;t it nice that they also have a show
                            to watch where a gang of intergalactic misfits can
                            win via the strategic application of a bit of
