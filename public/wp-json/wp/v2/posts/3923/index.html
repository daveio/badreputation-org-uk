  Before launching into this I want to preface what I say with this: Public
  health is a complex issue; there is a finite amount of money to be allocated
  and the long term cost\/benefit analyses are by no means straightforward.
  Organisations like <a title=\"National Institute for Health and Clinical
  Excellence\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nice.org.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\">NICE<\/a>
  have to make some occasionally very tough decisions, and sometimes good
  treatments have to be left out of guidelines because they would deprive other
  areas of resources judged to have a greater beneficial impact. With that said,
  on to an issue of current importance, in which NHS guidelines may well be
  letting a lot of people down.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_4143\" style=\"width:

</p>
<p>
  Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is one of the most common sexually transmitted
  infections. HPV symptoms include outbreaks of genital warts, and several of
  the strains (primarily types 16 and 18, which account for roughly 1 in 20
  infections according to CDC statistic) are responsible for the majority of
  cervical cancer cases. Cervical cancer is the second leading cause of cancer
  deaths amongst women worldwide, particularly in developing nations.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  So when vaccines that protect against the high-risk strains of HPV became
  available in 2008 it was a good thing, yes? A concerted vaccination program
  would reduce new infections, see a decrease in cervical cancer diagnoses over
  the next 15-20 years, and save millions of pounds in public health spending on
  pap smears, right? Well, sort of. The issue here is that there are two
  vaccines available, <a title=\"Wikipedia - Gardasil\"
  href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gardasil\"
  target=\"_blank\">Gardasil<\/a> from Merck and <a title=\"Wikipedia -
  Cervarix\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cervarix\"
  target=\"_blank\">Cervarix <\/a>from GlaxoSmithKline. Whilst both protect
  against strains 16 and 18, Cervarix does not provide any protection against
  the non-cancerous strains responsible for genital warts. Gardasil, by
  contrast, also protects against strains 6 and 11, which cause 90% of genital
  wart cases. Gardasil also has a rather high list price of \u00a3240 per
  person, whereas the makers of Cervarix have significantly undercut their list
  price in an unreleased contract with the NHS.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  In countries such as Australia, that have taken up Gardasil, there has been a
  75% decrease in new cases of genital warts over the last three years; the UK,
  over the same period, has seen no difference in the number of new cases.
  Whilst women aged 16-19 are the group most affected by this, the issue is one
  that matters to everybody: greater uptake of the vaccine increases herd
  immunity, protecting those who haven\u2019t been vaccinated as well (for the
  same time period cases in unvaccinated heterosexual males fell by one third in
  countries using Gardasil).<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  So, and this is the problem, we\u2019re now offered a vaccine that provides no
  protection against genital warts, and almost no information about the
  alternative (I could find just one mention of Gardasil on the NHS\u2019s HPV
  vaccination page <a title=\"NHS Vaccination Information\"
  href=\"http:\/\/www.nhs.uk\/Conditions\/HPV-vaccination\/Pages\/Introduction.aspx\"
  target=\"_blank\">here<\/a> ). Those in the know are seeking out Gardasil
  through private clinics, whilst the majority, arguably including those most at
  risk of infection, are left in the dark.<\/p>\n
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    \u201cWe, as consultants in sexual health, have been told to say nothing
    publicly that would damage the current vaccine programme, as the Cervarix
    vaccine has already been purchased. We have had to be circumspect in public
    but in private we have all purchased Gardasil for our own children and
    advised colleagues to do the same.\u201d \u2013 <a title=\"BBC Health\"
    href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/health-12417990\">Dr. Colm
    O\u2019Mahony and Dr. Steve Taylor<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n
  </p>
  <p>
    This is leading us into a split system whereby those who can are taking the
    greater protection of Gardasil, and everyone else is getting Cervarix. This
    is, I think, neither a reasonable nor efficient use of NHS funding, and
    somewhat gives the lie to health secretary Andrew Lansley\u2019s promise of
    \u201c<a title=\"NHS Local Commentary\"
    href=\"http:\/\/nhslocal.nhs.uk\/blogs\/nhs-local\/2010\/07\/no-decision-about-me-without-me\"
    target=\"_blank\">no decision about you without you<\/a>.\u201d<\/p>\n
  </p>
  <p>
    Treatment of genital warts costs the NHS \u00a331 million annually and takes
    trained staff away from time that could be spent on other serious
    conditions. It is difficult to gauge how this balances against the savings
    from sticking with the cheaper Cervarix, because the NHS will not release
    the details of their contract with GSK. With the contract coming up for
    renewal now is the time when Lansley needs to reveal the details of the
    contract, involve the public in the decision, and provide more accessible
    information regarding Gardasil.<\/p>\n
  </p>
  <p>
    Why is this relevant on a feminist blog? Fair access to this information
    (and related sexual health matters) is vitally important to women (and
    indeed to men). We all need to be equipped to not only make the best
    decisions for our own sexual health but also to campaign for those in the
    most at risk groups \u2014 who are currently being let down by the lack of
    information provided by the NHS. The choice of vaccine is an important issue
    that will effect tens of thousands of lives every year, and it is one the
    public needs to be involved in.<\/p>\n
