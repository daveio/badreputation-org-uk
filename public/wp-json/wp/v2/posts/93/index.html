    I went into this film grumbling slightly and kicking my heels. &#8220;Man
    fights exes in order to win girl, oh fucking great,&#8221; I said. The
    trailer hadn&#8217;t done anything to dissuade my grumblitude, and I&#8217;d
    spent the past few days staring angrily at <a
    href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Roman_de_la_Rose\">Le Roman De La
    Rose <\/a>and going, &#8220;HAVE OUR IDEAS OF HOW MEN AND WOMEN INTERACT IN

        So in I went, determinedly wiping my mind clean and free of any
        prejudice, and settled my fine arse down in one of the seats and glared
        at the cinema screen, daring it to prove me wrong.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>It literally did, as well.<\/p>\n</p>
      <p>
        I was comprehensively proved wrong about
        <strong
          >Scott Pilgrim<\/strong> by Scott Pilgrim, and I&#8217;m actually
          really glad of it, because I had a great time. Allow me to inform your
          mind-hole about how I was proved wrong and where.<\/p>\n
          <p>
            Well, firstly, there&#8217;s the whole evil-ex-fighting thing.
            &#8220;GRUMBLE,&#8221; said I. &#8220;FIGHTING FOR A WOMAN,&#8221;
            said I. It is, in fact, none of these things. I felt a bit stupid.
            Perhaps I should have read the graphic novels first? But then,
            I&#8217;m a firm believer in the idea of things being able to stand
            alone as works of art despite being based on a previous work, and I
            think this film does. So I sat there, stewing in my own
            uneducatedness, occasionally hissing &#8220;Hah! Reading the source
            material is FOR THE WEAK!&#8221; and actually loving it.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            But see, he&#8217;s not fighting for Ramona (The Girl, played by
            Mary Elizabeth Winstead) at all &#8211; he&#8217;s fighting for
            himself. Each ex is more daunting and jealousy-triggering than the
            next, and he&#8217;s fighting what we all fight when we get together
            with someone new &#8211; the Ghost Of Partners Past. Not the literal
            partners, but our ideas of them, and how much better they are than
            us.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            &#8230;I know it can&#8217;t just be me, okay, I just saw a film
            that said it wasn&#8217;t just me. Shut up.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            Secondly, I was all, &#8220;Ugh, this is going to be
            heteronormativity central&#8221;. It wasn&#8217;t. There
            wasn&#8217;t just gay visibility (with Kieran Culkin as
            Scott&#8217;s MIND-MELTINGLY ATTRACTIVE housemate Wallace OH GOD)
            but also a bit of bi visibility, with Ramona&#8217;s exes being
            adamantly
            <em
              >exes<\/em> and not
              <em
                >ex-boyfriends<\/em>. I mean, it&#8217;s spoiled a bit when
                Ramona confronts Roxy (Mae Whitman) with &#8220;It was just a
                phase, I was a little bi-curious&#8221; rather than it just
                being accepted unapologetically as, &#8220;Yep, I&#8217;m
                bisexual,&#8221; but in an age where bisexuality is still
                thought not to exist (!!) it&#8217;s something.\u00a0 Excuse me
                for triumphantly dancing around the only scrap of water in this
                desert.<\/p>\n<div style=\"width: 334px\" class=\"wp-caption

                  Thirdly, th-the female characters don&#8217;t suck! I thought
                  they were going to be crap, and they weren&#8217;t. Knives
                  (Ellen Wong) was fantastic. Ramona was stalwart and human. The
                  stand-out moment for me, however, was when Scott (Michael
                  Cera) and Ramona are in bed, and she says, &#8220;I&#8217;ve
                  changed my mind; I don&#8217;t want to have sex with you, and
                  I reserve the right to change my mind again about that
                  later&#8221; and that&#8217;s that. It passes with no
                  awkwardness, no negative comment and no pressure whatsoever.
                  It&#8217;s brilliant.\u00a0 Can we please have more positive
                  portrayal of women choosing
                  <em
                    >not<\/em> to shag guys in films, please? That&#8217;d be
                    great. Because too often, she&#8217;d be demonised for that
                    &#8211; words such as &#8220;fickle&#8221; and
                    &#8220;cock-tease&#8221; would be flung about like undesired
                    cornflakes placed before a two-year-old &#8211; but
                    she&#8217;s not, here.\u00a0 Hooray!<\/p>\n
                    <p>
                      Similarly, there&#8217;s no gay panic. You know<a
                      href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Homosexual_panic\">
                      gay panic<\/a>? Yeah, that. Well, it doesn&#8217;t exist
                      in le Universe d&#8217;Scott Pilgrim. Scott shares a bed
                      with his gay housemate (and his housemate&#8217;s
                      increasing library of lovers) with no comment or
                      problem.\u00a0\u00a0 It&#8217;s an idealised world where
                      the oft-played-on awkwardness of &#8220;straight
                      masculinity vs. gay masculinity&#8221; simply
                      doesn&#8217;t
                      <em
                        >exist<\/em>, and it&#8217;s really refreshing.<\/p>\n
                        <p>
                          Also, I was totally won over by the soundtrack and
                          visuals.\u00a0 Then again, I am a simple
                          creature.\u00a0 Glitter and 16-bit everywhere!\u00a0
                          It&#8217;s like an illegal rave in Marioland.\u00a0
                          I&#8217;m almost disappointed that I loved it. I
                          wanted a really good trumpeting rant, and I&#8217;ve
                          been denied that. Damn you,<strong>
