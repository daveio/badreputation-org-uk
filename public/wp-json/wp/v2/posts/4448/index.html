      Much has been said about his words, but a lot of the online discussion
      focuses on &#8220;I now think he&#8217;s a douche&#8221; and not on why
      the post should be regarded as offensive. Well, I&#8217;m pretty clear on
      why I find it offensive.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      In my posts for BadRep I have often expressed the sentiment that <A
      href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/2010\/12\/16\/big-dog\/\" \/>men
      have unique problems in society<\/a>, and that those problems are just as
      invisible as some feminist issues. I believe it&#8217;s true. I&#8217;ve
      also recently written a post which stated my feelings on the constant cry
      of &#8220;<A
      href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/2011\/03\/24\/but-what-about-teh-menz\/\"
      \/>but what about the men?<\/a>&#8221; in response to feminist discussion.
      Short answer: if you look at the world and don&#8217;t see massive gender
      inequality harming women a lot more than men, and don&#8217;t think that
      reducing the gap (and aiming to eliminate these issues for everyone) would
      be a good thing, then I don&#8217;t want to know you.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Scott Adams didn&#8217;t say that feminism was no longer needed, or that
      men have bigger problems than women. His post can be summed up in two
      parts:<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &#8220;Now I would like to speak directly to my male readers who feel
        unjustly treated by the widespread suppression of men\u2019s
        rights:<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>Get over it, you bunch of pussies.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n</p>
      <p>
        Why would he say that &#8211; because he sees women&#8217;s rights as
        far more under attack? Er&#8230; no. He has this advice instead:<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          &#8220;The reality is that women are treated differently by society
          for exactly the same reason that children and the mentally handicapped
          are treated differently. It\u2019s just easier this way for everyone.
          You don\u2019t argue with a four-year old about why he shouldn\u2019t
          eat candy for dinner. You don\u2019t punch a mentally handicapped guy
          even if he punches you first. And you don\u2019t argue when a women
          tells you she\u2019s only making 80 cents to your dollar. It\u2019s
          the path of least resistance. You save your energy for more important
          battles.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          Scott states that he&#8217;s
          <em
            >not<\/em> comparing &#8216;women&#8217; directly to &#8216;people
            with disabilities&#8217; or children, but does advise his (male)
            audience to treat them all the same way &#8211; to take into account
            the &#8220;emotional realities of other people&#8221;.<\/p>\n
            <p>
              And this is where most online discussion is only just starting to
              get it. It doesn&#8217;t MATTER if he&#8217;s right, or if
              he&#8217;s a realist. Either way this is shitty, inhumane
              advice.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              It puts the reader in the group taking action, and puts women (and
              other humans with inconvenient &#8217;emotional realities&#8217;)
              in a group marked &#8220;Other&#8221;. And as we all know,
              that&#8217;s classic 101 to dehumanising your target and making it
              easier to see them as objects who don&#8217;t need to be
              considered. It&#8217;s also bollocks. He&#8217;s giving
              instructions for how to manipulate others for your own success,
              without looking at any possibility of finding any common ground,
              sharing boundaries, or viewing them as real people who could be
              talked to. They&#8217;re just there to be made to go away with the
              least stress to him. Adams is dismissing the idea that his current
              views could be
              <em
                >wrong<\/em> and that he might learn something from women,
                because dialogue is not an option. He&#8217;d rather choose the
                path of least resistance. That&#8217;s a pretty closed mind
                right there.<\/p>\n
                <p>
                  It&#8217;s not easier for &#8220;everyone&#8221;, Scott. Just
                  you. <\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  It&#8217;s not easier for women, for example. Also: women,
                  children and &#8220;the mentally handicapped&#8221;(!) are
                  together a
                  <em
                    >majority<\/em>, which makes you sitting inside your
                    privileged minority and dismissing them like this all the
                    more craptastic. The majority of the human race are more
                    emotional than you, Scott, and as you&#8217;ve just
                    demonstrated probably have more empathy too.<\/p>\n
                    <p>Towards the end of the post he says:<\/p>\n</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p>
                        &#8220;Fairness is an illusion. It\u2019s unobtainable
                        in the real world.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        For someone who has spent decades writing about the
                        inhumanity of big business, that&#8217;s a surprising
                        quote. And my inner Hopeless Idealist rejects it
                        totally. Yes, men face different inequalities: in the
                        divorce courts, in countries with a military draft, in
                        society&#8217;s ancient ideas of what
                        &#8216;masculine&#8217; behaviour is. But even if I felt
                        that these somehow matched the towering mountain of
                        (frequently lethal) inequality facing women (which I
                        don&#8217;t by several miles), I would never give up on
                        seeking fairness. It&#8217;s an instinctive, empathic,
                        humane response which shows that you&#8217;re a decent
                        human being.<\/p>\n
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        So yeah, I now think Scott Adams is a douche as well.
                        Several additional words spring to mind (the lovely <a
                        href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/about\/\">Miranda<\/a>
                        put in a vote for &#8220;ableist asshat&#8221; at this
                        juncture). If you want to read his justifications (that
                        he often takes the point of view on his blog which is
                        most difficult to defend, that his readers know he often
                        doesn&#8217;t even believe the argument he&#8217;s
                        making, that we&#8217;re all devoid of &#8220;reading
                        comprehension&#8221;) then you can wander over to where
                        he&#8217;s currently <A
                        href=\"http:\/\/www.feministe.us\/blog\/archives\/2011\/03\/24\/scott-adams-to-mens-rights-activists-dont-bother-arguing-with-women-theyre-like-children\">trolling
                        the comment thread at Feministe.<\/a> Yes, seriously. At
                        no time does he back down from the opinion he stated, or
                        acknowledge how the act of grouping 51% of the planet
                        and more into an &#8216;overly emotional&#8217; box to
                        be safely ignored for his own mental peace of mind is in
                        any way douche-worthy.<\/p>\n

                      <p>
                        We are better than his exclusionary, patronising
                        bullshit, people. There&#8217;s an alternative where we
                        keep talking, and learning, and looking for ways to make
                        a society we can be proud of. Together. Because women
                        are human beings, and the fact that this still needs
                        saying means that <a

                        alternative is a land run by people as ignorant,

                                              party. On the 7th of March,
                                              Dilbert creator Scott Adams wrote
                                              a post on his blog. He then
                                              deleted it later. Here&#8217;s
