STARE OF AWESOME, 1943<\/p><\/div>\n
<p>
  Flying is for many people an utterly terrifying prospect. The loss of control,
  the unshakable awareness of all that distance between you and the ground, the
  realisation that you\u2019re strapped into a thin metal tube hurtling along at
  hundreds of miles an hour, and the knowledge that if something does go wrong
  you almost certainly won\u2019t walk away from it. It\u2019s no wonder a lot
  of people have a fear of flying.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  Jacqueline Cochran, on the other hand, quite distinctly did not have any fears
  when it came to taking to the air. Even today, a full thirty years after her
  death, she still holds more aviation records and firsts than any other pilot,
  ever.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  Born some time in the early 20th century (the details of her birth are
  somewhat unclear &#8211; she was raised by a foster family and didn\u2019t
  know her own date of birth), Cochran lived at a time when aviation was vastly
  more dangerous than it is now. Radios? Safety precautions? Reliable
  engineering? Stuff and nonsense. Those were just the far-flung dreams of
  futurists. To illustrate the perils of early aviation, consider the first US
  Air Mail service, which during the first couple of years of operation, saw the
  death of fully half its 40 pilots.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  Combine the expense and danger of flying with growing up in poverty and having
  minimal education, and it seems Jackie Cochran had little or no chance of ever
  taking to the air. This, however, is failing to account for her quite
  remarkable levels of determination, and refusal to take any nonsense from
  anyone. In one interview she recounts an experience working in a textile mill,
  aged perhaps 10 or 11.<\/p>\n

<blockquote>
  <p>
    I didn\u2019t see him coming, but a foreman was suddenly over me and
    pinching me in a way that no little girl should ever be pinched. My reaction
    was immediate and not surprising. My fist flew up and I hit him squarely on
    the nose. Hard. He jumped back and then rushed away, shocked. He never
    touched me again.<\/p>\n

    out of her plane at the 1938 Bendix Air Race<\/p><\/div>\n
  </p>
  <p>
    Cochran applied this same attitude to her flying lessons. Having been told
    that learning to fly would take two to three months, she accepted a wager
    from her future husband, Floyd Odlum, that she couldn\u2019t complete it in
    just six weeks. Three weeks later she finished flight school and got her
    wings. Within months she was entering some of the world\u2019s most
    prestigious air races.<\/p>\n
  </p>
  <p>
    A decade later she took this same determination into the US military. Having
    previously worked with the British Air Transport Auxiliary and been the
    first woman to fly a bomber across the Atlantic, Cochran proceeded to gather
    evidence to back her claim that female pilots were more than capable of
    filling all the domestic flight roles left empty during the war. With her
    experience training women to fly for the ATA, and drive to see them made a
    part of the Army Air Corps, Cochran eventually oversaw the creation of the
    Women Airforce Service Pilots, a group of just over a thousand pilots who
    collectively would cover 60,000,000 miles in every kind of military
    aircraft.<\/p>\n
  </p>
  <p>
    Following the war, Cochran upgraded to piloting jet engined aircraft and set
    one of her many records, becoming the first woman to break the sound
    barrier. Flying a modified Canadian jet up to over 45,000 feet, she made a
    dive towards the ground, not quite managing to break the barrier on her
    first attempt. When asked when she\u2019d like to make a second attempt,
    Cochran reportedly responded \u201cLet\u2019s go right now!\u201d The second
    attempt did the trick, a sonic boom echoing over the landscape as Cochran
    accelerated her jet towards the ground and passed Mach 1. Consider for a
    moment just how nerve-wracking an experience it has to be, accelerating a
    thin metal tube towards the ground from 45,000 feet, trying to get up faster
    than almost anyone had ever gone. Then consider just how badass you have to
    be to do that twice in one day, because the first time just wasn\u2019t
    quite fast enough.<\/p>\n
  </p>
  <p>
    What other records and achievements did Cochran manage? Alongside a list of
    speed and altitude records long enough to keep us here for several days, she
    was also the first pilot to ever make a \u2018blind\u2019 landing using only
    instruments, and the first pilot to fly above 20,000 feet with an oxygen
    mask. She was the first woman to enter the prestigious Bendix
    Trans-continental Air Race, and the first to win it, along with many other
    famously difficult air races throughout her career. Perhaps her most
    especially daring records were set during her flights of the F-104
    Starfighter, in which she set no less than three speed records in the space
    of a month.<\/p>\n
  </p>
  <p>
    The F-104 was a staggeringly dangerous craft to fly. In the first 18 months
    of its use the German Air Force had 85 fatal incidents involving them,
    earning it the nickname \u2018The Widowmaker\u2019. When a plane is killing
    off pilots at a rate of almost two a week you have to be exceptionally brave
    to climb into the cockpit even once, and exceedingly skillful to survive the
    experience often enough to set a handful of world records. Jackie Cochran
    was both.<\/p>\n
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to her contributions to aviation Cochran maintained a successful
    cosmetics business (indeed, it was to promote her \u2018Wings\u2019 line of
    cosmetics that she initially learned to fly). Following the war she poured a
    lot of her time and money into charitable causes, particularly those
    providing education and opportunity for those coming from impoverished
    backgrounds. Whilst she never gained the fame or attention of

      Earhart<\/a> <\/strong>(whose organisation of female pilots, The
      Ninety-Nines, Cochran presided over between 1941 and 1943), Cochran left a
      legacy as a successful businesswoman and one of the most daring and
      important pilots to have lived.<\/p>\n

                                          Flying is for many people an utterly
                                          terrifying prospect. Jacqueline
                                          Cochran, on the other hand, quite
                                          distinctly did not have any fears when
                                          it came to taking to the air. Even
                                          today, a full thirty years after her
                                          death, she still holds more aviation
                                          records and firsts than any other
                                          pilot, ever.<\/p>\n<div
