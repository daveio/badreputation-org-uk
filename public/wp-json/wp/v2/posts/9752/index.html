<p>
  I have decided to ape some of the monthly features of gaming print mags and
  introduce a \u201cWhat I\u2019ve been playing\u2026\u201d summary post.\u00a0
  Sometimes I can play very few games and other times I can get through quite a
  bit; more to the point, there&#8217;s always something to say but often it
  might not be strictly in the feminist vein, or there might not be
  <em
    >enough<\/em> to develop into a full article.\u00a0 So this post will be a
    bit of a test run \u2013 I know we\u2019re in February now but I\u2019m
    looking back at the completed month of Jan here \u2013 let\u2019s see how we
    go, shall we?<\/p>\n

          href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Arkham_City\"
          target=\"_blank\">Arkham City<\/a><\/strong> (as you can read in my <a

          Bat and his Bitches\"

          article<\/a>), but there were still some good things to say as
          well.\u00a0 The styling and the graphics were great (as they were in

            ><a title=\"Wikipedia - Arkham Asylum\"
            href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Batman:_Arkham_Asylum\"
            target=\"_blank\">Asylum<\/a><\/strong>), and I enjoyed the noir
            feel that they went for, although it didn\u2019t feel as gritty as
            the first game. \u00a0I suspect that may be because once you\u2019ve
            seen something for the first time it loses its special
            impact.<\/p>\n

                  <strong
                    >Asylum<\/strong> without the storyline longevity to really
                    back it up.\u00a0 There&#8217;re a lot of side quests and
                    other bits to do and investigate, so the game has expanded
                    in width as opposed to length.\u00a0 Personally, I tend to
                    let the side quests fall by the wayside as I power through
                    the story.\u00a0 It was a fairly competent and engaging(ish)
                    story until the ending (I won\u2019t spoiler but it sucked)
                    despite the near \u2018<em
                      >deus ex machina<\/em>\u2019 way in which they ended the
                      stories of four key characters.<\/p>\n
                      <p>
                        Playing as Catwoman was novel to begin with, but in the
                        end wasn\u2019t a big enough plus as one might have
                        hoped.\u00a0 Adding to the boiling pot were even more
                        gadgets and even more complicated combat moves that you
                        had to remember in order to beat certain baddies.\u00a0
                        Overall, I think they over-complicated a sound concept
                        that could\u2019ve done a lot better.\u00a0 If you
                        played the first game and are thinking about getting

                          first or until they release a copy with the DLCs
                          included.<\/p>\n

                                        entire cities before your eyes.\u00a0
                                        The characters are ones that you can
