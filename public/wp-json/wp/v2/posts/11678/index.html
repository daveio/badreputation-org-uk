            A <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/programmes\/b006qk11\"><strong
              >Moral Maze<\/strong><\/a> came on the radio, aiming to address
              the moral challenges around the government&#8217;s <a
              href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-politics-18881046\">Troubled

              women in these families should be financially discouraged from
              having more children if they are struggling to cope at present.
              This comes off the back of Eric Pickles saying we&#8217;re too
              politically correct to lay blame where it belongs, which is with
              the troubled families where recidivistic criminality and truancy
              endures across several generations.<\/p>\n
              <p>
                It is, they suggest, a moral failure of the families who
                languish on benefits that they do not lift themselves out of
                antisocial behaviour and state dependency.<\/p>\n

                  &#8220;we all know who these families are&#8221; when panel
                  members asked for clarification on whether they were
                  discussing troubled or troublesome families.<\/p>\n
                  <p>
                    The criteria for being regarded as a Troubled Family are
                    that a family has five or more of the following seven
                    traits:<\/p>\n
                  </p>

                    <li>Parents who have no qualifications<\/li>\n</li>

                    <li>
                      The family is unable to afford basics, including food and

                              some very loaded terms like &#8220;serial
                              fatherlessness&#8221; which seemed to point quite
                              firmly to where they apportion the blame for this
                              supposed crisis.<\/p>\n

                                Of course, like most government statistics, the

                                this definition is disputed, with most attempts
                                to replicate the research finding far, far fewer
                                families than in the initial research.<\/p>\n

                                didn&#8217;t seem to pick up on what seems to be
                                glaringly obvious to me as a major issue with
                                the defining traits, focusing instead on whether
                                poverty caused families to struggle to the point
                                where adhering to social norms was difficult or
                                whether the families themselves were essentially
                                lazy or immoral enough to drive themselves into
                                this situation. There are obvious echoes to the
                                description of &#8220;feral youths&#8221; we had
                                a year ago when the country was ablaze with
                                rioting.<\/p>\n
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                To me, the most pernicious aspect of the
                                definition is the bias against disabled people,
                                particularly against disabled women. Since
                                it&#8217;s far harder for disabled people to
                                find decent education or well-paid employment,
                                and since depression and other mental health
                                challenges are incredibly common among disabled
                                people (perhaps because we&#8217;re being told
                                that our problems are our own moral
                                inadequacies?), it seems like a given that most
                                families where one or both parents are disabled
                                are automatically well on the way to being
                                labelled as problematic.<\/p>\n
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                In fact, if you examine a family where neither
                                parent is ill, disabled or has mental health
                                problems, they must meet all five of the
                                remaining criteria, but a disabled family where
                                the mother has mental health issues need only
                                meet three of the five non-health-related
                                factors to be labelled as problematic.<\/p>\n
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                If you then add in the idea that the mothers in
                                troubled families should be discouraged, perhaps
                                financially, from having more children than they
                                can afford or cope with, we&#8217;re worryingly
                                close to a programme of eugenics that
                                disproportionately targets disabled and mentally
                                ill women.<\/p>\n

                                  this point, seemingly assuming that it should

                                  impairment, whether physical or mental,
                                  constitutes a problem for society.<\/p>\n
                                  <p>
                                    It&#8217;s a disturbingly regressive idea
                                    that in order to end poverty, you end the

                                    Reading through earlier government documents
                                    relating to this, however, paints a
                                    different picture to the one now being
                                    presented by ministers. The definition there
                                    ran:<\/p>\n
                                  </p>
                                  <ul>

                                      First, examine families where either there
                                      is proof of the child having committed a
                                      crime or where a member of the family has
                                      an ASBO or similar charge around social
                                      conduct.<\/li>\n

                                      Secondly, identify families where a child
                                      has been regularly excluded from school,
                                      has 15% or higher unauthorised absence or
                                      where the child is regularly
                                      truanting.<\/li>\n
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                      If families meet one of the two, then
                                      examine if no-one in the family works or
                                      is in post-compulsory education (one of
                                      those NEETs &#8211; Not in Employment,
                                      Education or Training).<\/li>\n

                                      After examining these identifying factors,
                                      local considerations may be applied where
                                      families meet two or three of the above
                                      factors exist and there is cause for
                                      concern.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n

                                        These local considerations can
                                        include:<\/p>\n
                                      </p>

                                          police have been called out regularly,
                                          where the family is involved in a gang

                                            Now, this list of issues seems
                                            problematic, but less so when you
                                            take into account the idea that
                                            these should only be considered once
                                            it&#8217;s established that there
                                            are problems with criminality or
                                            where the child is not attending
                                            school often enough. Worklessness is
                                            given less priority than these and
                                            health problems such as alchoholism
                                            are even less relevant.<\/p>\n

                                                I think that the shift from what
                                                this document describes to the
                                                seven traits of unsuccessful

                                                in determining the underlying
                                                ideology at play here. Rather
                                                than say that criminality and
                                                absence from school or the
                                                structure of employment,
                                                education or training are the
                                                main challenges facing families
                                                and requiring intervention,
                                                we&#8217;re left with the
                                                impression that there are
                                                wickedly immoral, lazy people,
                                                primarily the poor, disabled
                                                people and single mothers, who
                                                are tearing apart the fabric of
                                                the country.<\/p>\n

                                                The original notion &#8211; that
                                                families who are troubled and
                                                troubling through antisocial or
                                                criminal behaviour, where
                                                children are being denied the
                                                life chances that education
                                                provides, could do with
                                                additional support and
                                                intervention to assist them in
                                                re-introducing structure to what
                                                can often be a chaotic and
                                                fraught existence &#8211; seems
                                                sound. To turn this into yet
                                                another attack on poor people,
                                                disabled people and women just
                                                seems like a moral failure of
                                                government, and that, I think,
                                                is far more likely to tear the
                                                country apart.<\/p>\n
