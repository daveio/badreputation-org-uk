    >Team BadRep were sent a writing prompt this month:
    <em
      >What is your favourite film or TV series, and why? If it\u2019s what
      you\u2019d call \u2018feminist-friendly\u2019, what about it appealed? If
      it isn\u2019t, how does that work for you, and are there nonetheless
      scenes, characters and so on that have stayed with you and continue to
      occupy a soft spot for you as a feminist pop culture
      adventurer?<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n
      <p>
        I&#8217;m a movie geek who (along with several of Team BadRep)
        can&#8217;t possibly choose only one favourite film. It&#8217;d take me
        a month just to narrow it down to a top 20. In the end I wrote about two
        films &#8211; this first one precisely because it&#8217;s pretty
        indefensible from a feminist point of view, and the second &#8211; which
        I&#8217;ll get to in tomorrow&#8217;s post &#8211; because I think it is
        <em
          >very<\/em> feminist in a genre where you don&#8217;t expect it.
          <\/p>\n
          <p>
            But I also think this choice, my first, has some hidden feminist
            aspects:<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_5739\" style=\"width: 217px\"

            <strong
              >Excalibur<\/strong>. We&#8217;re firmly into &#8216;Knights In
              Armour&#8217; territory here, which means the usual relegation of
              women to being prizes to be fought over, silent Queens, or love
              interests whose own opinions aren&#8217;t asked for, and
              absolutely nothing else. There&#8217;s a debate about whether
              showing this dynamic is itself feminist if you use it to highlight
              how unequal and appalling the situation was for women historically
              (HBO&#8217;s recent series<strong>
                Game of Thrones<\/strong> is reigniting this argument, although
                the source material books for that one are clearer: they start
                from a position of female oppression and have several characters
                rebel against it precisely
                <em
                  >because<\/em> of the extreme power difference, and makes the
                  readers acknowledge and dislike the inequality).<\/p>\n
                  <p>
                    At first glance though,
                    <strong
                      >Excalibur <\/strong>isn&#8217;t even trying for feminism
                      points. Its famous heroes are a male King and a male
                      Wizard, some men who all get to be equal to other men
                      around a table, and a man who starts a war over someone
                      else&#8217;s wife. And everything goes to hell when one of
                      the few named women sleeps with the man she actually
                      loves. <\/p>\n
                      <p>
                        Looking at the main female characters in detail, we have
                        <strong
                          >Igraine<\/strong> who is a pouting, mostly naked
                          object of lust, and played by (somewhat creepily)
                          director John Boorman\u2019s daughter Katrine. She is
                          famously &#8211; and this causes wincing every time
                          &#8211; naked while being given loving attentions by a
                          man in full plate-mail (surely that would
                          chafe?!).<\/p>\n
                          <p>
                            We also have
                            <strong
                              >Guinevere<\/strong>, played excellently by<strong>
                                Cherie Lunghi<\/strong> as someone spirited, but
                                increasingly trapped and fragile. I don\u2019t
                                think it counts as a spoiler to reveal that
                                Guinevere falls in love with Lancelot. The fact
                                that she chooses to act on it in defiance of the
                                strict rules around sexual conduct could be seen
                                as empowering (even if it does result in her
                                being sentenced to death, from which she has to
                                be rescued by him).<\/p>\n
                                <p>
                                  And we have&#8230;
                                  <strong
                                    >Morgana<\/strong>. Played by

                                        Which is the point at which the film
                                        redeems itself a hell of a lot.
                                        It&#8217;s not just the power of the
                                        performances (several of which are
                                        brilliant despite the very-1980 effects
                                        and pomp) it&#8217;s that as well as
                                        being the best cinematic retelling of
                                        popular Arthurian Legend even today, the
                                        movie is filled with iconic archetypes,
                                        and they stand out way beyond the
                                        plot.<\/p>\n
                                      </p>

                                        We\u2019re reaching a bit to find any
                                        feminism in the movie up to this point,
                                        I agree. The source material was put
                                        together (in the<a

                                        it&#8217;s not surprising that

                                        Whether this movie counts as having a
                                        strong positive female lead eventually
                                        depends entirely on whether you think
                                        the archetype of The Witch is a positive
                                        one.<\/p>\n
                                      </p>

                                        Morgana is absolutely the classic
                                        dangerous magical female. She\u2019s
                                        immensely threatening: ambitious,
                                        capable, cunning, sexual, malevolent,
                                        but also completely outside the rules.
                                        She uses seduction as a weapon, and is
                                        utterly transgressive \u2013 her hate
                                        drives her to sleep with Arthur (her
                                        half-brother) and have a child
                                        (Mordred). This in turn breaks the

                                            is also chaotic and mysterious, but
                                            very careful to stay within the
                                            boundaries. Morgana is not. She is
                                            uncontrolled and uncontrollable,
                                            stronger than the King, and stronger
                                            than Merlin (and she proves it in
                                            both cases). She

                                              path of vengeance in the first
                                              place. She is owned by no man,
                                              with her own desires and plans for
                                              her family to gain power. And she
                                              succeeds at a great deal of

                                                to raise the banner of feminism
                                                very high when this character is
