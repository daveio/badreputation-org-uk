  Are you all sitting comfortably?<\/h3>\n
  <p>
    &#8216;Well, well,&#8217; I thought, as I cast my eye over the (now somewhat
    bedraggled) series of scrawled lists of letters for the Alphabet shoved into
    my pockets, bursting out of purses and sketchbooks and rotating in scarcely
    less tatty form in my head. For the question was obvious: What am I going to
    do for F? Because, you see, Z, Y, X, all those, they&#8217;re not actually
    that hard. They don&#8217;t have that much riding on them. But F &#8230;
    well, from the various incarnations of the F-word onwards &#8230; a
    headache.<\/p>\n
  </p>
  <p>
    Because, you see,\u00a0the word
    <em
      >feminism<\/em><em>
        <\/em>just isn&#8217;t that interesting.<\/p>\n
        <p>
          Or rather, its interest lies in its power to evoke wide-ranging,
          frequently violent reactions while remaining semantically
          straightforward.\u00a0<em
            >Feminism<\/em><em>
              <\/em>gets precisely a centimetre of a three-column page in the
              Shorter Oxford English Dictionary. Because it means two very
              simple and uncontentious things: in rare form, &#8216;the
              qualities of women&#8217;, and as it is more commonly understood
              today, &#8216;advocacy of the claims and rights of women&#8217;,
              first used sometime around 1895. All those extra things, the bad
              reputation &#8230; those are add-ons, and not linguistically valid
              ones, either. So I turned my attention away from\u00a0<em
                >feminism<\/em>, and thought that perhaps I would go back to
                basics. After all, how often do we think about what\u00a0<em
                  >female<\/em><em>
                    <\/em>means?<\/p>\n

                              role, the male seahorse receives a parcel of eggs
                              from the female. Upon doing this, he sets out on
                              an aqueous pregnancy-journey, bearing his unborn
                              sea-foals in a pouch specially evolved for the
                              purpose. During incubation, the female what

                              catch-up (approximately six minutes), during which

                              (holding tails, doing a little pre-dawn dance,

                                    that the next place it shows up in the
                                    dictionary is in botany (1791), where it
                                    refers to the parts of the plant that bear
                                    fruit, or, in reference to &#8216;a blossom
                                    or flower&#8217;, &#8216;having a pistil and

                                    (slightly later: 1796). Of course,
                                    &#8216;perfect&#8217; plants are
                                    &#8216;bisexual&#8217; in that they possess
                                    both male and female parts (this latter, the
                                    &#8216;gynoecium&#8217;, literally meaning

                                      Alongside this specific development is an
                                      extremely general one: &#8216;consisting
                                      of females&#8217;, &#8216;pertaining to
                                      women&#8217; (the dictionary quotes Pope
                                      on &#8216;the force of female
                                      lungs&#8217;), and then
                                      &#8216;characteristic of womankind&#8217;
                                      in the seventeenth century and
                                      &#8216;womanish&#8217; in the eighteenth.
                                      It is curious that the usage here should
                                      be &#8216;<em
                                        >womankind<\/em>&#8216; rather than

                                          human, and therefore arguably more
                                          subjective, than a simple reference to
                                          the egg-bearing species.<\/p>\n
