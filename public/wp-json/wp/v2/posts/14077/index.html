                        It&#8217;s a surreal concept, and one which is difficult
                        to write well, but Fraction has built a successful
                        career out of telling these kinds of stories, and is
                        skilled in persuading readers to suspend their
                        disbelief.<\/p>\n
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        In
                        <strong
                          >Sex Criminals<\/strong>, time is not presented as
                          strictly linear: events are shown out of sequence, and
                          the adult version of the lead character Suzie narrates
                          scenes from her adolescence, sometimes even appearing
                          next to her younger self on the page. This time-travel
                          effect makes it easier for the reader to accept
                          Suzie&#8217;s time-stopping powers, while also
                          establishing her as our link to the story.<\/p>\n
                          <p>
                            By choosing a female lead character, writer Fraction
                            is challenging popular culture&#8217;s tendency to
                            shy away from female leads, as well as the relative
                            taboo of women&#8217;s sexuality.<\/p>\n
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            In particular, his willingness to discuss female
                            masturbation is refreshing because, while male
                            wanking is openly discussed, joked about, and
                            accepted as a fact of life, there&#8217;s still a
                            lingering sense that it&#8217;s dirty when women do
                            it.<\/p>\n
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Early on in the comic, we see young Suzie
                            discovering the <a

                            bath, and it&#8217;s dealt with in a sensitive, not
                            overtly-eroticised way &#8211; adult Suzie,
                            narrating while fully clothed and perched on the
                            edge of the bathtub, is the focus of the

                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Although we are aware that young Suzie is
                            masturbating in this scene, the aim is not to
                            sexualise her but to introduce her orgasm-related
                            superpower, so the masturbation is less important
                            than what happens immediately afterwards. In a
                            pastiche of the old comics trope of an ordinary kid
                            acquiring superpowers when they hit puberty, Suzie
                            realises that time stops when she comes. Here,
                            Fraction takes an inspired dig at the state of sex
                            education in American schools, because Suzie has no
                            idea whether her experience is normal, and
                            she&#8217;s forced to rely on the dubious wisdom of
                            a classmate when the adults won&#8217;t answer her
                            questions.<\/p>\n
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Despite this, Suzie eventually becomes more
                            confident about sex, and it&#8217;s made very clear
                            to the reader that when she has sex with a partner
                            it&#8217;s her choice to do so. As the narrator, she
                            informs us that the first time she slept with her
                            high school boyfriend Craig she had decided to do so
                            in advance, and we see her enjoy the experience,
                            even though it doesn&#8217;t live up to her
                            expectation that it would be a profound,
                            life-changing event. From a feminist point of view,
                            the most interesting of the comic&#8217;s sex scenes
                            is Suzie&#8217;s first encounter with Jon, who has
                            just been introduced as the love interest. Jon
                            explicitly checks for consent before initiating
                            physical contact, in a way that seems natural,
                            relaxed, and pretty damn sexy.<\/p>\n

                            The admirable gender politics of the writing are
                            perfectly complemented by Zdarsky&#8217;s art, which
                            fits perfectly with a comic which is played for
                            laughs as much as for titillation. It isn&#8217;t
                            drawn in an overtly erotic style, and there
                            isn&#8217;t as much nudity as you might expect. The
                            fact that the art isn&#8217;t wank-bank material in
                            and of itself highlights the more cerebral aspects
                            of Suzie&#8217;s attraction to Jon; they fancy one
                            another, but their interest is sparked by shared
                            interests over looks.<\/p>\n
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            The art is also key to conveying the comic&#8217;s
                            humour, whether it&#8217;s in Craig&#8217;s
                            ridiculous gurning expression when he&#8217;s frozen
                            in time right at the point of orgasm, or the crude
                            drawings of nonsensical sex acts that Rachelle uses
                            to explain \u201cthe real raw sex shit\u201d to
                            teenage Suzie. There are also a range of less
                            obvious visual gags worked into the art in
                            backgrounds or on characters&#8217; clothes,
                            including numerous references to a celebrity called
                            \u201cSexual Gary\u201d who appears to be a pin-up
                            figure for teenage girls.<\/p>\n<p

                              >Sex Criminals<\/strong> is a very funny comic, it
                              also has emotional depth. The scenes from
                              Suzie&#8217;s adolescence aren&#8217;t solely
                              about her sexual development, but also deal with
                              her father&#8217;s sudden death and her
                              mother&#8217;s difficulty in coping afterwards.
                              Young Suzie&#8217;s reactions are balanced by the
                              narration from her adult self, creating a richer
                              and more satisfying narrative.<\/p>\n

                                Sex comedies can often disappoint feminists, but

                                  >Sex Criminals<\/strong> shows that writers
                                  don&#8217;t have to rely on tired sexist
                                  stereotypes when writing jokes about sex, and
                                  that decent gender politics don&#8217;t have
                                  to be po-faced and humourless. Whether
                                  you&#8217;re a devoted comics fan or simply
                                  curious, this one is definitely worth a
