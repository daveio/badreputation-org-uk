  half-mythologised figures straight out of the legends of the American West. <a

  shooting things up in Tombstone. One name that may not come to mind but really
  should is that of
  <strong
    >&#8216;Stagecoach&#8217; Mary Fields<\/strong> &#8211; the most hardcore
    postal worker of the last 200 years.<\/p>\n
    <p>
      Mary Fields was born into slavery in Tennessee sometime around 1832, the
      exact year being uncertain. Not too much is recorded about this phase of
      her life, other than, apparently, a fondness for physical altercations and
      bad homemade cigars. (Let\u2019s just stop and consider what a badass
      figure Fields must have cut, standing six feet tall, well muscled, and
      puffing away on a cheap cigar.)<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      It\u2019s a few decades after the abolition of slavery in the US that the
      really interesting part of Fields\u2019 story begins. Around 1884 she
      moved to Cascade, Montana and sought employment with a group of <a
      href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ursulines\">Ursuline<\/a> nuns
      there. She signed on to do the heavy labour &#8211; hauling freight, stone
      work, carpentry, that sort of thing. She stayed here for a while,
      eventually becoming forewoman.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      One somewhat apocryphal story from this era tells of Fields\u2019 freight
      wagon being overturned and attacked by wolves. Fields holed up in the
      wagon overnight, keeping the wolves at bay with her rifle and revolver,
      bringing the cargo in safely the following morning. Whilst this story may
      or may not be accurate what is undeniable is that the Great Falls Examiner
      (the only paper in the area) records Fields as being the cause of more
      broken noses than anyone else in town. She had little patience for the
      often inappropriate ways of men in frontier towns, and no problem with
      defending herself.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Why did she leave? Well, remember that fondness for fights? Yeah, she
      ended up having a gunfight with a coworker. He had complained that she
      earned $2 more than him, despite her being black and female. She dealt
      with this the way all sensible people deal with workplace disputes &#8211;
      she tried to shoot him. She missed on the first shot, a gunfight broke
      out, the bishop\u2019s laundry was damaged, and Fields found herself out
      of a job.<\/p>\n

    <p>
      So Fields moved on, applying for a job with the United States Postal
      Service. She was around 60 at this point, and being a mail carrier was not
      an easy job. Riding between frontier communities, living on the road in
      all extremes of weather, dealing with outlaws and wild animals; this was
      not a job for the faint of heart. But Fields impressed in the interview,
      being the fastest applicant to hitch a team of horses, and so the job was
      hers. This made her the second woman and the first African American woman
      to work for the Postal Service.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      So reliable was Fields, living up to the postal service\u2019s unofficial
      motto of being stayed by \u201cNeither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of
      night,\u201d that she picked up the nickname &#8216;Stagecoach&#8217;.
      Along with her mule, Moses, she spent the next decade or so carrying mail
      out to frontier outposts and remote mining posts. <\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      In the winters Montana gets some serious snow. On more than one occasion
      the trails would become impassable to horses because of the depth of snow
      drifts. When you\u2019re pushing 70, there\u2019s snow too deep for horses
      to pass, and miles to the next outpost, you stay at home and drink by the
      fire, right? No, of course not, not when you\u2019re Stagecoach Mary
      Fields you don\u2019t. She pressed on through with the mail over one
      shoulder and her rifle over the other, walking up to 10 miles between
      outposts and depots to ensure the mail arrived on time.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything has to end eventually though, and around 1902 she retired from
      the Postal Service to settle down in the town of Cascade. The nuns helped
      her buy a laundry business, but she never really enjoyed working there.
      Her two loves by this time in her life were the local baseball team, for
      whom she often grew flowers, and drinking in the town bar, still smoking
      those homemade cigars.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Just because she\u2019d settled down, though, doesn\u2019t mean Mary
      Fields lost any of the grit and pugnacity that had served her all her
      life. One customer, according to stories, failed to pay his laundry bill
      on time. Fields, drinking in the bar, heard him talking outside. Excusing
      herself from her drinking companions she stepped outside and decked him
      with one solid blow to the jaw. She may have been in her mid 70s by this
      point but Stagecoach Mary Fields was not a woman with whom one messed. The
      satisfaction of seeing the guy laid out, so she said, was more than worth
      the price of the laundry bill.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1914, after a hard-lived life, Fields&#8217;s liver finally gave out.
      Her neighbours buried her in Cascade&#8217;s Hillside cemetery, and for a
      while her birthday was an unofficial holiday, with the town\u2019s schools
      being closed to celebrate her.<\/p>\n
