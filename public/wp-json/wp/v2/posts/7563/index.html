          >Hey Rox, thanks for talking to us. What do you think is the struggle
          for women in terms of the impact of these cuts? Obviously
          &#8220;women&#8221; aren&#8217;t a monolithic or homogenous group, but
          is there a distinct fight?<\/strong><\/p>\n
          <p>
            &#8220;The full scale of the public sector cuts <a
            href=\"http:\/\/www.fawcettsociety.org.uk\/index.asp?PageID=1195\">fall
            in a way that is unbalanced in terms of gender<\/a>. Women make up
            most of the public sector jobs being cut, women rely most heavily on
            public services and on certain benefits that are being cut, and
            where vulnerable people like children, the disabled and the elderly
            are stripped of their governmental support, it has historically been
            women that step in to bridge the gap and become carers.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            &#8220;The cuts attack services that women depend on in order to
            live \u2018equally\u2019 with men, services that are there to
            compensate for existing gender inequalities &#8211; Rape Crisis
            centres and helplines, SureStart and childcare benefits. These are
            not privileges. Many women rely on these services. Without them, the
            progress that past generations have made by fighting to get us this
            far is being unnecessarily sacrificed. The cuts will push us back in
            time in terms of women\u2019s rights and equality.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            &#8220;I don\u2019t believe the struggle is distinct &#8211; this is
            a fight that everyone should be fighting &#8211; but we should be
            aware of what we are fighting for and what we, as women, truly stand
            to lose. The message out there is not clear enough yet \u2013 as
            these cuts fall, they will cut through the progress women have made.
            <\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            &#8220;The problem is, because of existing sexism within our society
            and a scepticism towards \u2018feminism\u2019, it is still so hard
            to have conversations about women and the inequality we struggle
            with. I believe we need more and more great acts of exciting and
            inviting civil disobedience to get people thinking seriously about
            gender and the cuts.&#8221;<\/p>\n

                the police yes. Of course. In the most extreme sense, my
                personal experience of being arrested was interesting in terms
                of my treatment as a woman. The fact that I am young and female
                was repeatedly used against me, as a way to make me feel
                inferior. Of course, that&#8217;s often what the police aim to
                do with any arrestee; to intimidate and isolate. But after
                talking to male activists, it seems to me that the treatment is
                often different if you are a woman in custody. <\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                &#8220;I was arrested by a woman. She commented frequently on my
                appearance, asking things like, \u201cDo you never brush your
                hair?\u201d and when I was asked if this was my natural hair
                colour, she pulled at my roots and answered on my behalf,
                \u201cNo.\u201d A friend of mine was arrested at the same time,
                and the woman arresting her was even worse. She searched through
                her backpack, pulled out a pair of underwear and pulled a face
                like she was disgusted to be holding them. She stretched them
                out and waved them in the faces of the male officers around, who
                seemed genuinely embarrassed and uncomfortable at the treatment
                this woman was giving my friend.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                &#8220;It wasn\u2019t any better when I was in the cell. I was
                not allowed to use my own tampon, and when I asked for a new one
                I was told the police station didn\u2019t keep any. I was then
                given one hours later, which I had to use until I was released
                after 24 hours. Why don\u2019t police stations have to stock
                tampons? They have to go out any buy you food if you have
                special requirements. I was also told I had to be watched
                closely as I inserted the tampon, which I later found out did
                not happen to other female activists in different stations.
                Taking away human rights as basic as this seems like just one
                more way to reduce an arrestee to a more helpless and regretful
                position.&#8221;<\/p>\n

                  action your first foray into public protest?<\/strong><\/p>\n
                  <p>
                    &#8220;I was involved in environmental activism before UK
                    Uncut, and that is where I learned about the use of direct
                    action as a political tactic. I also learned how to use the
                    consensus model of decision making which empowers each
                    individual to have their say and play an equal part in the
                    movement. These skills have been invaluable to me in every
                    action I have been involved in. <\/p>\n
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    &#8220;I felt that I had to do something to try and stop the
                    government cutting the services that I am most proud of,
                    that society\u2019s most vulnerable people rely on to live
                    in this country. I used to be proud of the structures we had
                    built here to support our population- we built the NHS when
                    we had a bigger deficit than we have today. We should all be
                    proud of such universal services, and we shouldn\u2019t give
                    up the fight and watch as they are all sold off to
                    profit-making companies.&#8221;<\/p>\n
