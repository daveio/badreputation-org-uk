  So it turns out that the Brotherhood really
  <em
    >are<\/em> watching you.<\/p>\n
    <p>
      I rolled in to work today, sleep-deprived and with a quiff resulting from
      three days&#8217; worth of hair product build-up, to find that <a
      href=\"http:\/\/ubiworkshop.myshopify.com\/blogs\/news\/2653802-home-made-assassin\">the
      Ubisoft Workshop had linked to my previous post about sex
      Assassins<\/a>.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, I&#8217;ve told you previously that the
      <strong
        >Assassin&#8217;s Creed<\/strong> franchise is my opiate. As anyone who
        has met me can confirm, the mere brush upon the subject of the games is
        enough to send me into a dreadful foam. My boss&#8217;s son, a kid of
        only 11, paled when subjected to my enthusiastic anecdotes of dumping
        masses and masses of dead guards into haystacks. I&#8217;m<em>
          stupid <\/em>over it.<\/p>\n
          <p>
            Imagine my delight, then, when I found out I&#8217;d been linked to
            by the
            <em
              >Ubisoft Goddamn Workshop!<\/em> Imagine the shrieking. Imagine
              the foaming. Imagine the looks on my poor, long-suffering
              co-workers&#8217; faces as I explained the situation to them in
              what increasingly became a sort of hyperactive semaphore. Ubisoft
              Workshop!! Where most of my paypacket goes each month! Where you
              can, for the princely sum of five Canadian dollars, order a copy
              of the spin-off comic
              <strong
                >Assassin&#8217;s Creed: The Fall<\/strong> and have it arrive
                on your doorstep in an Ubisoft envelope
                <em
                  >and then die of glee.<\/em><\/p>\n
                  <p>You know, hypothetically. Er.<\/p>\n</p>
                  <p>
                    Anyway, I&#8217;m pretty chuffed. But I think, therefore,
                    that&#8217;s it&#8217;s time to iron out a few kinks and go
                    into the depth I couldn&#8217;t plumb in my first article
                    because I had a wordcount to stick to and a point to make.
                    Ready? Good. Let&#8217;s go.<\/p>\n<div

                            My boyfriend, bless him, bought me the Extra Super

                              cards of all the character classes! After
                              wrenching myself down off the ceiling, I was
                              extremely pleased to note that quite a few of the

                              all of them are courtesans. This is good. We have
                              a nice library of stabby-bastard women to chose
                              from, and they&#8217;re believably solid and
                              real-looking, and I&#8217;m totally convinced that
                              they could fuck guards and Templars up just as
                              well as everyone else you&#8217;re given to play
