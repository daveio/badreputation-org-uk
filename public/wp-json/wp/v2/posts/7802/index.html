Post] Thoughts on Women in LARP"},"content":{"rendered":"
<p>
  <em
    >A while ago we asked you all what you enjoy doing with your time, and
    whether you had any thoughts on your hobbies from a gender perspective. A
    fair few of you got in touch, and following on from Jo&#8217;s post on black
    metal yesterday, here&#8217;s Al on the soapbox&#8230;<\/em><\/p>\n
    <p>
      &#8220;That&#8217;s pretty geeky,&#8221; laughs the guy in the pub.
      &#8220;I bet you don&#8217;t get many girls doing that!&#8221;<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      I sigh inwardly. I&#8217;ve just outed myself as a Live-Action Roleplayer,
      and although he&#8217;s never heard of it before, my drinking partner
      instantly knows that all larpers are young, socially awkward, computer
      programmers, and male.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      If you don&#8217;t know what larp is, it&#8217;s often somewhere between
      <strong
        >Dungeons &#038; Dragons<\/strong>,
        <strong
          >World of Warcraft<\/strong> and amateur dramatics. We dress, act and
          speak as our character &#8211; so mages cast spells using vocals, and
          combat is resolved using specially-made &#8220;safe&#8221; weapons to
          hit each other. Sound silly? Damn right, and a great deal of fun
          too.<\/p>\n
          <p>
            I&#8217;ve been larping for 16 years, and although many systems and
            genres exist, I mostly enjoy standard &#8220;fantasy&#8221;
            settings, with warriors, wizards, trolls and the like. A game might
            be 8 friends playing in a local wood, or several thousand at the
            largest of the weekend fest events.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <h3>
            Rules and Regulations<\/h3>\n
            <p>
              What&#8217;s it like larping as a woman? Well, there&#8217;s the
              rules, for a start.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              The rules of a system cover combat mechanics, magic systems and
              character creation. Superficially, for the past 15 years these
              have been gender neutral. In every system I have played, skill
              sets are available to any gender &#8211; a woman can play a
              battle-hardened warrior, just as much as a man can play a one-hit
              healer.<\/p>\n

              data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/a>Larp is a physical sport, and other
              restrictions have far more impact upon your character choices than
              gender. L has been larping for nearly 20 years. &#8220;If you
              don&#8217;t have the physical ability, you are far more restricted
              from playing a tank than if you are a woman,&#8221; she says.
              &#8220;In my experience, what affects somebody&#8217;s ability the
              most is personality: a combination of being larger than life, able
              to take initiative, play your character, and be part of a
              team.&#8221;<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              As well as the rules, game creators invent the world into which
              characters must be placed, and these can come with social
              prejudices. Usually these are fantastical (&#8220;We hate the
              unliving!&#8221;) but a few reflect more real-world issues. For
              example, a society might be defined as &#8220;matriarchal&#8221;,
              such as many of the Drow from the <a
              href=\"http:\/\/www.lorientrust.com\/Homepage.aspx\">Lorien
              Trust<\/a> events, or the Tritoni from <a
              href=\"http:\/\/www.profounddecisions.co.uk\/profounddecisions\/HomePage?0\">Profound
              Decisions<\/a>&#8216; Maelstrom system.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              Is this a problem? Perhaps. Cultural distinctions add flavour to a
              game, but by singling them out, other cultures risk being tarred
              as &#8220;patriarchal&#8221; by default. But players who
              don&#8217;t wish to interact with these issues in their games can
              usually opt out.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              &#8220;I&#8217;m fine with <a
              href=\"http:\/\/www.profounddecisions.co.uk\/maelstrom?1\">Maelstrom<\/a>,
              where there are a couple of cultures with strongly ingrained
              gender roles,&#8221; says R. &#8220;I can simply avoid playing a
              member of either culture and there is still a lot of game
              available. I don&#8217;t want to stop other people roleplaying
              gender politics just because it&#8217;s not something that
              interests me.&#8221;<\/p>\n

              Young, Geeky Men<\/h3>\n
              <p>
                Larpers should be used to stereotypes &#8211; as we&#8217;ve
                already established, we&#8217;re all single, misanthropic male
                students, yes? Well, no. Larpers are doctors, lawyers and
                teachers (and, yes, students and computer programmers). We often
                started as students, but most of my University friends are still
                larping, and are happily partnered (usually to each
                other).<\/p>\n

                definitely right out. Women play at every level, both as players
                and game organisers, designers and plot writers.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                We have our own stereotypes. We&#8217;re familiar with the
                Metallica Warrior (rock t-shirt, black jeans, \u00a380 sword)
                and the Drunken Bum (turns up, drinks beer, smokes
                rollies).<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                Women in larp face stereotypes too. The most persistent is the
                &#8220;Healer Girlfriend&#8221;. She only came because her
                boyfriend insisted she&#8217;d enjoy it. The description is
                damning &#8211; you aren&#8217;t a proper character. Worse, your
                actions are only defined by a man, and you just exist to enhance
                his weekend (and act as a trophy for him to parade, of
                course).<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                R, who has been a key player and organiser in her local group
                for many years, agrees. &#8220;The stereotype is certainly
                sometimes accurate, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s fair
                because applying it is patronising and dangerous. Even to people
                it does apply to.&#8221;<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                Healer Girlfriends do exist, albeit briefly. &#8220;I
                effectively started at the <a
                href=\"http:\/\/lorientrust.com\/EventItem\/10-12-18\/The_Gathering_2011.aspx\">Gathering<\/a>
                as a Healer Girlfriend,&#8221; says L. &#8220;In my experience,
                one of two things quickly happens; either she gets bored and
                stops playing, or she finds her own game.&#8221; L found her own
                game, becoming one of the most renowned characters &#8211; and
                players &#8211; on the field. To call her a Healer Girlfriend
                now would be laughable.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                Another trope is the &#8220;Shelf&#8221; &#8211; the larper in a
                corset, often generously endowed, and invariably flaunting
                cleavage for (predominantly) male attention. Characters might
                resemble the likes of Ce&#8217;Nedra (from <a
                href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/David_Eddings\">David
                Eddings<\/a>&#8216;s novels), or Tika Waylan (from the <a
                href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dragonlance\">Dragonlance<\/a>
                books) &#8211; or some less salubrious counterpart. Are these
                roles compatible with calling larp a feminist-friendly sport?
                Personally, I&#8217;ve always struggled with this. Empowerment
                does not equate to equality.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                Ultimately I must have faith in those who choose to play these
                parts. We have a responsibility to resist stereotypes, and
                expect more from our fellow players. In film, the corset-wearing
                pretty girl is too often a bit-part to the male lead, but no
                larper writes a character in order to be part of the scenery. In
                your head, this story is all about
                <em
                  >you<\/em>. There&#8217;s a place for these heroes, and a
                  panoply of other characters, pleasant or otherwise &#8211; I
                  could count on one hand the characters I&#8217;ve played that
                  I wouldn&#8217;t detest if I met them in real life.<\/p>\n
                  <h3>
                    Real Life<\/h3>\n
                    <p>
                      Ah yes, real life. We tend to let our hair down at events.
                      Late at night, you&#8217;ll find more than a little
                      drinking, carousing and singing of some shockingly ribald
                      songs round the campfire. That said, larp events are, for
                      most, a safe, welcoming, accepting place to be.<\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      &#8220;I generally find male larpers polite and
                      gentlemanly,&#8221; says P. &#8220;I don&#8217;t remember
                      any instances of sexist behaviour, but then, I don&#8217;t
                      feel particularly vulnerable to that type of abuse, and
                      particularly these days I feel confident to challenge it
                      or ignore it. The main sexist type of behaviour is a
                      tendency towards protectiveness, but I don&#8217;t find
                      that offensive.&#8221;<\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      &#8220;I have had someone try to stop me doing heavy
                      lifting during setup and takedown because it&#8217;s a
                      &#8216;man&#8217;s job&#8217;.&#8221;, says R.
                      &#8220;That&#8217;s hardly related to larp. It&#8217;s a
                      piece of sexism ingrained into society in general, which
                      does need a kicking.&#8221;<\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Things have changed over the last 10 years, says P.
                      &#8220;The proportion of female to male larpers has
                      improved a lot in that time and changed the dynamics in
                      the field.&#8221;<\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Larping men seem more liberated. The Gathering is one of
                      the more child-friendly events; of the parents I counted
                      this year pushing prams or herding toddlers, nearly a
                      third of them were men. (Think that&#8217;s not good? Try
                      counting the same thing in your town centre tomorrow).
                      When there&#8217;s no social difference between genders,
                      there&#8217;s no pressure for women to &#8220;stay
                      home&#8221; whilst the men go out and fight the battles.
                      We draw our characters from fantasy, but women

                      <p>
                        In larp, you must physically represent &#8211;
                        <em
                          >physrep<\/em> &#8211; your character. Costume,
                          weaponry and armour is available to turn anyone into a
                          warrior or a wizard. However, a tall, balding,
                          overweight man can put on a pair of pointy ears and
                          call himself an elf, but he&#8217;ll be a tall,
                          balding, overweight elf none the less.<\/p>\n
                          <p>
                            Does this restrict a woman&#8217;s game? In other
                            forms of gaming, there&#8217;s nothing to stop you
                            playing a character of another gender, but this is
                            much harder in larp. Effectively portraying another
                            gender takes more care, physically and socially,
                            than most larpers are able to put in over the course
                            of a weekend in a tent. The easy option is to go
                            &#8220;panto&#8221; &#8211; fake breasts and
                            falsetto, or badly-drawn beards and that
                            testicle-airing stance of the &#8220;man&#8221;.
                            Such characters make me wince. They rely on
                            stereotypes &#8211; invariably negative &#8211; that
                            are almost always drawn from our out-of-character
                            world. Not only offensive, but immersion-breaking to
                            boot.<\/p>\n
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            That isn&#8217;t to say that gender-reversal
                            can&#8217;t be done well &#8211; it can. But for the
                            most part, a woman can only play female characters.
                            Does that really matter? I don&#8217;t think so. All
                            larpers make sacrifices over what they can play
                            &#8211; the overweight can never play svelte, the
                            clumsy can never play jugglers, the tone-deaf can
                            never play bards. P says she has never felt
                            restricted in her character choices by her gender.
                            &#8220;Physical ability has been a much bigger
                            restriction for me,&#8221; she says.<\/p>\n

                                pertinently, women can play characters with real
                                power. There is no glass ceiling. A woman
                                playing a warrior will be judged and accepted
                                not on her gender, but on how well she can wield
                                a sword and shield. In <a
