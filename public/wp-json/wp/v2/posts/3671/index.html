<p>Russia, 1942. Not a good place to be. <\/p>\n</p>
<p>
  A year into the war with Germany, the German 6<sup
    >th<\/sup> Army surrounding Stalingrad, millions dead and countless more
    dying of starvation and disease. Supplies and equipment were running low and
    the need for people to throw into combat was soaring. These were the
    conditions that gave rise to some of the most daring and impressive pilots
    ever, the 588<sup
      >th<\/sup> Night Bomber Regiment, nicknamed the Night Witches by the
      German forces. The name alone pretty much conveys how ridiculously amazing
      these women were, but let\u2019s go into a bit more detail.<\/p>\n
      <p>
        Formed in October of 1941, the Night Witches were an all female bomber
        regiment tasked with precision bombing<sup

          bombing differs from strategic bombing in that the bombs are aimed for
          individual targets as opposed to mass releasing them over an area,
          resulting in less collateral damage. It&rsquo;s hard to do in the best
          of conditions, let alone an ageing biplane at night. \">1<\/a><\/sup>
          runs against German military targets. The formation of the group took
          some time, as the move to recruit female combat pilots had initially
          been rejected, with one recruiting officer quoted as saying
          \u201cThings may be bad but we&#8217;re not so desperate that
          we&#8217;re going to put little girls like you up in the skies. Go
          home and help your mother.\u201d This in spite of the fact that many
          young Russian women had more piloting experience than the pilots of
          the front line fighter regiments thanks to the Osoaviakhim, a
          paramilitary flying club that provided free training to Soviet boys
          and girls in the 1920s and 30s.<\/p>\n
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Soviet military officials then, as US military officials now,
              questioned whether it was strategically or morally appropriate to
              send women into combat. But the Night Witches proved to themselves
              and a skeptical country that their gender made no difference in
              the defense of one&#8217;s home.<\/p>\n

                1938 Rakova had taken part in a record breaking non-stop flight

                and lose altitude, forcing the three-woman crew to jettison
                everything they could to lose weight and gain height. Eventually
                Rakova herself parachuted out of the plane to allow her two
                co-pilots to complete the trip. Jumping out of a plane over

                      going through two years&#8217; worth of training in just
                      six months. Up to fourteen hours a day were spent in the
                      air, including night flights and simulated dogfights. By
                      June 1942, they were ready to fight against the formidable
                      might of the German invasion.<\/p>\n
                      <p>
                        The Night Witches were not a well equipped regiment.
                        Wearing hand-me-down uniforms from male pilots (boots
                        were reportedly stuffed with paper and fabric to make
                        them fit), they flew in aging Polikarpov PO-2 biplanes.
                        The PO-2s were about as basic as a plane could get and
                        still technically qualify as a plane. First built in
                        1928, they consisted of fabric strung over a wooden
                        frame, and lacked any but the most rudimentary of
                        instrumentation. There was no radio to communicate with
                        ground control, and navigation was done with a stopwatch
                        and a map \u2013 just a normal map, not even a flight
                        chart. The planes carried no guns and only had enough
                        weight allowance to take two bombs up on a flight,
                        forcing the Night Witches to make multiple sorties in a
                        single night, returning to base each time to collect
                        more bombs.<\/p>\n
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The one thing the PO-2 had going for it, and which the
                        Night Witches used to full effect, was its remarkable
                        maneuverability. With a top speed of around 95mph, the
                        plane was slower than the slowest speed a German fighter
                        could maintain (its stall speed), allowing them to pull
                        tight, evasive circles that the faster German craft
                        couldn\u2019t match. Combine this with the impressive <a
                        href=\"http:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nap-of-the-earth\">nap-of-the-earth<\/a>
                        piloting skills that allowed the Night Witches to get
                        closer to the ground than the planes of the Luftwaffe
                        could manage, and shooting down a PO-2 from the air
                        became a challenging prospect. There was, supposedly, a
                        promise to award an Iron Cross to any Luftwaffe pilot
                        who actually managed to bring down a Night Witch.<\/p>\n

                        fighters struggled to bring down the Night Witches (who
                        included Evgeniya Rudneva, left), the ground defences
                        proved rather more formidable. 6<sup
                          >th<\/sup> Army encampments were protected by what was
                          known as the \u2018circus of flak\u2019 \u2013
                          concentric rings of up to two dozen flak cannons and
                          searchlights. The traditional tactic for dealing with
                          this had been to fly directly towards the target and
                          hope to get your bombs away before the flak could
                          blast you out of the air. It wasn\u2019t the most
                          successful tactic. The Night Witches developed a far
                          more effective method for getting past the circus of
                          flak: flying in groups of three, two planes would
                          approach the target and wait for the searchlights to
                          pick them up. These two would then split apart and
                          manoeuvre around the target, drawing the attention of
                          the cannons. The third plane, having waited behind,
                          would cut their engines and glide in to deliver the
                          bombs. This was repeated until each of the three
                          planes had made a bombing run. The mind boggles at the
                          sheer level of stone-cold bravery needed to repeatedly
                          offer yourself as a distraction to dozens of flak
                          cannons, protected only by a flimsy frame of wood and
                          fabric, and to keep doing that night after
                          night.<\/p>\n

                            consisted of 80 flying crew, plus ground support. By
                            the end of the war they had collectively flown over
                            23,000 bombing runs. The surviving pilots had all
                            flown around 1,000 missions each by 1945 (for sake
