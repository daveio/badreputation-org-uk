  So, here&#8217;s a cigarette advert from several decades ago. Y&#8217;know,
  back before they knew cigarettes killed you and stuff. Also back when gender
  representations in advertising were even more terrible.<\/p>\n

  But hey, that was decades ago, right? That was from a time when people held
  far more dubious views, hell people had only recently stopped using tape worms
  as a miracle diet (<a
  href=\"http:\/\/vintagecatalog.net\/2009\/11\/19\/helpful-tapeworms\/\">no,
  seriously<\/a>). It was a less enlightened time, but we&#8217;ve moved on
  since then, yes?<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  Well, no, not so much. The world of advertising is still filled with dubious
  messages, awkward depictions of race and gender, and terrible division of
  products along gender lines (&#8220;This is a girl product! Make the packaging
  pink so they&#8217;ll buy it! This is a boy product! Fill the advert with
  explosions!&#8221;) So what we have here is a collection of half a dozen or so
  recent magazine adverts that have taken their attitudes straight from the
  1950s.<\/p>\n

    It was Mothers&#8217; Day in the US recently, and Mr Clean decided to run
    this advert for the occasion. Maybe I&#8217;m misinterpreting the advert.
    Maybe Mothers&#8217; Day in the US is a bit different to the UK. Either way,
    the apparent message of &#8220;Get back to the cleaning! And get your
    daughter to help, she needs to learn!&#8221; seems a little&#8230; well,
    off. <\/p>\n

      Goldstar Beer have an interesting view of how drinking works, one that
      manages to simultaneously insult both men and women. Women are complex and
      have to worry about matching their drinks (girly, fruity drinks,
      naturally) to their outfits, because they&#8217;re shallow like that. Men,
      meanwhile, are simple-minded creatures who are only capable of desiring
      one thing: beer. And not even good beer. Crappy mass-market beer. <\/p>\n

        It&#8217;s not just gender that advertising fails on either. Here we get
        a delightful intersection of gender and homophobia from the fine folks
        at Nike. Because ballet isn&#8217;t manly, you see, and you don&#8217;t
        want your son to do something that isn&#8217;t manly. Best buy him some
        Nike trainers as soon as you can and get him doing something macho like
        soccer, before the homosexuals lure him into their sordid world of
        energetic dance routines and toned calf muscles. Because that is totally
        how reality works. Yes.<\/p>\n

          Women, you see, are basically like magpies, only larger and incapable
          of flight. So not very good magpies. But like magpies, women are
          innately drawn to shiny shiny things; the shinier the better. And as
          DeBeers know, if you feed her craving for shiny objects then
          she&#8217;ll pretend to like you and sate your desperate need for
          validation. Which, of course, is all women are good for. (That and
          cooking you dinner, which is a talent the common magpie rarely excels

            Social values, 1950s style. Cooking, cleaning, caring for your
            child. These all start with C. More importantly, they&#8217;re all
            things that the wife does, because hey, it&#8217;s not like she has
            a job, right? Women in the workplace? Madness! And all of those
            things are time consuming; why, hiring someone to do them all would
            be fairly expensive. When your wife dies, you won&#8217;t be
            grieving over the loss of your life&#8217;s love, you&#8217;ll be
            wondering who&#8217;s going to make dinner if you can&#8217;t afford
            to hire a cook. So you&#8217;d better get life insurance out on her.
            Or, I guess, buy some diamonds and lure a magpie, either way.<\/p>\n

              I was going to say something bitingly snarky and witty, but&#8230;
              I just&#8230; wow. I&#8217;ve been defeated by this advert. Just
              imagine I said something hilarious and cutting and you&#8217;re
              all very entertained.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              So, defeated by that last advert, I&#8217;m going to stop here. I
              implore all of you to go out and get jobs in advertising and make
              better adverts than these, so that we can someday feature them in
