  >Beware, gentle reader! For this fair review contains those demons known as
  SPOILERS!! While they are not major plot spoilers, there is mention of Stuff
  That Matters, so if this causes your brow to sweat, TREAD CAREFULLY! And you
  might want to skip the entire review and just look at the picture at the
  bottom.<\/strong><\/p>\n
  <p>
    Father Christmas begins his judgement of whether or not potential gift
    recipients have been Naughty or Nice well back in February. January is his
    holiday month, where no paperwork is done. It all starts in February, that
    judgement process. He&#8217;s got a lot of people to get through, and the
    judgement of Naughty or Nice is perilous. Some people write him letters.
    That makes it easier; except those bastards who write something extolling
    how such a polarised morality system is flawed, and the whole concept of
    &#8220;Naughtiness&#8221; is subjective. These people usually get a lump of
    coal, a black top hat and the GPS location of my bedroom.<\/p>\n
  </p>
  <p>
    As you can imagine, the more Father Christmas can mass-judge and dispense
    identical recompense or reward &#8211; known as &#8220;blanketing&#8221;
    &#8211; the easier his job is. So any opportunity he has to reward an entire
    section of humanity in one go, he takes it. Of course he does.
    Wouldn&#8217;t you?<\/p>\n
  </p>
  <p>
    Anyway, that&#8217;s why
    <strong
      >Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows<\/strong> exists. Father Christmas
      noticed that an awful lot of people who had exhibited exemplary behaviour
      this year were linked by their communal desire to see
      <strong
        >Robert Downey Jnr.<\/strong> touch
        <strong
          >Jude Law<\/strong> with as much of his naked body as possible, and
          pulled a few strings at Warner Brothers &#8211; he has fingers in many
          pies, you see &#8211; and here we are.<\/p>\n
          <p>
            I got all this, incidentally, from a few of my double-agent elves
            stationed in his workhouse. I intend on repurposing his operation

                  >Sherlock Holmes 2<\/strong> (let&#8217;s call it that for
                  short) follows in the grand tradition of making Holmes and
                  Watson as blatantly married as possible without allowing them
                  to actually kiss. From my perspective as an audience member,
                  it looks almost like a
                  <em
                    >game<\/em> directors (in this case,
                    <strong
                      >Guy Ritchie<\/strong>) play: given that both Holmes
                      <em
                        >and<\/em> Watson have female love interests, how can
                        they convey just how deeply involved with each other
                        they are without resorting to boring, obvious techniques
                        such as having them snog or surreptitiously shag in a
                        train? Ritchie leaps the first hurdle &#8211; that of
                        the lady interlopers &#8211; with little difficulty. He
                        kills off Irene Adler (<strong
                          >Rachel McAdams<\/strong>) in a single scene with no
                          ambiguity or remorse. Thought she was fun and
                          interesting and looked forward to seeing more of her
                          in this film? Tough! Down she goes in a fit of
                          unceremonious bloody coughing under the impassive gaze
                          of Dr Moriarty (the terrifying
                          <strong
                            >Jared Harris<\/strong>) from behind a
                            teacup.<\/p>\n
                            <p>
                              Watson&#8217;s wife, Mary (<strong
                                >Kelly Reilly<\/strong>), though clearly a bit
                                of an unflappable, gun-cocking badass herself,
                                gets about ten lines in total, and is dressed up
                                and polished as a dreadful gooseberry to Watson
                                and Holmes&#8217;s gay domestic bliss.
                                It&#8217;s a shame, and, you know, I&#8217;d
                                hiss and spit about it more and about how it
                                seems that people are resentful of any
                                differently-gendered third party to a homoerotic
                                pairing (canon or not) as if any hint of
                                heterosexuality immediately ruins everything
                                like bisexuality or polyamory don&#8217;t

                                <p>
                                  I just penned a paragraph listing all of the
                                  things Holmes and Watson do or say to each
                                  other that could have been replaced wholesale
                                  with extended, visceral scenes of them
                                  fellating each other&#8217;s tongues, but then
                                  I ran out of recommended wordcount for the
                                  article and I don&#8217;t want to anger my
                                  editor. Suffice to say, it&#8217;s a lot,
                                  verging on ALL THINGS. You&#8217;re probably
                                  not very surprised. I did say the film was a
                                  reward for the RDJ\/JL cabal and the
                                  Holmes\/Watson contingent. That&#8217;s a lot
                                  of people who&#8217;ve been basically Mahatma
                                  Ghandi this year. Well done those
                                  people.<\/p>\n

                                  But it does bring me back to the point I
                                  always get up in my grill when I watch
                                  &#8220;bromances&#8221; such as this, and that
                                  is<em
                                    >: it&#8217;s not enough<\/em>. Don\u2019t
                                    you dare call this a queer film because it
                                    isn\u2019t. It
                                    <em
                                      >mollifies<\/em>, rather than actually
                                      addresses any visibility issues. It
                                      flirts, but is ultimately a bit of a
                                      cocktease. I know there&#8217;s the
                                      argument that emotionally intense (but not
                                      actually sexual) relationships between
                                      women get a lot of screen time in
                                      fictional media, and intimate inter-female
                                      friendships have a bigger presence in the
                                      collective conscience of Western culture
                                      (that group toilet trip thing, for
                                      instance) so it&#8217;s not fair that men
                                      can only slap each other tentatively on
                                      the back or &#8211; gasp! &#8211;
                                      they&#8217;ll be branded as
                                      &#8220;gay&#8221;, but what
