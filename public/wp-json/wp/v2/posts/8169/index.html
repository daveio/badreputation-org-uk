            I was the kid who thought &#8216;shoddy work&#8217; when comic book
            inkers coloured in panels of Wolverine&#8217;s costume the wrong
            colour. What do you expect will be my reaction when you try to sell
            me that and call it a Wolverine costume? The only time I&#8217;ve
            seen a male superhero wear a skirt that short was when Deadpool <a
            href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/10\/deadpool.jpg\">put
            on Jean Grey&#8217;s costume<\/a> and insisted he was an

                      those huge abs printed on it! No toning down the muscle
                      power for the ladies. Less good: The lines on the front
                      come over like a bra made out of sinew. Even She-Hulk does
                      not possess this feature.<\/p>\n

                          Anyway, I think this is one example among thousands of
                          the failure to translate power from a masculine to a

                                        flesh on display in this way? Sexy male
                                        costumes do exist, but they tend to be
                                        seen as much more out of place at a
                                        general house party than a woman in
                                        stockings and suspenders.<\/p>\n
