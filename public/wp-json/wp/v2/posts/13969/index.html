<p>
  In my ongoing quest for image-and-word combinations with female characters
  that aren&#8217;t made of boobs in jumpsuits, I&#8217;ve been doing some
  trawling of the internet for webcomics for your edu-tainment. Here&#8217;s
  some of the best of them.<\/p>\n

    \/><\/a> Yes, I found this by doing a lazy Google search after &#8220;decent
    webcomics that won&#8217;t make me scream&#8221; didn&#8217;t turn up
    anything useful. But it worked, and here we are. <a
    href=\"http:\/\/strongfemaleprotagonist.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong
      >Strong Female Protagonist<\/strong><\/a> by Brennan Lee Mulligan (writer)
      and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mollyostertag.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Molly
      Ostertag<\/a> (art) is a superheroine comic about an American teenager
      trying to deal with being an ex-superhero, her former comrades and
      enemies, and going to university whilst still having epic
      superpowers.<\/p>\n
      <p>
        There&#8217;s an X-Men-esque backdrop of mutation-hatred, and so she
        exists, like many superheroes, in a world that is not entirely happy
        about
        <em
          >having<\/em> superheroes. The black and white thick line art is
          really nice, I like the emphasis on characters&#8217; faces and
          expressions rather than bodies, and the themes of power,
          responsibility and morality are something I think the
          &#8220;super&#8221; genre is well-placed to tackle.<\/p>\n
          <p>
            The main exploration is, naturally enough, about what it means to be
            a Strong Female Protagonist, and links neatly to <a
            href=\"http:\/\/www.newstatesman.com\/culture\/2013\/08\/i-hate-strong-female-characters\"
            target=\"_blank\">this nice article on the subject in the New
            Statesman recently<\/a>. Yes, the lead character is
            &#8220;strong&#8221; &#8211; she&#8217;s a physical powerhouse, and
            strong-minded too. Her strength isn&#8217;t just physical, but also
            emerges in terms of her blunt decision-making and clearly held
            beliefs about right and wrong. Strength ostensibly defines her, but
            the comic is about the questions and complications behind what that
            might mean.<\/p>\n

            Delilah Dirk<\/h3>\n
            <p>
              I was absolutely bowled over by the quality of the artwork in <a
              href=\"http:\/\/www.delilahdirk.com\" target=\"_blank\"><strong
                >Delilah Dirk and the Turkish Lieutenant<\/strong><\/a>. The
                colouration is superb, and the detail in each of the panels
                makes the whole thing look absolutely lush: there&#8217;s a
                &#8220;classic story&#8221; feel to the whole piece, and the
                pages, like our titular heroine, are full of life and
                activity.<\/p>\n
                <p>
                  The comic is set in (sort of) Constantinople in 1805, and is
                  very much in the style of

                      wisecracking character in a gung-ho Sinbad the
                      Sailor-style universe, where bad guys are bad and the
                      goodies might do slightly naughty things, but it&#8217;s
                      all in a Robin Hood sort of way.<\/p>\n

                        and all tongues should remain in cheeks, except when
                        they&#8217;re lolling at the beautiful landscapes of <a

                          not particularly deep or meaningful, but hey, not all
                          narratives with female characters need to be about
                          what it is to be a female character, right? It&#8217;s
                          definitely a damn good yarn, and worth a look for the
                          art if nothing else.<\/p>\n

                                                It&#8217;s a huge, sprawling
                                                world, crammed full of
                                                interesting female characters.
                                                The story focuses on the central
                                                pair of Antimony and Katriona,
                                                who are best friends, and their
                                                experiences going to school and
                                                becoming part of a
                                                magical\/technological war which
                                                is threatening to move from cold
                                                to hot.<\/p>\n
