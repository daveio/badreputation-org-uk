<p>
  It\u2019s the middle of the 19th century, and you\u2019re the daughter of an
  Anglican clergyman living in rural Northern England. You\u2019ve spent most of
  your young life unwell (something described by one historian quoted, but not
  named on <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk\/WWbirdbishop.htm\">this
  site<\/a> as \u201cnot uncommon among intelligent women of the period, who
  were thwarted by lack of formal education and oppressed by constrictive social
  conventions&#8221;), and you\u2019ve just had a partially successful operation
  to remove a tumour from your spine, leaving you with insomnia and depression.
  The prospect of a life of quiet domesticity in the countryside bores you to
  tears. What do you do? If you\u2019re
  <strong
    >Isabella Bird<\/strong> (1831-1904) you get a \u00a3100 allowance and set
    off to North America by yourself to do something more interesting.<\/p>\n

      \/><\/a>Bird\u2019s first journey abroad, in 1854, was not the most
      adventurous trip of her life: she travelled around the Eastern US and
      Canada, mostly staying with relatives for the several months she was in
      North America. However, the trip sparked off the two key interests that
      would come to define much of her adult life, travelling and writing. She
      composed daily journal entries throughout the duration of her journey
      which &#8211; along with letters written to her younger sister Henrietta
      &#8211; formed the basis for her first book,
      <strong
        >The Englishwoman in America<\/strong>.<\/p>\n
        <p>
          Following her return to England and her father\u2019s death in 1858,
          Bird moved to Edinburgh with her mother and sister. As well as several
          shorter trips to the Americas, Bird made several journeys to the Outer
          Hebrides during this period, writing articles on the plight of the
          crofters there. She used some of the royalties from these articles to
          help crofters emigrate to the US.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          1868 saw the death of Bird\u2019s mother, and her sister\u2019s
          settling on the Isle of Mull. Loathing the quiet domestic lifestyle
          there, and finding it brought back her childhood illnesses, Bird
          planned a longer series of voyages. She set out first for Australia,
          and then in 1872 to Hawaii. There she climbed an active volcano and
          penned her next book. The money from that funded her travels on to
          Colorado, the most recent state to have joined the US. Her time in
          Colorado prompted another book,
          <strong
            >A Lady\u2019s Life in the Rocky Mountains<\/strong>, perhaps her
            best known work. Her adventures there were rather awesome, reading
            like the treatment for a movie. She befriended a charismatic
            one-eyed outlaw, Jim Nugent, a fan of poetry and casual violence.
            With his help she climbed Long\u2019s Peak and explored the Rockies.
            Bird caused some controversy by dressing in a sensible manner for
            her travels here, and riding astride instead of side-saddle, which
            ultimately lead to her threatening to sue the
            <strong
              >Times<\/strong> for accusing her of dressing &#8216;like a
              man&#8217;.<\/p>\n
              <p>
                Her return to England after the trip followed the same pattern
                as before. Horrified by the idea of a quiet home life, and with
                an offer of marriage from Edinburgh-based doctor John Bishop,
                she once again arranged for a journey abroad. This time she
                voyaged around East Asia, writing about her experiences in Japan
                and Malaysia amongst others. Her trip was cut short by the loss
                of her sister to typhoid in 1880, leaving Bird devastated. She
                agreed to marry Bishop but found the experience miserable, and
                began travelling again when he died in 1886.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                This time around, Bird decided she needed to do some good on her
                travels, and chose to travel to India as a missionary. Aged
                almost 60, she studied medicine, and arrived on the
                sub-continent in 1889. She roamed the area, visiting Tibet,
                Persia and Baghdad, taking with her a medicine chest and a
                revolver. (After all, you never know when it might be necessary
                to heal someone or shoot them.) She also established not one but
                two hospitals; the Henrietta Bird Hospital in Amritsar and the
                John Bishop Memorial Hospital in Srinigar. This is two more
                hospitals than most people ever get round to founding, and a
                pretty brilliant achievement.<\/p>\n<div style=\"width: 410px\"

              <p>
                Her journeys and writing had earned Bird a deal of fame in
                England, and in 1892 she became the first woman to be granted a
                fellowship with the prestigious Royal Geographic Society
                (presided over at the time by the fantastically named Sir
                Mountstuart Elphinstone Grant Duff). She met with Prime Minister
                William Gladstone and addressed a parliamentary committee to
                discuss the atrocities being committed against Armenian people
                in the Middle East at the time. Of course, this wasn\u2019t
                enough to sate her desire for travel and shortly afterwards she
                once again set off around the world.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                She travelled to East Asia again, seeing the Yokohama region of
                Japan and much of Korea, leaving only when forced to by the
                outbreak of the Sino-Japanese war. Rather than return home, she
                moved on to China. There, in addition to travelling up the
                Yangtze River and writing more, she was attacked by a mob and
                trapped in the top floor of a building that was then set on
                fire. Later she was stoned and left unconscious in the street.
                That\u2019s the sort of thing that might put a lot of people off
                travelling, but when she died in 1904 Bird had been in the
                middle of planning another trip to China, due to set off just
                after her 73rd birthday in October. Because no one as awesome as
                Bird lets a little mob violence deter them from going where they
                want to go.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                By the time of her death, Bird had circumnavigated the globe
                three times over, written over a dozen books and countless
                articles, and established herself as one of the most daring and
                best known travellers of the era. Many of her works can be found
                on Project Gutenberg <a
