      Monday 8th March, 1907. The Ladies&#8217; Gallery of the House of Commons
      is closed as a precaution as the Dickinson bill receives its second
      reading. The bill, which would see the enfranchisement of around a million
      propertied women in the UK, is talked out. In protest, the Women&#8217;s
      Social and Political Union (WSPU) decide to march on Westminster.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Twelve days later, several hundred women gather to make their discontent
      known. Among them are local WSPU groups from Yorkshire and Lancashire, a
      &#8216;clog and shawl brigade&#8217; of workers from cotton and worsted
      mills. The House of Commons is defended by more than 500 police.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Seventy-five women are arrested. The following day a photograph appears on
      the front page of the
      <strong
        >Daily Mirror<\/strong> of a young woman, flanked by a pair of police
        officers. Her skirts and shawl in disarray, her hair wild. She appears
        to be shouting. Her name is
        <strong
          >Dora Thewlis<\/strong>, a weaver in a Huddersfield mill. She is just
          sixteen years old.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a

            When she appears in front of the magistrate, one Mr Horace Smith, he
            is aghast:<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              The child cannot be a delegate or anything else. She doesn&#8217;t
              know what she&#8217;s doing. You ought to be at school. It is
              really a shocking thing that you should be brought up to London to
              be turned loose [\u2026]. Where is your
              Mother?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n
            </p>
            <p>Later:<\/p>\n</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                Here is a young girl of seventeen [in fact she is 16] enticed
                from her home in Yorkshire and let loose in the streets of
                London to come into collision with the police. It is disgraceful
                for everybody concerned.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                Like the prosecutor who, during the <a
                href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/books\/2010\/oct\/22\/dh-lawrence-lady-chatterley-trial\">Chatterley
                trial<\/a>, asked &#8220;Is it a book you would wish your wife
                or servants to read?&#8221;, Smith reveals by his indignation
                just how out of touch the establishment is with the lives of
                working people. Says Jill Liddington in her book <a
                href=\"http:\/\/www.jliddington.org.uk\/rebel-girls.html\"><strong
                  >Rebel Girls<\/strong><\/a>:<\/p>\n
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>
                      First, men like Horace Smith had not the remotest
                      understanding of child labour, let alone the half-time
                      system widespread in the north. His pontification is
                      tragically revealing about the dimensions of inequality.
                      Second, Smith saw &#8216;young girls&#8217; and
                      &#8216;London streets&#8217; as having only one possible
                      reading: moral looseness and semi-prostitution. The word
                      &#8216;entice&#8217; says it all: Dora had been
                      &#8216;enticed&#8217; down onto the London streets, in her
                      turn to &#8216;entice&#8217; innocent young men. [\u2026]
                      It remained unthinkable for respectable women to demand
                      citizenship by taking to the streets.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Dora Thewlis was borne of an environment hostile towards
                      working women; an environment that relied heavily upon the
                      textile industry, but one in which trade unionism was
                      heavily resisted by factory managers and owners and in
                      which the Yorkshire Warp Twisters had fought two
                      strikes,<br \ />\nsuccessfully, to prevent women entering
                      their profession. As an active member of the Independent
                      Labour Party (ILP), who (according to her mother) had
                      since the age of seven, &#8216;been a diligent reader of
                      the newspapers, [able to] hold her own in debate on
                      politics (Liddington, p 112), Thewlis was well aware of
                      the inequity of society.<\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      For the mill workers of Yorkshire and Lancashire, the
                      failures of capitalism were apparent in the hierarchies of
                      the factories. Mill workers were encouraged by their
                      physical environment to isolate themselves by specialism
                      so that ordinary labourers were looked down upon by
                      spinners and sorters, who in turn were sniffed at by the
                      overseers. This segregation, inevitably, extended outside
                      the factory walls, and for workers of different grades to
                      socialise together was unusual. Outside of large factories
                      small firms too held a paternalistic sway over the lives
                      of their workers, fighting constantly to keep down costs
                      and able to ruin the reputation of any worker that refused
                      to toe the line. The ILP sought a number of economic
                      reforms, summarised by Robert Haggard in <a
                      href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/Persistence-Victorian-Liberalism-1870-1900-Contributions\/dp\/0313313059\">this
                      book<\/a> as &#8220;an eight hour working day; the
                      abolition of overtime and piecework; the prohibition of
                      the employment of children; public provision for the sick,
                      the disabled, the aged, widows and orphans [and] free,
                      non-sectarian primary, secondary and university
                      education&#8221;, as well as a fair minimum wage. The
                      party was evangelical in its belief that the world could
                      be a better place for everyone through socialism.<\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Ardently supporting the ILP, it was not surprising that
                      Dora Thewlis would embrace suffrage with the same fervour,
                      and she joined the Huddersfield branch of the WSPU as a
                      founding member in December 1906.<\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      So it was that Thewlis found herself arrested and remanded
                      to Holloway. Once in prison, Thewlis was bathed, given a
                      prison number and uniform and separated from her comrades.
                      Inside the once belligerent, combative Thewlis grew lonely
                      and wan, convinced she had been forgotten. Though she
                      remained in Holloway only six days, Thelwis became a cause
                      c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. Christened the &#8216;Baby
                      Suffragette&#8217; by the
                      <strong
                        >Daily Mirror<\/strong>, she was dogged by reporters at
                        both ends of her journey back to Huddersfield.
                        Portentously, no members of the local WSPU came to meet
                        her.<\/p>\n
                        <p>
                          Following her return home Thewlis regained a little of
                          her spirit. &#8220;Don&#8217;t call me the &#8216;Baby
                          Suffragette'&#8221;, she told one reporter, &#8220;I
                          am not a baby really. In May next year I shall be
                          eighteen years of age. Surely for a girl that is a
                          good age?&#8221;. The sobriquet belittled Thewlis,
                          just as Horace<br \ />\nSmith had, opening her up to
                          ridicule both in the press and from her fellow
                          suffragists. There was a feeling of alienation among
                          the Huddersfield suffragists who felt attention had
                          been drawn away from their cause by disputes over
                          Thewlis&#8217; age and Mr Smith&#8217;s comments about
                          &#8220;enticement&#8221;.<\/p>\n
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          By August of 1907 the image of young Thewlis being
                          arrested had been turned into a picture postcard, and,
                          though Dora herself had remained largely quiet on the
                          matter, relations between the Thewlis women and the
                          WSPU had become strained. It&#8217;s difficult to know
                          exactly what caused the tension, though Dora&#8217;s
                          mother Eliza, who tended to claim a greater role than
                          she ought in the branch dealings, undoubtedly did not
                          help the situation. A letter was dispatched to the
                          Thewlis home asking Eliza Thewlis to work agreeably or
                          resign from the branch.<\/p>\n
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          All Thewlis and her cohorts wanted was to be granted
                          the right to vote. The had to abide by the law of the
                          land, they argued, so why could they not have a hand
                          in creating it? It is worth noting that, despite the
                          WSPU&#8217;s significant working class membership,
                          they did not fight for universal suffrage, but the
                          right for women to vote on the same terms as men. It
                          was, in the words of one nameless critic, &#8220;not
                          votes for women, but votes for ladies&#8221;; only a
                          meagre few would meet the property qualification
                          required by law. Dora Thewlis, with her socialist zeal
                          and youthful indignation, would not be one of those
                          women.<\/p>\n
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The WSPU, with their motto of &#8220;Deeds Not
                          Words&#8221; was founded in 1903, in the wake of
                          perceived inertia in the National Union of
                          Women&#8217;s Suffrage Societies (NUWSS). They became
                          increasingly militant, with a policy of breaking the
                          windows of government buildings introduced in 1908,
                          with<br \ />\nthe first hunger strikes taking place
                          the following year. In 1912 they began attacking the
                          contents of post boxes, and the campaign of violence
                          and arson escalated. The following year Emily Davison
                          <a
                          href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/2011\/03\/30\/deeds-not-words-emily-wilding-davison\/\">became
                          a martyr to the cause<\/a>, dying following head
                          injuries sustained in what is likely to have been an
                          attempt to grab the bridle of the King&#8217;s horse
                          at the Derby.<\/p>\n
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          It is frequently argued that such militancy did more
                          to harm the suffragist cause than to progress it, and
                          that the constitutional actions of Millicent
                          Fawcett&#8217;s NUWSS and the Women&#8217;s Freedom
                          League did more to earn the enfranchisement of
                          Women.<\/p>\n
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The Qualification of Women Act was passed in 1918,
                          allowing female householders (or wives of
                          householders), women with an annual household rent of
                          at least \u00a35, and female graduates of British
                          universities to vote if they were over the age of 30.
                          Thewlis, who had emigrated to Australia (where women
