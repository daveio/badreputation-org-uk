        href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/world\/2010\/nov\/01\/dilma-rousseff-wins-brazil-president\">Brazil
        got a female President<\/a>. And she said things like this:<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          &#8220;I would like for fathers and mothers to look into their
          daughters&#8217; eyes today and tell them: &#8216;Yes, women
          can.&#8217; I would like to register my first post-election
          commitment: to honour Brazilian women so that this unprecedented fact
          becomes a natural event.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          We in the UK have not had the best role models when it comes to female
          politicians. They&#8217;ve tended to be massively conservative (even
          when in the Labour party). There was Margaret Thatcher, who was
          certainly female and Prime Minister. Feminists seem to be split on
          whether that fact alone makes her an icon, or whether the illiberal
          policies her Conservative party enacted set us back decades. I
          won&#8217;t argue that here.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          Since then we&#8217;ve had some really appalling female politicians.
          In 2004, Ruth Kelly became the youngest woman to ever sit in the
          Cabinet as the &#8216;Secretary of State for Education and
          Skills&#8217;. Unfortunately, the National Union of Teachers gave her
          an F. She then became both &#8216;Secretary of State for Communities
          and Local Government&#8217; and &#8216;Minister for Women and
          Equality&#8217;. These posts included being the government&#8217;s
          liason to the Muslim community, which was an odd choice for a woman
          who belonged to the ultra-strict Catholic sect called
          <em
            >Opus Dei<\/em>. It also involved fighting for equality for women,
            which was an odd choice for&#8230; you get the idea. (Opus
            Dei&#8217;s <a
            href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Women_in_Opus_Dei\">record
            on women&#8217;s rights<\/a> wasn&#8217;t exactly spectacular, even
            before you get to <a
            href=\"http:\/\/onfaith.washingtonpost.com\/onfaith\/\/2010\/11\/vote_your_values\/all.html\">questions
            on abortion or contraception<\/a>.)<\/p>\n
            <p>
              Jacqui Smith did a much better job with Education, but then became
              one of the most hardline Home Secretaries we&#8217;ve ever seen,
              introducing all kinds of laws which removed civil liberties and
              sparked protests &#8211; ID cards, email snooping, holding without
              charge, tougher laws on drugs and prostitution (against official
              scientists&#8217; and social advisers&#8217; advice) that did
              nothing to solve the problems, etc.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              Harriet Harman is held as a hero by some, although she&#8217;s not
              without her share of conservative or illiberal voting either. She
              proposed a rule change to hide MP&#8217;s expenses from the
              public, voted for the war, and nearly always kept in line with
              whatever the government position on anything was. (You can&#8217;t
              do this and be very liberal, at least not in the UK in the past 30
              years).<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>Hazel Blears&#8230; next.<\/p>\n</p>
            <p>
              Without going down the full list, the trend has definitely been
              that while we&#8217;ve had women in positions of power (Deputy
              leader of the Labour Party, senior posts) there haven&#8217;t been
              any big shining examples of female politicians bringing about
              social equality.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              In the US we have such amazing liberal heroines as Hillary Clinton
              (my personal opinion here, but I reckon we&#8217;d have invaded
              Iran already if she was in) and the now-famous
              &#8216;feminist&#8217; Sarah&#8230; Palin&#8230; *hides*<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              Which is why Dilma Rousseff saying these things as the new
              President of Brazil is so brilliant.
              <em
                >&#8220;Equal opportunities for men and women are an essential
                principle of democracy.&#8221;<\/em> That&#8217;s fantastic. The
                UK Labour party is meant to be about reducing inequality, and
                the Lib Dems have it written specifically on their membership
                cards, but so far their records when they get into power have
                been of massively increasing inequality (especially
                financial).<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_852\" style=\"width:

                <p>
                  There is a lot of scrutiny on the numbers of women in
                  political positions, but I think higher numbers become less
                  important if they&#8217;re just as aggressive, reactionary and
                  conservative as the men. What we need as feminists is someone
                  who will move forward not back, move away from the traditional
                  and do new things, and put the support in place to enable
                  women to have a clear chance at equality. In my opinion, that
                  person would by definition have to be a liberal, not
                  conservative. And probably a lefty one.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  It&#8217;s a sad fact that when they hear the words
                  &#8220;Madam President&#8221;, a lot of people immediately
                  think of Battlestar Galactica. Laura Roslin might have been
                  forced to become extremely ruthless due to the plot of the
                  show, but she started off as a bleeding-heart liberal &#8211;
                  and we don&#8217;t have many of those to choose from. More
                  often, women in power have to prove themselves as more
                  traditionally masculine than the men just to not be considered
                  &#8216;weak&#8217;.<\/p>\n

                <p>
                  President Rousseff seems to be ready to take on anything her
                  political enemies can throw at her (which will likely be a
                  lot, given the dirty media campaign against her in the
                  election) but she has come out with the absolutely clear
                  message that equality is a priority. BadRep wishes her every
                  success in her new post!<\/p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy
