                                    It&#8217;s important to remember that the
                                    game and the film encounter Selina\/Catwoman
                                    at different points in her story and her
                                    relationship with Bruce\/the Bat.\u00a0
                                    Despite this, both mediums do quite well in
                                    demonstrating her motivations and
                                    character.\u00a0 The film, however, does
                                    marginally better as it manages to do this
                                    while advancing, generally, a bit more
                                    respectful portrayal of her as a
