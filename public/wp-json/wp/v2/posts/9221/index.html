<p>
  &#8216;Men aren&#8217;t attentive to girls who wear glasses&#8217; is Marilyn
  Monroe&#8217;s sober pronouncement at the end of 1953&#8217;s classic
  <strong
    >How to Marry a Millionaire<\/strong>. As the myopic Pola, she&#8217;s spent
    the whole of the film whipping off her glasses as soon as she gets a whiff
    of aftershave.<\/p>\n
    <p>
      &#8216;Honestly Pola, why can&#8217;t you keep those cheaters on long
      enough to see who you&#8217;re with?&#8217; asks exasperated gal pal
      Lauren Bacall, to which Pola replies:<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8216;Oh no, I&#8217;m not taking a chance like that! You know what they
      say about girls who wear glasses.&#8217;<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Apparently &#8211; according to a <a
      href=\"http:\/\/www.selectspecs.com\/blog\/the-sexy-librarian-look\/\">single
      and slightly biased internet source<\/a>\u00a0&#8211; this wasn&#8217;t a
      million miles away from Monroe herself, who was &#8216;nearsighted and
      often wore glasses at times when she was out of the limelight&#8217;. If
      we believe this Fun Fact, its absence from the public domain underscores
      the irony. You know what they say about girls who wear glasses.<\/p>\n

        I&#8217;ve got a lot of sympathy for poor Pola-Marilyn.\u00a0I\u2019ve
        had moderate to severe myopia since primary school, and spent a large
        portion of my teenage years bumping into things and hugging strangers
        out of a misguided desire to be considered attractive by the Average
        Teenage Boy.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_9587\" style=\"width: 533px\"

        To bring the sob story towards a conclusion: I got contact lenses for my
        sixteenth birthday, wore them every hour of consciousness (to the
        long-term detriment of my ocular health), got a few erosions, corneal
        scars and whatnot due to excessive wear, finally accepted I needed a
        good pair of glasses and recently found the pair of frames I like with
        the help of a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.spexinthecity.com\/\">critical and
        dedicated sales assistant and a significant wad of cash<\/a>. I
        objectively like my glasses nowadays. But I still don&#8217;t wear them
        if I can help it.<\/p>\n

        Eyes Wide Shut<\/h3>\n
        <p>
          I have a literary precursor as far back as George Eliot, whose
          short-sighted Dorothea Brooke misses part of the plot of\u00a0<strong
            >Middlemarch<\/strong>, by being \u2018aware that there was a
            gentleman standing at a distance, but see[ing] him merely as a
            coated figure at a wide angle\u2019. For Dorothea, the sights of
            Rome on her honeymoon are like &#8216;a disease of the
            retina&#8217;. <a

              Indeed, you certainly don&#8217;t see many glasses on women
              pre-1950 or thereabouts, although they&#8217;ve <a

                        These last are very much about glasses as a cover-up for

                          and blood!&#8217;. In much the same way, any
                          unattractive high school social outcast has but to
                          throw off their frames to reveal a <a

                            Of course, the popularity of pre-makeover glasses
                            &#8211; and their enduring use in teen films &#8211;
                            is partly practical. Glasses are the easiest way to
                            disguise a Hollywood beauty, and an instantly

                            that go on to dog you, to a greater or lesser
                            extent, for a large part of your adult life. As a
                            girl growing up behind a pair of glasses, and
                            steeped in the standard adolescent amount of
                            ideological nonsense, you cannot but associate all
                            that tedious baggage (&#8216;I&#8217;m unattractive!

                            the teenage glasses, and shedding it with embracing

                            slightly obnoxious) appropriation of these

                                      here that a man with glasses becomes less
                                      frightening or powerful, less brashly
