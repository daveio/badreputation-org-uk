<p>
  So, the first episode of HBO\u2019s
  <strong
    >Game of Thrones<\/strong>, adapted from the popular
    <strong
      >George R R Martin<\/strong> books (a series of gritty low-fantasy books
      about the battle for control of a kingdom and the threat of wintery Others
      from the North), has now aired. How is it? We\u2019ll get to that in a
      moment.<\/p>\n
      <p>
        What\u2019s been almost more interesting than the content of the show
        itself has been the response from critics. Ginia Bellafante kicked
        things off in the <a
        href=\"http:\/\/tv.nytimes.com\/2011\/04\/15\/arts\/television\/game-of-thrones-begins-sunday-on-hbo-review.html\"><strong
          >New York Times<\/strong><\/a>, labelling the show as
          \u201cboy-fiction\u201d, and suggesting that the standard HBO sex has
          been thrown in to appeal to otherwise disinterested female viewers.
          Because obviously boys like swords and fighting and girls like sex and
          drama. That\u2019s how gender works, right? Wait, no.<\/p>\n
          <p>
            Annalee Newitz at <a
            href=\"http:\/\/uk.io9.com\/5792574\/really-why-would-men-ever-want-to-watch-game-of-thrones\"><strong
              >io9<\/strong><\/a> argues back, but instead of dismissing the
              whole notion of gender essentialism and stories that are
              \u201cfor\u201d one gender or another Newitz takes it the other
              way, arguing that this is clearly a tale for women. Oh, wait,
              perhaps it\u2019s a satirical exaggeration of the idea, to
              highlight the ridiculousness of Bellafante\u2019s review. Well,
              hopefully it is. It still doesn\u2019t get around the issue of
              thinking people of any particular gender are wired to want certain
              things from their fiction, though.<\/p>\n
              <p>
                Ilana Teitalbaum weighs in with a more straightforward critique
                of the ways in which Bellafante\u2019s review is terribly
                misguided over at the <a
                href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/ilana-teitelbaum\/game-of-thrones-hbo_b_850014.html\"><strong
                  >Huffington Post<\/strong><\/a>, and probably provides the
                  most sensible view on the discussion. I\u2019m going to quote
                  her here, because what she says is worth repeating for anyone
                  too lazy to click through the links.<\/p>\n
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>
                      The characterization of fantasy as &#8220;boy
                      fiction&#8221; is offensive to the genre and offensive to
                      women. That we for the most part will only read what Oprah
                      has picked, and especially if a woman wrote it, is a
                      stereotype that is not only demeaning to women &#8212; it
                      is also untrue\u2026<\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      \u2026When we categorize books as &#8220;boy
                      fiction&#8221; and &#8220;girl fiction&#8221; it&#8217;s
                      just another way to promote gender stereotyping. It is
                      predicated on the assumption that people will only read
                      books that reflect their personal experiences, so
                      therefore women will only deign to read about dating,
                      shopping, and kitchen intrigues.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n

                    <p>
                      Okay, with that said, on to the show itself. Trying to
                      avoid spoilers here, but apologies if any slip through. As
                      an adaptation, it&#8217;s generally pretty damn solid.
                      There are the inevitable minor changes that come with
                      translating a work to screen, but there are none of the
                      glaring alterations that make you stand up and go
                      \u201cThey did what? But that\u2019s totally out of
                      character! Did they even read the books?\u201d The casting
                      is good (<strong
                        >Harry Lloyd<\/strong> as Viserys Targaryen is palpably
                        creepy and unpleasant), the costumes are well done, and
                        Arya Stark and Tyrion Lannister already shine as the
                        best characters. Arya Stark gets painfully little screen
                        time though, which leads to the first issue with the
                        show.<\/p>\n<div style=\"width: 314px\"

                          The female characters, as of the first episode, do not
                          get much representation. Hopefully this is a temporary
                          thing and, like the books, we\u2019ll get to see Arya,
                          Danaerys, Catelyn etc grow into being hugely important
                          badasses that sit firmly at the centre of key plot
                          points. But right now they\u2019re just not there.
                          They get scarcely any screen time, and when they are
                          shown they\u2019re mostly cast in passive, receptive
                          roles. Tyrion Lannister (<strong

                            (because it\u2019s not a HBO show without frequent
                            sex and nudity) who gets more lines than Cersei
                            Lannister and Arya Stark put together.<\/p>\n
                            <p>
                              And Danaerys\u2026 Okay, this falls on the book as
                              much as the adaptation, and it\u2019s hard to see
                              a way they could have worked around it, but her
                              initial role as a tool for her brother\u2019s
                              plans, without any say in her own life, feels very
                              awkward. Two scenes in particular are awkward
                              enough to be uncomfortable to watch. First
                              there\u2019s the close up of a nude Danaerys
                              (<strong
                                >Emilia Clarke<\/strong>) being examined by her
                                brother (and bear in mind this is a character
                                written as being just thirteen in the book,
                                though thankfully HBO seem to have aged her up a
                                bit), to make sure she\u2019s up to scratch for
                                bartering away in exchange for an army, with
                                oddly lingering shots of nipples and buttocks.
                                This scene, which really should convey
                                &#8220;look how bloody nasty and unpleasant
                                Viserys is,&#8221; instead comes off more as
                                &#8220;and here are some breasts, do you like
                                them?&#8221;<\/p>\n
                                <p>
                                  And then we have the consummation of the
                                  marriage to the head of said army, Khal Drogo
                                  of the Dothraki, a scene that is shown to be
                                  even more upsetting and non-consensual than it
                                  was originally written. And it was pretty damn
                                  bad to start with. The scene is at least
                                  short, and cuts away before anything graphic,
                                  but it does raise the question of why someone
                                  at HBO thought \u201cHmm, what this scene
                                  needs is to be made a bit more rapey.\u201d
                                  Seriously, there is pretty much never a time
                                  when this is a good thing for a piece of
                                  fiction. Ever.<\/p>\n
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  Still, as said, there is hope that the
                                  characters will develop along the same lines
                                  they did in the book, so this issue might be a
                                  passing one. The second problem, though, is
                                  less likely to improve with future
                                  episodes.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_5071\"

                                  The second issue, you see, is the unfortunate
                                  race failure. You could argue that it\u2019s
                                  just being faithful to the books, but honestly
                                  that\u2019s not much of an excuse. Everyone is
                                  oh so very white, and everyone we\u2019re told
                                  is attractive (Cersei, Jaime, Danaerys) is oh
                                  so very blonde to boot. The closest we get to
                                  non-white characters are the slightly-tanned
                                  Dothraki horsemen with whom Viserys is trying

                                  they\u2019re depicted as crude savages. And I

                                  over a woman, one literally pushing the other
                                  away mid-thrust and hopping on himself (which
                                  is a whole other pile of issues), before
                                  blades are drawn and someone gets
                                  disembowelled. True to the books it may be,
