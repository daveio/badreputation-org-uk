          <p>Hi there, internet! This is a feminist blog-<\/p>\n</p>

            Quit gurning at the back already. EYES FRONT, PEOPLE. Just for a

            Feminism has a bad old rep at the moment. My search results for the
            word, as I write this, are a predictable molotov of very established
            feminist sites and an obligatory dollop of &#8220;this stuff
            destroys homes&#8221;-type bile.\u00a0 So far, so expected.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            But increasingly, there&#8217;s a lot of mainstream cringing about
            the f-word going on, with words like &#8220;irrelevant&#8221;,
            &#8220;exclusive&#8221; and &#8220;outdated&#8221; on constant
            rotation.\u00a0 Call yourself a feminist in conversation, and you
            will very likely be handed the Invisible Awkward Balloon.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            You know what I&#8217;m talking about.\u00a0 Suddenly
            everyone&#8217;s looking at you funny. They&#8217;ve decided
            you&#8217;re &#8220;a bit quirky&#8221;. You have to hold the
            Awkward Balloon for the rest of the conversation. No matter what you
            do, it will not just float away. You think, &#8220;Ack. I am
            <em
              >so<\/em> not mentioning this aspect of my socio-political views
              out loud ever again&#8221;.\u00a0 Sad times, people.<\/p>\n<p

                    For us, putting it simply, feminism is the recognition that
                    in many areas both close to home and internationally, women
                    and men do not receive equal rights and privileges.\u00a0 It
                    goes further than that, too &#8211; it&#8217;s the stance of
                    owning the opinion that this should change for the better,
                    and
                    <em
                      >not<\/em> in a way in which one gender supercedes
                      another, whatever the &#8220;fem&#8221; bit at the
                      beginning might imply. A great deal of progress has been
                      made with this in many countries, but the fact remains
                      that attitudes change slowly, even after legislation has
                      been passed.<\/p>\n

                        <p>
                          There are a lot of people out there who would support
                          the above stance.\u00a0 But they&#8217;re wary of
                          using the dreaded f-word, or of connecting with people
                          who use it.\u00a0 Some of them, however it happened
                          &#8211; and we&#8217;re not bothered about blaming
                          anybody &#8211;\u00a0 seem to have ended up feeling
                          that their activism might not be welcome if they did
                          either of these things.\u00a0 We think this is a
                          shame.<\/p>\n

                            through feminism, though we have it in common as a
                            label we agree works well. This blog is our shared
                            platform &#8211; and we don&#8217;t always agree
                            with each other, either. Sometimes we&#8217;re
