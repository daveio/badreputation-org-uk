  Over the past year, a lot of my spare time has been spent researching and
  writing on women in post-punk for Julia Downes&#8217; new history of the girl
  band, <a

      A surprisingly difficult part of this was establishing what we talk about
      when we talk about post-punk. Roughly, the term refers to the wave of
      musical experimentation which took place in the wake of punk from the late
      1970s to the mid-1980s. It was informed conceptually by the art-school
      background and grounding in political and cultural theory of many of its
      members, and distinguished by musical, vocal and lyrical experimentation
      and by a frequently self-conscious and self-critical approach to the idea
      of being in a band and making music. All of which meant that it sounded,
      to varying degrees, original, arresting, and odd.<\/p>\n

    <p>
      Post-punk\u2019s disorderly, subversive and category-resistant nature has
      seen it marginalised in accounts of its era, although the past few years
      have produced a handful of <a
      href=\"http:\/\/ripitupinfohype.blogspot.co.uk\/2007\/08\/info-on-rip-it-up-and-start-again.html\">useful
      retrospectives<\/a>, as well as the early-2000s <a
      href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Post-punk_revival\">revival<\/a>
      of post-punk musical techniques which, if you still can\u2019t explain
      what it is, at least make it easier to explain what it sounds like.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      For me, a large part of the significance of post-punk was that it seemed
      to involve an unprecedented amount of women as artists, fans, and critics.
      Its musical, political and aesthetic influence can be traced in many
      subsequent female-friendly movements, including twee, riot grrrl, grunge
      and electro. Some post-punk women \u2013 <a

    </p>
    <p>
      Extending the gains of punk\u2019s emphasis on DIY culture, accessibility
      and amateurism, post-punk women were able to take their bands in
      experimental directions, producing lyrics which explored the female
      experience in startlingly innovative ways, and music which itself took on
      what Slits bassist Tessa Pollitt described, when I interviewed her for the
      book, as a \u2018new, raw, and female\u2019 form, a self-consciously
      radical sound dealing with rarely-expressed emotions like embarrassment,
      awkwardness and anxiety.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      In terms of subject matter, post-punk\u2019s ideological concern with the
      politicisation of the personal, and with identifying and promoting
      authenticity in the face of popular cultural stereotypes, lent itself to
      exploration from a feminine and feminist angle. This concern with
      authenticity was expressed in the songs themselves, which were produced,
      structured and presented in a way which set them apart from the glossy
      manufactured products of mainstream artists. It was expressed too in
      lyrics which demystified and deconstructed conventional femininity, love,
      sex and romance, and which analysed social and cultural pressures on women
      or the tensions of personal relationships in implicitly political
      ways.<\/p>\n

              ESG, from South Bronx, based their pioneering sound on a love of
              James Brown, Motown and disco. Spotted at a talent contest, they
              began to play New York\u2019s cutting-edge clubs, where their
              sound dovetailed neatly, if unexpectedly, with that of the No Wave
