    >Sucker Punch<\/strong><\/a>, had a magnificent trailer. It really stoked
    me. I was all, &#8220;Hey, this trailer is awesome! I must avail my face of
    the cinematographical delight it advertises!&#8221; And then I saw it and it
    was crap.<\/p>\n
    <p>
      <strong
        >Source Code<\/strong>, starring my favourite<strong>
          Jake Gyllenhaal<\/strong> and directed by David Bowie&#8217;s son,
          <strong
            >Duncan Jones<\/strong>, was the total opposite. I saw the trailer
            and scattered my scornflakes to the four winds. &#8220;Pssh and
            foo,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Gorgeous, creepy premise and it&#8217;s
            all about SAVE THE LADY, WOOO, TOTALLY UNFEASIBLE ROMANTIC
            RELATIONSHIP IS THE CRUX OF ALL ACTION.&#8221; I guffawed and rolled
            my eyes. &#8220;How
            <em
              >boring<\/em>. How
              <em
                >stupid<\/em>. How anachronistically
                <em
                  >unfeminist<\/em>, to have the woman as a passive thing that
                  needs rescuing.&#8221;<\/p>\n
                  <p>
                    But I went to see it anyway, because my passion for Jake
                    Gyllenhaal&#8217;s beautiful face is unrivalled and
                    disturbing. And also because Duncan Jones&#8217;s breakout
                    film,
                    <strong
                      >Moon<\/strong>, was widely touted as a dreadfully
                      disturbing psychological affair, and I still rue the fact
                      that I missed it at the cinema &#8211; so maybe it would
                      have my proverbial cookies after all?<\/p>\n
                      <p>Short answer: yes.<\/p>\n</p>
                      <p>
                        Long answer: yeeeesssss, mmm, yes, mmm, thank you,
                        Duncan, mmmm, Jake Gyllenhaal, hargleblarge he handcuffs
                        a man to a pole, nrrgghhnnffnnff nargb.<\/p>\n
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Long intelligible answer: It certainly does. It turns
                        out that the film&#8217;s content is the complete
                        opposite of what the trailer would have me believe. The
                        trailer bigs up the romantic relationship and downplays
                        the unsettling premise. The film, on the other hand, is
                        all about the premise, which rules the shop from start
                        to finish, throwing up questions of morality and ethics
                        in science, what happens to the universe when we make
                        decisions, and the nature of a good death. The romance
                        is a barely-there breath of something sweet and touching
                        that&#8217;s symptomatic of the premise rather than an
                        event all in itself.<\/p>\n
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I keep talking about this magical wonderpremise like
                        it&#8217;s Jesus and I haven&#8217;t even explained what
                        it is. How rude of me. Let&#8217;s fix that.<\/p>\n
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The premise, without spoiling anything, is that there is
                        some military science (SCIENCE! more like) that allows a
                        person to take possession of a dead person&#8217;s final
                        memories, ten minutes before their death. This involves,
                        of course, a poor bastard (in this case, a
                        harassed-looking, sweaty Jake Gyllenhaal) being held
                        prisoner in a Science Tank and forced back into some
                        dead guy&#8217;s brain so that he can solve terrorism
                        forever. In this case, Jake Gyllenhaal scuba dives
                        through time and space into ten minutes prior to a
                        big-ass explosion that detonates an entire train on the
                        way to Chicago.<\/p>\n
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        In the process of this, Jake Gyllenhaal observes the
                        bloody, violent reality of the terrorist attack, and
                        experiences first-hand the nature of the death the train
                        passengers had foisted upon them out of the blue. This
                        raises two issues: firstly, the morality of the military
                        experiment that forces a man to repeatedly experience
                        death from which he cannot escape. Secondly, we realise,
                        along with Jake&#8217;s captive captain, that death
                        without closure is worse than death itself.<\/p>\n
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        So the reason, then, that there&#8217;s this romantic
                        subplot
                        <em
                          >anything<\/em>, is less about OH ROMANCE, SAVE THE

                          &#8211; and her fellow passengers &#8211; a chance to
                          have a good death.<\/p>\n
                          <p>
                            Wow, that was one hell of a paragraph. What
                            I&#8217;m saying is that
                            <strong
                              >Source Code<\/strong> doesn&#8217;t buy into the
                              &#8220;Fuck everything, save the chick!&#8221;
                              spiel wholesale. It touches upon it, but
                              it&#8217;s made emphatically clear through events
                              in the film that it&#8217;s not really about that
                              at all. And good job too, because we all know that
                              that kind of carrying-on is insulting to everyone
                              involved.<\/p>\n
                              <p>
                                Another thing: although this film deals heavily
                                with military science &#8211; a combination of
                                fields that stereotypically leaves women out
                                wholesale &#8211; one of the lynchpin characters
                                is a woman, and she&#8217;s not only steely and
                                full of agency and poise, but she carries a
                                bucketload of morality and cunning, too. I loved
                                her. I was very glad she was in it to balance
                                out the do-stuff-and-explode machismo of Jake
                                Gyllenhaal Fighting Science.<\/p>\n
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                That said, he fights science very well, and when
                                we&#8217;re dumped right into the thick of it
                                along with Mr Gyllenhaal&#8217;s beleaguered
                                captain with as much explanation as he gets
                                (that is to say, none whatsoever) the tension is
                                wound so tight that it&#8217;s painful.
                                It&#8217;s frightening and paranoia-inducing,
                                and flavoured with a little pinch of<strong>
                                  Groundhog Day<\/strong>.<\/p>\n
                                  <p>
                                    Overall, yeah!

                                      he&#8217;s in a suit and he&#8217;s doing
