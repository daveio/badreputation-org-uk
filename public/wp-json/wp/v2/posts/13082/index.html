        <p>
          In February 2010, Hannah Forman (under the pen name Hannah Neurotica)
          began <a href=\"http:\/\/www.womeninhorrormonth.com\/\"><strong
            >Women in Horror Recognition Month<\/strong><\/a> as a way to
            celebrate women&#8217;s contribution to the horror industry.<\/p>\n
            <p>
              She began the campaign out of frustration at the lack of coverage
              of women working in horror media, and received a terrific response
              to the initiative. People used social media and blogging platforms
              to discuss their favourite women creators throughout the month of
              February, and aided the conversation about horror and
              women&#8217;s participation in it. It&#8217;s a fine example of
              how online communities can be harnessed to a positive effect.
              It&#8217;s become an annual event since then.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              In the past four years there&#8217;s been a discernable increase
              of attention given to women&#8217;s contributions across the
              creative spectrum. This has not been given freely. It&#8217;s come
              about because women and men have asked to see a more equal
              representation of work by creators they enjoy. It&#8217;s because
              of campaigns liked Women in Horror Recognition Month that some
              media sources have finally noticed there
              <em
                >are<\/em> women in the industry, and that many of them have
                been around for a long time.<\/p>\n
                <p>
                  Hopefully there will come a time when such an initiative is
                  redundant, but since the <a
                  href=\"http:\/\/www.vidaweb.org\/the-2011-count\">Vida
                  statistics<\/a> on the participation and coverage of
                  women&#8217;s work in many media sources remains low, that
                  time is not upon us yet.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  Two years ago, Bad Reputation asked me to write an article
                  called <a

                    and this year I&#8217;m singling out the work of women who
                    create across horror media.<\/p>\n

                        stories began to be published, from 2005 onwards. Her

                        unashamedly erotic in a way that honestly reflects the
