<p>
  Having had a thorough sulk at P.D. James <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/2012\/08\/15\/get-off-pemberleys-lawn-jane-austen-and-p-d-james-part-i\/\">in
  the previous article<\/a>, and explained why I didn\u2019t approach
  <strong
    >Death Comes To Pemberley<\/strong> with entirely charitable feelings,
    I\u2019d like to turn to the novel itself. This second article may sound as
    if I\u2019m treating James\u2019 novel as a reading of
    <strong
      >Pride and Prejudice<\/strong> (or at least \u201cAustenworld\u201d)
      rather than a novel in its own right. If so, that\u2019s because
      <strong
        >Death Comes To Pemberley<\/strong> goes out of its way to insist on the
        connections between itself and the previous work, and the way it claims
        to develop the characters. So the first twelve pages are taken up with a
        Prologue entitled \u201cThe Bennets of Longbourn\u201d in which we get
        to wallow comfortably in the aftermath of
        <strong
          >Pride and Prejudice<\/strong>. It turns out Mary gets married, Mr.
          Bennet spends a lot of his time in his son-in-law\u2019s library at
          Pemberley, and Mrs. Bennet prefers to spend time boasting to her
          friends about Pemberley\u2019s grandeur instead of enjoying its
          hospitality.<\/p>\n
          <p>
            There are some shrewd bits of character work here, but it\u2019s
            largely working over the plot of the previous novel, and projecting
            how the new living arrangements will work out. I kept remembering
            the passage in Donna Tartt&#8217;s
            <strong
              >The Secret History<\/strong> where Richard, away at a party at a
              friend\u2019s country house, indulges a fantasy:<\/p>\n
              <blockquote>

                  of living there, of not having to go back ever to asphalt and
                  shopping malls and modular furniture; of living there with
                  Charles and Camilla and Henry and Francis and maybe even
                  Bunny; of no one marrying or going home or getting a job in a
                  town a thousand miles away or doing any of the traitorous
                  things friends do after college; of everything remaining
                  exactly as it was, that instant&#8230;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n

                  out. (If you don\u2019t, <a

                  that book a read<\/a>. Terrific fun.) All the arrangements
                  seem to slot together rather too well, particularly given the
                  conversation in Chapter 32 of
                  <strong
                    >P&amp;P<\/strong> about how a woman may be \u201csettled

                    Elizabeth\u2019s longing for her own independent life and
                    guilt over whether that involves being ashamed of her
                    family. I think the phrase \u201cfifty miles of good
                    road\u201d is splendidly ambiguous (and recently discovered
                    it\u2019s the name of <a

                    fanfiction community<\/a>.)<\/p>\n
                    <p>
                      The first twelve pages feel like a fantasia on Elizabeth
                      and Darcy\u2019s engagement, a calculation of how
                      everything will be alright now that\u2019s settled, and
                      criticisms aside, that immediately locates the book.
                      We\u2019re encouraged to see it as a working out of
                      stories and characters which were present in
                      <strong
                        >Pride and Prejudice<\/strong>. There are different ways
                        a novel can derive from, respond to or somehow continue
                        an earlier work, and
                        <strong
                          >Death Comes To Pemberley<\/strong> makes it fairly
                          clear that this is will be a close engagement with its
                          primogenitor. Story continues directly onwards: same
                          main character, similar point of view and locations
                          we\u2019ve seen to a certain extent. That sounds a
                          rather mechanical checklist, but since the novel is in
                          a (partially) different genre it\u2019s worth
                          stressing the extent to which it doesn\u2019t
                          advertise a radical departure from the setting and
                          mode of
                          <strong
                            >Pride and Prejudice<\/strong>.<\/p>\n

                              Unfortunately, this means that it has a tendency
                              to the line I identified in my previous post, of
                              pointing out important things which Austen missed
                              out. Since
                              <strong
                                >Death<\/strong> begins so closely to
                                <strong
                                  >Pride<\/strong>, when it diverges it feels
                                  like a conscious addition to the first
                                  novel\u2019s vision of the world. Servants
                                  make their appearance as fuller characters,
                                  Wollstonecraft is name-checked, and we are
                                  made more aware of a Wider World. It
                                  wouldn\u2019t be fair to dismiss the whole
                                  book on this basis, and it contains a lot of
                                  very enjoyable writing and deft plotting, but
                                  there are some deeply surprising moments from
                                  an author who apparently respects Austen as
                                  much as James does.<\/p>\n

                                    For example, Elizabeth sits listening to the
                                    wind in Pemberley\u2019s chimneys, and is
                                    hounded by<\/p>\n

                                      before. She thought \u2018Here we sit at
                                      the beginning of a new century, citizens
                                      of the most civilized country in Europe,
                                      surrounded by the splendour of its
                                      craftsmanship, its art and the books which
                                      enshrine its literature, while outside
                                      there is another world which wealth and
                                      education and privilege can keep from us,
                                      a world in which men are as violent and
                                      destructive as is the animal world.
                                      Perhaps even the most fortunate of us will
                                      not be able to ignore it and keep it at

                                      It\u2019s unclear in the context whether
                                      this is a reflection on the French
                                      Revolution, social class or simply
                                      Elizabeth \u201cgrowing up\u201d, but it
                                      rather takes me aback to be told that she
                                      had never realised that there was an
                                      unfriendly rapacious world out there. A
                                      significant part of Austen&#8217;s
                                      original novel (as well as other of her
                                      works such as
                                      <strong
                                        >Sense and Sensibility<\/strong>)
                                        expends an awful lot of time making it
                                        clear that social conventions damn women
                                        both ways: determining many of their
                                        life choices and opportunities if they
                                        stay within the limits, and marking them
                                        as \u201cfair game\u201d if they step
                                        beyond them. Admittedly Austen\u2019s
                                        characters are all of a certain class,
                                        but a lot of them are almost obsessively
                                        aware of the importance of
                                        \u201crespectability\u201d. I don\u2019t
                                        think it\u2019s unreasonable to think
                                        that this awareness doesn\u2019t stem
                                        entirely from docile acceptance of the
                                        need to be a \u201cgood girl\u201d, and
                                        that it involves a strong, if vague,
                                        conception of the exploitation and
                                        violence which lies beyond that
                                        category.<\/p>\n
                                        <p>
                                          \u201cRuin\u201d isn\u2019t a
                                          pearl-clutching abstraction for Austen
                                          heroines. I mention this because her
                                          work is so often dismissed from
                                          serious consideration by either
                                          enthusiasts who want to claim her as a
                                          dating expert, or detractors who see
                                          her as a silly woman sheltered from
                                          the real world. This isn\u2019t an
                                          abstract point of how we frame
                                          particular historical texts, it\u2019s
                                          having consequences right now.

                                          brush off the idea that reading Austen

                                                You discuss what Miss Darcy
                                                should do as if she were a
                                                child. We have entered the
                                                nineteenth century; we do not
                                                need to be a disciple of Mrs
                                                Wollstonecraft to feel that
                                                women should not be denied a
                                                voice in matters that concern
                                                them. It is some centuries since
                                                we accepted that a woman has a
                                                soul. Is it not time that we
                                                accepted she also has a

                                                This is so startlingly
                                                shoehorned in that I was almost
                                                tempted to class it as a joke.
                                                The Wollstobomb is so
                                                enthusiastically dropped that I
                                                assumed it was either a
                                                deliberate frivolity or James
                                                was setting her own character
                                                up. I\u2019m still unsure about
                                                what she\u2019s trying to do
                                                here: whether Alveston is
                                                intended to be an earnest little

                                                family business, or the voice of

                                                The former seems to imply that
                                                feminism is rather unnecessary
                                                in a well-ordered country house
                                                where the patriarch is a decent
                                                fellow, and the latter to imply
                                                (once again) that Austen managed
                                                to miss the great world outside
                                                her village.<\/p>\n
