  I always worry about writing about theatre. I worry I&#8217;m not going to
  write about it like everyone else. I had this problem at Uni, where I studied
  the bloody thing. Everyone else would write about it in this classic,
  scholarly way and there&#8217;d be analysis and secondary critics and stuff,
  and I&#8230; well.<\/p>\n

  Have you ever seen those videos of Harry Potter fans in Japan? Go and YouTube
  some now. Okay. I&#8217;m like that, but with Jacobean revenge tragedies. I
  will camp out on the internet and snipe front row tickets and then work
  seventy hours of overtime to afford them. I will sob behind my fingers and
  moan, &#8220;<em
    >Their love is so real<\/em>&#8221; to myself as characters stab each other
    up on stage. I will embarrass the actors and everyone around me by
    simultaneously crying and cheering during the applause at the end. I&#8217;m
    getting a tattoo of one of the stage directions from <a

            target=\"_blank\"><strong

              aforementioned
              <strong
                >&#8216;Tis Pity She&#8217;s A Whore<\/strong> at the Cambridge
                Arts Theatre last week. It&#8217;s a modern dress production,
                featuring a single, static set, a nearly omnipresent ensemble
                cast, and modern dance. Oh, and lots and lots of sex and
                violence. It&#8217;s directed by <a

                  >Declan Donnellan<\/strong><\/a>, who took a modern dress
                  production around London in the &#8217;80s, and this is his

                  the Sydney Festival, before coming to roost in London&#8217;s

                    Before I trundle on in my usual obtuse fashion, let me
                    outline the plot of
                    <strong
                      >&#8216;Tis Pity<\/strong> for you, in case you
                      don&#8217;t know it. Once upon a time in Parma, Giovanni
                      falls in love with his sister Annabella. It&#8217;s
                      requited and consensual and they carry on in secret for
                      some time. Annabella is, unfortunately, being courted by
                      sixty zillion guys other than her brother, and her
                      father&#8217;s all, &#8220;please marry someone because
                      your brother&#8217;s a bit useless, ps. don&#8217;t marry
                      your brother lol&#8221;. It&#8217;s all okay and she can
                      put off marriage virtually indefinitely, which is relevant
                      to her interests because she&#8217;s in a very nice
                      relationship with Giovanni, ta very much AND THEN SHE
                      BECOMES THE PREGNANT and GUESS WHAT it&#8217;s obviously
                      her brother&#8217;s. So, in order to divert the dreadful
                      shame of being pregnant out of wedlock, she marries Suitor
                      #1, Soranzo, who is not a very nice man (with previous
                      abusive history) and who has an even worse manservant
                      called Vasques, who likes to shiv people. Soranzo finds
                      out Annabella&#8217;s pregnant, Vasques does some
                      Sherlocking and finds out it&#8217;s Giovanni&#8217;s, and
                      Giovanni, with time-honoured 24-carat flawless logic,
                      decides to avert the on-coming crisis by killing
                      Annabella, ripping out her heart, and taking the heart to
                      a party. Then, everyone dies.<\/p>\n
                      <p>It&#8217;s the best play.<\/p>\n</p>
                      <p>
                        I was amazed at the audience, first. It was all &#8211;
                        ALL &#8211; middle class couples about twice my age!
                        They didn&#8217;t look as though they were there for the
                        same reasons I was, to put it tactfully. I felt
                        decidedly shifty in my spiked collar and skinny jeans,
                        with my boyfriend and my &#8216;hawk haircut. Aside from
                        the central relationship, I was looking forward to
                        seeing how homoerotic this production had made
                        Vasques&#8217;s relationship with his master, Soranzo.
                        And, yes, I wanted to see squirting blood and
                        eye-gouging. That&#8217;s what I was there for, and I
                        clutched my Feelings Scarf (the stripy scarf I take to
                        every film or play I see so that I can cuddle it and cry
                        into it; I am ridiculous) and was essentially self
                        conscious right up until Annabella (<strong
                          >Lydia Wilson<\/strong>) came on stage.<\/p>\n
                          <p>
                            As soon as she emerged, I lost my
                            comparing-myself-to-the-audience anxiety completely.
                            With
                            <strong
                              >&#8216;Tis Pity<\/strong>, I&#8217;m used to
                              Annabella being painted as this passive recipient
                              of Giovanni&#8217;s (<strong
                                >Jack Gordon<\/strong>) affections. She is
                                tossed about between her suitors and her
                                brother, and it&#8217;s never really clear what
                                she wants because you only ever see her through
                                the lens of the men and their desires &#8211; so
                                she&#8217;s this unattainable, Madonna\/whore
                                figure that I&#8217;d never really felt I could
                                connect with.<\/p>\n
                                <p>
                                  Not this Annabella! Nope. She&#8217;s a tiny,
                                  scrappy waif with a half-shaved head and
                                  tangled hair, adjusting her laptop with her
                                  feet so that she can watch a film with her
                                  headphones on. Her bedroom &#8211; the set
                                  where the whole thing takes place &#8211; is
                                  adorned with posters for

                                      <strong
                                        >The Vampire Diaries<\/strong>. She has
                                        tattoos and scruffy sneakers. Just
                                        visually, I found her easy to bond with:
                                        like someone I could have met in the
                                        pub. &#8220;Shame, though,&#8221; I
                                        thought, watching her bounce about on
                                        her bed, waiting for the lights to drop
                                        and the play to properly start,
                                        &#8220;that the play is mostly from
                                        Giovanni&#8217;s
                                        perspective.&#8221;<\/p>\n
                                        <p>
                                          While that&#8217;s textually true, it
                                          certainly wasn&#8217;t the case for
                                          this production, which literally
                                          revolves around Annabella. She&#8217;s
                                          practically on stage all the time,
                                          even when she&#8217;s not
                                          participating in a scene. She&#8217;s
                                          picked up and hoisted about. She leads
                                          the dance numbers. She gets dressed up
                                          as a Madonna, complete with lit-up
                                          fairylight halo. She has all these
                                          extra actions and reactions, and when
                                          she speaks, she speaks&#8230; clearly.
                                          She fights back when Soranzo (<strong
                                            >Jack Hawkins<\/strong>) hits her.
                                            Her decisions about herself and her
                                            love life are clearly made,
                                            physically and verbally, and she
                                            makes her mind explicit. I was,
                                            frankly, amazed, having never really
                                            seen Annabella performed with this
                                            kind of clarity and sympathy before.
                                            I&#8217;m normally a Giovanni kind
                                            of guy &#8211; I always read him as
                                            this obsessive, devoted, atheist
                                            whose life is ruined by his social
                                            context and coercively-assigned
                                            religion, but Donnellan&#8217;s
                                            staging gives Annabella such agency
                                            that watching it, I found my
                                            allegience changed.<\/p>\n

                                              Soranzo, Annabella&#8217;s abusive
                                              suitor, whom she marries in haste
                                              to cover her pregnancy, was also
                                              painted rather more
                                              sympathetically than usual, which
                                              I found problematic. Yes, I know
                                              it&#8217;s boring and tedious to
                                              have Soranzo just be this using,
                                              bastardous wanker with no other
                                              dimensions at all, but, for the
                                              love of god, he hits her! He hits
                                              her and draws blood! He beats her
                                              and fetches a coathanger as if to
                                              forcibly abort her pregnancy! Come
                                              on! And then, we get this bizarre
