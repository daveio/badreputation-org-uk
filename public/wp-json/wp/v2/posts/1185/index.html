    >GUEST POST SHOUTOUT: The Working Girl, who&#8217;s guestposting for us
    today, <a href=\"http:\/\/21centuryworkinggirl.wordpress.com\/\">blogs on
    the world of work, politics and feminism over here<\/a>. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p

      <p>
        Bless the Labour government of 1997-2010. They did quite a bit of good.
        Minimum wage, Northern Ireland and Civil Partnerships are all some of my
        favourite things, behind whiskers on kittens. They did, however, invent
        an awful lot of tosh to appear modern and popular.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        One of these inventions was the post of Minister for Women. Created in
        1997 and given first to Harriet Harman (who was also the last Labour
        minister to hold the post in 2010), it was meant to look at gender
        inequality throughout Britain. The post was expanded to look at other
        inequalities and discrimination in 2007 and now the full title is
        Minister for Women and Equalities. Because women are so<a
        href=\"http:\/\/www.parliament.uk\/documents\/commons\/lib\/research\/briefings\/snsg-01250.pdf\">
        under-represented in Parliament<\/a> (although you\u2019ll be forgiven
        for not being bowled over by the number of ethnic minorities either),
        the specific<br \ />\ntitle \u2018Minister for Women\u2019 has been
        retained.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a few issues with this. One I would like to illustrate using
        Ainsley Hayes, she of the long blond hair and happy gun-toting
        Republican ways in Season 2 of
        <strong
          >The West Wing<\/strong>. When being invited back to her alma mater to
          debate the Equal Rights Amendment (which specifically stated that
          discrimination against anyone because of their gender was illegal),
          Sam assumes she\u2019s all for it. She\u2019s not, and here\u2019s
          why:<\/p>\n
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              It&#8217;s humiliating. A new amendment we vote on declaring that
              I am equal under the law to a man? I am mortified to discover
              there is reason to believe I wasn&#8217;t before. I am a citizen
              of this country; I am not a special subset in need of your
              protection. I do not have to have my rights handed down to me by a
              bunch of old white men. The same article fourteen that protects
              you protects me, and I went to law school just to make
              sure.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n

            </p>
            <p>
              I don\u2019t understand why we are singled out for special rights
              as if we need protection \u2013 we\u2019ve already passed various
              laws stipulating that I cannot be paid less or treated with
              disrespect or sexually harassed because of my gender. I\u2019m OK
              with these laws. I want to see society catch up with our
              legislation, but I feel that having a specific Minister for people
              like me who have ovaries is, quite frankly, patronising.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              It\u2019s also completely redundant. If they actually did anything
              to stem the misogyny and discrimination faced by women every day,
              I\u2019d applaud. But they don\u2019t, because they can\u2019t,
              because so much of what we face is ingrained within society.
              We\u2019re slowly turning it around \u2013 another hundred years
              or so and we might be nearly there \u2013 but I don\u2019t think
              having a specific Minister stops any employer in their tracks from
              giving that woman a smaller pay raise than her male counterpart,
              or that man over there denying his wife the right to work because
              he wants her to have his dinner ready every day, or that assistant
              from cutting and pasting his female boss\u2019 head onto the Page
              3 girl and sending it round the office.<\/p>\n<div

            <p>
              Finally, my huge issue with our Minister for Women and Equalities
              is that it\u2019s always given to a woman, generally as an
              additional role to her main ministerial duties. This sends the
              message that gender equality is something additional, not
              important enough to be a main duty \u2013 and it\u2019s certainly
              a woman\u2019s issue, nothing for the men to worry about, hur hur.
              By placing this so predominantly in the female sphere, we are
              telling men that they don\u2019t need to think about gender
              equality, that it\u2019s fine for them so they shouldn\u2019t
              fight for it, that it\u2019s purely something that the
              discriminated against need to fight for and correct.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              Our next Minister for Women and Equalities should be a man. Then
              they have to argue that women\u2019s rights are a necessity that
              are already afforded to men without question, that gender
              inequality affects children of both genders by reducing financial
              remuneration and by encouraging stereotypes, that maybe, just
              maybe, men can be feminists too. Sad that having a man in the role
              would make other men sit up and notice, but at this point in time,
              I\u2019m willing to use all my tools in my box. If they won\u2019t
              listen to women\u2019s issues when declared by a woman, then maybe
              it\u2019s time for the testosterone to even things up a little and
              help bring gender equality into the male-dominated public
              sphere.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em
