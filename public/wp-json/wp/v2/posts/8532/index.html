                        the &#8216;saw a woman in half&#8217; phenomenon &#8211;
                        seems like there are both political\u00a0 and practical
                        reasons why horror can fall into misogyny. Is this stuff
                        as common as people think?<\/strong><\/p>\n

                            tons. We choose not to put on plays like that as
                            they don\u2019t interest us, but in the 1940s and
                            50s when the Grand Guignol was trying to compete
                            with Hammer<em
                              ><\/em>, they wrote pure exploitation crap.
                              It\u2019s true of all kinds of horror: you can
                              tell a form is dying when it spills out pure
                              sexualised violence. It doesn\u2019t take much
                              money or skill to produce, but it sells, so the
                              lower end of the horror market is flooded with
                              this kind of thing.<\/p>\n

                                  hacked up. Bad horror tends towards unthinking
