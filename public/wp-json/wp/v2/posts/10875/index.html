<blockquote>
  <p>
    In 1937 Goebbels presented a birthday gift of 18 Mickey Mouse shorts to the
    F\u00fchrer.\u00a0[&#8230;Disney] and Hitler [&#8230;] shared an overall
    social vision. They dreamed of a dispersed post-urban society, with a
    population \u2014 kept in line by a strong domestic realm instilling a keen
    sense of blood loyalty and &#8220;family values&#8221; \u2014 that could be
    efficiently mobilized to serve either the military needs of the state or the
    labor needs of industry.<\/p>\n

          It starts with Pinocchio, and the Fox and the Cat. Probably best
          remembered for their song &#8216;<a
          href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DEQjgGMKqt8\">An
          Actor&#8217;s Life for Me<\/a>&#8216;, it&#8217;s this pair of crooks
          that first lure young Pinocchio off the straight and narrow. And I
          mean that literally: they&#8217;re Theatre Folk, dapper, urbane and
          not a little camp. Their bodies are constantly intertwining, grotesque
          and chaotic. I&#8217;m with Matt Roth when he says they&#8217;re
          obviously coded as gay &#8211; one of the key minorities Hitler
          argued, in\u00a0<strong
            >Mein Kampf<\/strong>, were\u00a0threatening the health and morality
            of contemporary European youth.<\/p>\n
            <p>
              But this doesn&#8217;t end with the fall of Hitler; later Disney
              films work their way through a succession of sexually deviant or
              ambiguous villains. The first significant entrant is the
              terrifying <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Maleficent\"
              title=\"Wikipedia: Maleficent\">Maleficent<\/a> in\u00a0<strong

                  >Aladdin<\/strong>&#8216;s\u00a0Jafar (1992), she is elegant
                  and a bit camp, though fundamentally sexless (witness how
                  unattracted Jafar is to Princess Jasmine, wanting her only for
                  political gains). Maleficent inhabits a strange underworld
                  where orgiastic parties are the norm, and, like so many of her
                  villainous successors, she&#8217;s got no-one of her own, but
                  still remains determined to thwart the monogamous,
                  heterosexual union of the noble royals Princess Aurora and
                  Prince Philip (whose name was chosen by Uncle Walt in the 50s,
                  when our Prince Philip was still someone nostalgia-loving

                      child-snatching boogyman. Her hyper-femme fashion sense

                      Cruella&#8217;s flamboyant yet barren sexuality focuses
                      itself instead on fetishising the traditional trappings of
