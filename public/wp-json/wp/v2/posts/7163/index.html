        As a twelve-year-old in a post-industrial backwater, I discovered punk a
        long time after the fact, but when I did I took to it like a mohawked
        and safety-pinned duck to water. With the snobbery and omnicognisance of
        youth, however, I quickly developed a doctrinaire approach whereby if
        \u2018punk\u2019 songs weren\u2019t short, sharp, and shouty, I
        didn\u2019t want to know. Man, did

          take on reggae and soul and funk and lovers&#8217; rock and, god

            <strong
              >London Calling<\/strong> I swore never to listen to a good
              two-thirds of it again because it clearly wasn&#8217;t Real Punk.
              Like all teenage girls, I was insufferable.<\/p>\n

                        untrained, scraps of mad genius that formed the <a

                        I read, suspiciously. One of the most lauded of postpunk
                        bands were the Raincoats. So I tried, but at the age of
                        thirteen or so I never could click with them or their
                        kind of folk-punk-gypsy-jazz-spoken-word-world-music
                        tapestry. What was the relationship this band allegedly
                        bore to punk? Where were the tightly-wound two-minute
                        blasts of guitar scree and rants about boredom,
                        alienation, nihilism, concrete and bad sex? The
                        Raincoats\u2019 hesitant, eerie, self-effacing, gentle
                        and loose-knit stylings were something I had no patience
                        for and no sympathy with. I didn\u2019t get it, and the
                        suggestion that this was music which, as a female, I
                        <em
                          >should<\/em> get, I found frankly offensive. It said
                          nothing to me about my life.<\/p>\n

                              A couple of years later, as contemporary grunge
                              and riot grrrl joined vintage punk in my
                              affections, Kurt Cobain\u2019s referencing of the
                              Raincoats made me give them a second chance, or at
                              least a second listen. This time around I could
                              discern something I could identify with, something
                              that was tangled up with the altered territory of
                              adolescence. The burgeoning horror of growing up,
                              the all-encompassing anxiety over my looks, my
                              body, my clothes, was something the Raincoats now
                              spoke to. There was an obvious prototype for riot
                              grrrl\u2019s anatomising of feminine neurosis and
                              feminist analysis of the personal and political.

                              confidence rather than fear, the baffling
                              revelation that falling in love can be more
                              nauseating angst than fairytale bliss, the
                              terrifying tricks that biology and psychology can
                              play on you &#8211; it was all here, just
                              expressed through suggestion rather than

                                Being a woman is both feeling female, expressing
                                female and also (for the time being at least)
                                reacting against what a woman is told she
                                \u2018should\u2019 be like. This contradiction

                                The untried, experimental nature of a lot of
                                postpunk music seemed particularly suited to the
                                Raincoats\u2019 female-centred concerns. Punk
                                did a great deal to remove barriers of precedent

                                    reliant on male musicians and male-defined

                                      In a sense, I\u2019m still getting into
                                      the Raincoats &#8211; they aren\u2019t a
                                      go-to listen for me, they feature on few
                                      of the playlists I throw together, and I
                                      rarely want to stick them on at parties.
                                      They\u2019re not a band I often want to
                                      listen to, but occasionally they\u2019re a
                                      band I feel I need to listen to. At any
                                      rate, they\u2019ve inspired bands,
                                      particularly women in bands, from Sonic
                                      Youth to The Gossip, and there\u2019s
                                      little doubt of their significance,
                                      interest and influence. If further proof
                                      were needed, their version of the
