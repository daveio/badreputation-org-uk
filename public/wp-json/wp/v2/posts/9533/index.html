  As is my tendency, this is <a title=\"[Gamer Diary] RPG Advertising: Where Did

    title=\"Steam\" href=\"http:\/\/store.steampowered.com\"
    target=\"_blank\">Steam<\/a> sale \u2013 it was only a fiver \u2013 and I
    had previously been rather sceptical about it.\u00a0 Nevertheless, I played
    through it and found it very refreshing as a game \u2013 very noir, good
    combat, puzzles to solve and places to explore \u2013 and the storyline was
    interesting, as was the inclusion of so many Batman baddies.\u00a0
    Basically, in short, I loved it.<\/p>\n
    <p>Mostly.<\/p>\n</p>

      to sound like a broken record but boobs on display in a high risk
      profession such as being a Gotham City criminal is not exactly clever
      \u2013 is it?\u00a0 Harley was very nice to see as a significant part of
      the story that is out to scupper your plans, but her being called some
      less-than-charming things by the Joker\u2019s own thugs was tedious to say
      the least, and when you actually fight Harley
      <em

                                            be so hard to think logically about
                                            the design of these people?\u00a0
                                            Does Batman walk around without his
                                            Kevlar body armour, flexing his

                                            not.\u00a0 So why should Catwoman,
                                            or Ivy, or Harley?\u00a0 Basic
                                            boob-sense would say maybe a comfy
                                            sports bra would be better than
                                            leather basques and flimsy shirts
                                            with only one button done up.\u00a0
                                            At least then the breast tissue
                                            wouldn\u2019t detach during all this
