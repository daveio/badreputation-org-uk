  Ten weeks ago we saw Ed Stark and pals being grim and gritty for the start of
  HBO\u2019s
  <strong
    >Game of Thrones<\/strong> series, adapted from the
    <strong
      >George R. R. Martin<\/strong> fantasy novels. Now the series is over, so
      it\u2019s time to look back and see how it fared over the course of its
      run.

        >Please note, there will almost certainly be spoilers ahead, so
        don\u2019t carry on if you\u2019ve yet to watch it all.<\/strong><\/p>\n

          In my <a
          href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/2011\/04\/20\/a-game-of-thrones-and-sex-and-violence\/\">initial
          review<\/a> of the first episode I said that the female characters
          were a bit weak, and didn\u2019t get much screen time. But, like their
          counterparts in the books, there was a good chance we\u2019d get to
          see them develop into a pretty well-rounded bunch of characters.
          Let\u2019s take a look at a few of them to see how HBO did.<\/p>\n

            data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/a>Danaerys (Emilia Clarke) was one of
            the more problematic characters in the first episode. She\u2019s
            presented as a mostly passive tool for her brother\u2019s plans of
            conquest, and pushed into a forced marriage with a disturbingly
            non-consensual first night. By the finale episode things have\u2026
            sort of improved? She has definitely developed as a character,
            becoming a leader in her own right and banishing any notions that
            she might be passive or weak (\u201cI do not have a gentle
            heart,\u201d she declares).<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            She\u2019s stood up to her brother, dealt out harsh justice, and
            worked to improve people\u2019s lives by attempting to make the
            Dothraki end their practise of raping prisoners from their raids.
            Oh, and she\u2019s got her own dragons, the first to be seen in a
            long, long time. On the other hand, the presentation of the dragons
            highlights one of the remaining issues in how she\u2019s depicted.
            Rather than striding into the fire untouched and walking out
            resplendent, a reborn queen with her dragons behind her, she\u2019s
            found the next day, curled up and naked, providing the
            episode\u2019s HBO nipple quota. It\u2019s also possibly the first
            use of a strategically placed dragon in mainstream TV.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            The other issue with Danaerys is that her entire relationship with
            Khal Drogo just feels more than a little Stockholm Syndrome-y. The
            show never really addresses that first night, or the other occasions
            where we see her having sex against her will. Instead, she just
            learns to love him, and most of his respect for her seems to come
            solely from the fact she\u2019s carrying his child. It\u2019s not
            ideal.<\/p>\n

            Cersei Lannister<\/h3>\n
            <p>
              Evil, incestuous, and an arch-schemer, Cersei (Lena Headey) was
              presented initially as almost a caricature of the Ice Queen
              archetype. Ten episodes on, and she\u2019s still evil, still
              incestuous, and still manipulative. But she\u2019s also a lot more
              human and almost sympathetic. We\u2019re given a genuinely
              revealing conversation between her and King Robert (Mark Addy), in
              which we glimpse a young woman who was married for political
              reasons to a king who was in love with a dead woman. We see how,
              raised for almost exactly this purpose, she tried to make it work,
              and how their flaws destroyed them and bought them to the sad
              state they\u2019re in now. It makes her something a little more
              interesting than just evil for evil\u2019s sake.<\/p>\n

                arranged marriage is the young Sansa Stark (Sophie Turner).
                She\u2019s perhaps the one we\u2019ve seen the least progress
                out of. Raised from birth to meet the expectations of what a
                noble lady should be, and to someday marry a prince and have
                lots of little noble children, she\u2019s got a lot of
                conditioning to overcome.<\/p>\n

              <p>
                By the end of the series she\u2019s still the most passive of
                the characters, still being used in other peoples\u2019 schemes
                instead of forming her own. But she has at least seen that the
                dream she was sold was a false one, and that Joffrey is not a
                good king to marry, or even a remotely decent person. We get a
                brief glimpse of some steel in her as she talks back to him and
                moves to throw him off the castle wall. It\u2019s not much, and
                she\u2019s punished for it, but it gives us a hint that she
                might eventually get to be as cool as her sister.<\/p>\n

                    skilled of the two (shown in the very first episode, as she
                    makes a shot Bran can\u2019t), but as a girl it\u2019s
                    inconceivable that she could live that life, just as
                    it\u2019s impossible for Bran not to.<\/p>\n

                      the best of the bunch, in a quiet and determined way.
                      She\u2019s not got Danaerys\u2019s flair or Cersei\u2019s
                      scheming prowess, but she gets things done and will not be
                      stopped. It\u2019s Catelyn (Michelle Fairley) who comforts
                      her son after Ed\u2019s death, not the other way round.
                      It\u2019s she who sums up what needs to be done: \u201cWe
                      get the girls back. Then we kill them all.\u201d It\u2019s
                      she who walks into a not-entirely-friendly castle keep
                      alone to make the deal that\u2019ll get their army across
                      a major river. It\u2019s nice to see an older female
                      character on this show who knows what needs doing and gets
                      it done.<\/p>\n

                      On the other hand, there\u2019s an issue with the
                      repercussions of some of

                        a lot of drama, sees people killed and injured, and is
                        one of the contributing factors to the war that breaks
                        out. The whole treatment of it smacks a little too much
                        of \u201cflighty women do not think their actions
                        through, and men must pick up the pieces.\u201d
                        It\u2019s a key part of the plot in the books though, so
                        that\u2019s on Martin as much as it is on HBO.<\/p>\n

                          There\u2019s half a dozen secondary characters worth
                          discussing as well (Shae, the Wildling woman,
                          Sansa\u2019s nursemaid, Catelyn\u2019s sister), but
                          not nearly enough room to discuss them. Damn you GoT
                          for being so sprawling. Overall though, there are
                          still definite issues, and there\u2019s

                            course of the books. Roll on Spring 2012 and Season
