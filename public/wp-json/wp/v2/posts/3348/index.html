              <strong
                >Ten O\u2019Clock Live<\/strong>\u2019s exuberant attempt to
                blend righteous indignation and political analysis with gags
                about Ed Balls\u2019 surname. Britain\u2019s current political
                nightmares certainly need and deserve something like it.
                Inevitably, there\u2019s a lot to criticise: the show can be
                lightweight and facile, and its concern with playing to a broad
                audience can lead it to simplify complex issues and treat them
                in a manner often unhelpfully flippant and glib. Tonal
                inconsistency exists between its sporadically vicious satirical
                intent and the soft-soaping it tends to give when interviewing
                political figures. The much-vaunted live format adds little, the
                graphics and set make
                <strong
                  >Brass Eye<\/strong>\u2019s intentionally eye-bleeding credits
                  look soothing, and the pace of the initial episode felt
                  frenetic and rushed, as though the show\u2019s producers
                  didn\u2019t trust the audience to pay attention beyond the
                  length of a YouTube viral \u2013 although they\u2019d hardly
                  be unique in that.<\/p>\n

                      delivery and star-spangled glamour which she used to rock
                      onstage, as well as the stridently socialist principles
                      she used to espouse (in the run-up to the 1997 election,
                      she wrote a politically-conscious column for the

                        denouncing the Spice Girls as \u2018Tory scum\u2019). In
                        fairness, over ten years on, that sort of expectation
                        was both na\u00efve and nostalgic. While she wasn\u2019t
                        great, her performance didn\u2019t have me rapt in the
                        slack-jawed horror which appeared to be affecting some
                        reviewers, whose critical responses to the show singled
                        out Laverne, its only female presenter, for her
                        allegedly pointless and tokenistic inclusion and
                        relatively toothless comic chops.<\/p>\n<div

                                              When Laverne does step out of the
                                              secretarial role, she\u2019s badly
                                              served by her material. The
                                              opening show\u2019s skit in which
                                              she played an airhead newscaster
                                              may have been an attempt to play
                                              on the superficially vacuous
                                              persona which several reviewers
                                              were expecting of her, but its
                                              feeble stabs at humour reinforced
                                              the image rather than subverting
                                              it. The same was true of the
                                              recent piece in which she
                                              haplessly \u2018volunteered\u2019
                                              backstage, a part which could have
                                              been taken by one of the male
                                              presenters to make the same point
                                              \u2013 that making public services
                                              reliant on ill-informed and
                                              inexperienced amateurs is a
                                              blatantly bad idea \u2013 without
                                              the Ditzy Provincial Blonde aspect
                                              to which her material seems
                                              wedded. Elsewhere, Laverne\u2019s
                                              rants on corporate accountability
                                              and the Coalition\u2019s
                                              selling-short of liberal
                                              democracy, while gobsmackingly
                                              commendable (and she clearly means
                                              it, man), impress more for
                                              rhetorical power than comic
                                              panache. In the show\u2019s third
                                              episode she invoked the spectres
                                              of her past by quoting the Manic
                                              Street Preachers during a defence
                                              of public libraries; I loved the
                                              principles behind this piece, but
                                              it was annoyingly punctuated by
                                              lazy self-deprecating gags \u2013
                                              she\u2019s a girl, so she\u2019s
                                              looking up what
                                              \u2018menstruation\u2019 means!
                                              And she\u2019s got access to all
                                              these books, but she just wants to
                                              read something by Katie Price!
                                              \u2013 which undermined her
                                              authority to make the serious
                                              points at the sketch\u2019s heart.
                                              Again, perhaps the idea was to
                                              knowingly play on or subvert the
                                              dumb blonde image, but Laverne is
                                              alone in resorting, or having to
                                              resort, to jokes at her own
                                              expense rather than that of the
                                              show\u2019s purported targets.
                                              Laverne is also a mother who
                                              frequently mentions taking her
                                              kids to the local library \u2013
                                              this angle could have been used to
                                              support her case as well as
                                              introducing nuance to her persona,
                                              but I guess motherhood would have
                                              been unsexily out of step with the
                                              show\u2019s desired audience. In a
                                              comedy catch-22, while I\u2019d
                                              like her to be more than the
                                              attractive anchorwoman, when she
                                              does so the material she\u2019s
                                              given seems to reinforce the
                                              recommendation that she stick to
                                              presenting.<\/p>\n<p
