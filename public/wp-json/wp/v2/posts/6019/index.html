      So, <a
      href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/world\/2011\/jun\/17\/saudi-arabia-women-drivers-protest?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\">this
      happened<\/a>.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      In case you&#8217;ve been on the other side of the moon these past few
      months, the media&#8217;s much-touted <a
      href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Arab_Spring\">Arab Spring<\/a> had
      an interesting tangent via a discussion in the Saudi\u00a0Council on
      whether women in Saudi Arabia should be allowed the vote. They eventually
      decided that yes, <a
      href=\"http:\/\/www.digitaljournal.com\/article\/311355\">they probably
      should&#8230; eventually<\/a>. We wouldn&#8217;t want to rush these
      things. They won&#8217;t be able to contest the elections, of course, but
      least &#8211; if King Abdullah considers the recommendations &#8211; they
      may be able to cast a vote in the municipal elections.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Except that this small pittance of representation didn&#8217;t seem to be
      <a
      href=\"http:\/\/gulfnews.com\/news\/gulf\/saudi-arabia\/saudi-s-vote-for-women-comes-a-little-late-activists-say-1.818813\">satisfactory
      for women in Saudi Arabia<\/a>. So&#8230; well, see for yourselves. <a
      href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=sowNSH_W2r0\">Here is Manal
      al-Sharif driving in Saudi Arabia, and discussing what it means for her to
      do so<\/a>.<\/p>\n

    <p>
      She was arrested and imprisoned for 10 days for daring to drive.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      She&#8217;s not the only one. There&#8217;s an <a
      href=\"http:\/\/www.falsafh.com\/vb\/t7868.html\">entire site of these
      vids<\/a>\u00a0(<a
      href=\"http:\/\/www.saudiwomendriving.blogspot.com\/\">in fact<\/a>, <a
      href=\"http:\/\/www.google.co.uk\/search?q=saudi+women+driving&amp;hl=en&amp;biw=1259&amp;bih=599&amp;prmd=ivnsu&amp;source=univ&amp;tbm=vid&amp;tbo=u&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AJnuTY-DCYyVswamo43vAw&amp;ved=0CG4QqwQ\">more
      than one<\/a>): women driving in Saudi Arabia, in protest at&#8230; well,
      mostly not being allowed to drive.\u00a0Here&#8217;s a <a
      href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/@women2drive\">twitter feed<\/a> of them
      doing it in style. In fact, June 17 saw 30 or 40 women behind the wheel,
      following weeks of an online campaign that saw women taping or
      photographing themselves driving. (If you&#8217;re wondering whether 30-40
      people is a lot, consider what happened <a
      href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-middle-east-13809684\">the last
      time women tested this ban<\/a>. Think about what &#8216;punishment&#8217;
      means in Saudi Arabia. Then try to imagine being one of those women out
      there on 17 June.)<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      There is, of course, a danger to conflating correlation and causality.
      Yes, women protesting by driving happened to take place at about the same
      time that women&#8217;s voting rights were being revived for discussion in
      Saudi Arabia. It could have been a massive coincidence, and 30-40 women,
      however courageous, hardly make up a political movement all by themselves.
      And anyway, <a
      href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2011_Saudi_Arabian_protests\">what
      does driving have to do with political representation<\/a>?<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >The Times<\/strong>&#8216;s Janice Turner is pretty clear where she
        stands in a now-paywalled article titled
        <em
          >The Freedom of the Road is a Feminist Issue<\/em>. Consider being a
          woman in Saudi Arabia. Ignore all the discussions about political
          representation for the moment, and focus instead on the daily grind.
          You get up, you get dressed, you have to go to work or to the market
          or whatever.\u00a0Luckily, your husband has hired you a car with your
          very own (male) driver&#8230; and should he feel perfectly comfortable
          in <a
          href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/hostednews\/afp\/article\/ALeqM5jCjEMaKSS2DG4aQE69Xd7dF-N_OA?docId=CNG.a3efd0be8f9ab484f7bd5528447add10.3d1\">sexually
          assaulting you<\/a>, there is nothing you can do about it.<\/p>\n
          <p>
            Or how about you forgo the potential dubious safety of a hired car
            and opt for a taxi. Prepare to walk the streets trying to hail one:
            streets where your mere presence outdoors may be cast as a sexual
            provocation. Inevitably, in trying to lock women away &#8216;for
            their own protection&#8217;,\u00a0lest they be seen by vociferous
            male eyes, the Wahhabi religious laws have created a space so deeply
            hostile and threatening to women that their mere presence is
            transgressive. It is little wonder, then, that <a
            href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Manal_al-Sharif\">Manal
            al-Sharif<\/a> talks about how safe she feels in her car, with her
            doors locked.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            A person&#8217;s first car has always symbolised their freedom: be
            it at 17, with their newly-minted license and the entirety of the
            countryside filled with welcoming ditches to drive it into, or at
            50, with a newly-issued divorce and a hesitant rediscovery of
            independent living. A woman who has a car gets to choose the place
            she is occupying. If she wants to leave, she is not dependent on
            anyone else. What could be more terrifying to the Saudi religious
            leaders? Never mind that neither the Koran nor the law bans women
            from driving; they were so terrified at the freedom driving would
            afford women that they went ahead and <a
            href=\"http:\/\/www.equalitynow.org\/node\/837\">issued a fatwa<\/a>
            just to be safe.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_7393\" style=\"width:

            So what actually happened on June 17th, when these 30-40 women took
            to the road? Did governments fall or cities rock? Reports differ.
            For one thing, no one can agree on the number. Even the
            <strong
              >Guardian<\/strong> seems confused, using the 30-40 figure in one
              article, and &#8220;<a
              href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/commentisfree\/2011\/jun\/18\/saudi-arabia-women-drivers-protest\">at
              least 45<\/a>&#8221; in another. The government of Saudi Arabia is
              in flat-out denial, refusing to acknowledge that the protest
              happened at all (despite a traffic ticket being issued).<\/p>\n
              <p>
                Two weeks on, <a
                href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/world\/2011\/jun\/29\/saudi-women-drivers-arrested-jiddah\">five
                of the drivers were arrested<\/a>, despite early comments from
                the government that they would allow their families to &#8216;<a
                href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/world\/2011\/jun\/30\/saudi-arabia-not-egypt-reform\">deal
                with them<\/a>&#8216;. Despite this, campaigners are not
                deterred, continuing to maintain a <a
                href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/business-13928215\">significant
                social media presence<\/a>.\u00a0And even before the protest
                took place the Shoura declare that <a
                href=\"http:\/\/arabnews.com\/saudiarabia\/article447421.ece\">they
                were ready to discuss women driving &#8220;if
                requested<\/a>&#8220;. I&#8217;m thinking that women risking
                arrest in order to parallel park in Riyadh would qualify as
                such.<\/p>\n

                Meanwhile, Manal al-Sharif hasn&#8217;t given up. Since her
                release from custody, the former prisoner of conscience has
                been\u00a0<a
