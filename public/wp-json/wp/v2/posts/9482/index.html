    >Guardian\u2019s<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/
    www.guardian.co.uk\/commentisfree\/2012\/jan\/16\/ditching-dieting-diets-dont-
    work\">call for responses on body image<\/a>, but I had more to say than
    would have fitted into their 200-300 word limit.<\/p>\n
    <p>
      For starters: I am overweight and I am not fucked up about it. Here are
      some of my thoughts on a lifetime of body-based bullshit \u2013 a lot of
      which I only started to realise and address when I joined a gym for the
      first time this year.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      I\u2019m going to focus on the body shape and exercise side of things here
      because food and loathing is in itself a subject which would take more
      word count to tackle than our lovely editor has time to read through.
      Suffice to say that due to being raised right I have always known how to
      eat healthily, and that \u2018diet\u2019 is a four letter word. I&#8217;ve
      sometimes felt a bit left out of the whole dumbass \u2018detox fat flush
      carb starve blah blah fad\u2019 being discussed around the water cooler,
      but I\u2019m also profoundly grateful that self-hatred regarding food has
      never been my mother tongue. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I&#8217;m not
      particularly confident about my body, but crucially it&#8217;s never been
      the main thing I measure my self-worth by. I can&#8217;t begin to express
      how grateful I am that I dodged that bullet.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      I have always been overweight (to varying degrees), but I&#8217;ve also
      always been pretty active (my post-viral fatigue syndrome years
      notwithstanding). For the last few years I&#8217;ve been swimming around a
      mile a week (sometimes more), I do some yoga, and every couple of years I
      start working out for a bit. Often people do a double-take when they find
      out that I swim a lot. &#8216;But you&#8217;re a size 16. Does not
      compute!&#8217; As <a
      href=\"http:\/\/www.healthateverysize.org.uk\/haes.html\"><strong
        >Health at Every Size<\/strong><\/a> can tell you, fat and fit are not
        always a dichotomy, but nonetheless the cultural assumption is that a
        big person must be stationary.<\/p>\n
        <p>
          However, since the beginning of November last year, I started
          exercising a lot (I\u2019m unemployed and needed something to keep me
          busy) and as I started to &#8216;tune up&#8217; physically I found
          myself \u2013 despite wanting to move up a gear to the next bit
          &#8211; really dragging my heels about ever moving the exercising out
          of the privacy of my room. I found myself looking up exercise
          tutorials on YouTube and then trying to figure out how to supplement
          the equipment they used with something I had lying around. (Water
          bottles filled with sand instead of weights because owning weights is
          for, y\u2019know,
          <em
            >them<\/em>\u2026 and I\u2019m not one of
            <em
              >them<\/em>.) However, at a certain point I realised that there
              weren&#8217;t many workarounds left for the machines I was
              genuinely craving a go on &#8211; I needed an actual real-life
              gym.<\/p>\n
              <p>
                Swimming (like I say, my physical activity of choice) does
                involve wearing a swimsuit, but this is one activity I was
                raised with, and something about being submerged once
                you&#8217;re in, about not ever getting sweaty, about not having
                to make eye contact with anyone else, made me think of it as the
                exception to the &#8216;exercise is scary&#8217; rule. Gyms
                remained terrifying to me.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_9483\"

              <p>
                I&#8217;d never been inside a gym before this year, and I was
                convinced that it would be stuffed with supermodel-beautiful
                people. I was sure the moment I walked in the music would stop
                playing and everyone would turn and stare like I&#8217;d walked
                into the wrong saloon in a bad western.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                When I finally just bit the bullet and went, I was relieved to
                find out it was full of a range of shapes, sizes and ages, and I
                did fine on the machines. The guy who did the induction just
                talked me through how to use each machine, set a goal and left
                me to it. No hectoring, shouting, or close-ups on unflattering
                areas <a
                href=\"http:\/\/www.channel4.com\/programmes\/the-fat-fighters\">like
                they do on the TV<\/a>.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                I realised later it wasn&#8217;t my own performance I was
                worried about (I know I&#8217;m pretty fit these days \u2013 I
                barely got out of breath), but an internalised shame about being
                a larger person being seen doing exercise at all. I realised I
                saw exercise as a &#8216;thin person&#8217; activity.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                I get that if you&#8217;re aiming to get fitter, thinner or
                both, then a gym sure as hell helps, but still I was reluctant.
                It didn\u2019t seem to make any sense \u2013 but then I
                realised: all the shame and embarrassment I was feeling
                wasn&#8217;t about me, it was a response to a lifetime of
                others\u2019 assumptions. Experiences like being laughed at if I
                got pink-faced after running somewhere, or always being picked
                last for the teams in PE (despite being pretty good at football
                back then &#8211; fuck you, my Year 5 class), or a school bully
                cackling loudly when she overheard me say to a friend
                &#8220;yeah, sure, I&#8217;ll meet you after dance club&#8221;.
                My own abilities didn\u2019t put me off exercise &#8211; other
                people\u2019s (conscious and unconscious) group shaming
                did.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                In fact, avoidance of embarrassment has been seen to be one of
                the largest factors inhibiting girls in the UK from doing PE.
                The <a

              <blockquote>
                <p>
                  It is important to recognise the significance of girls&#8217;
                  early experiences of physical activity and it is often within
                  the context of physical education lessons where understanding
                  of individual sporting identity is developed &#8230; what were
                  initially regarded as lesser concerns for school governing
                  bodies, such as specific uniforms for physical education
                  lessons and the standards of showering facilities were shown
                  to be significant aspects in girls&#8217; actual enjoyment of
                  school sports.<\/p>\n

                <p>
                  [&#8230;] in sports there are many occasions where the body is
                  literally displayed and this has the potential for the
                  individual to be exposed to negative emotional experiences of
                  shame and embarrassment.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n

                    I am still haunted by the memories of the <a

                    <p>
                      Anyone who does any sports or goes to the gym will tell
                      you: you will get sweaty &#8211; that\u2019s how it works
                      &#8211; but in my teens (and even before) how well you did
                      at PE wasn\u2019t half as important as avoiding the
                      indignity of getting sweaty, red-faced or out of breath.
                      As a chubbier kid, I was an even easier target for the
                      standard crap.<\/p>\n

                        beautiful people &#8211; is it any wonder that the
                        perceived embarrassment of getting hot, sweaty or out of
                        breath is prohibitive to many people? The Surgeon

                        be a small contributing factor<\/a> in putting many
                        women off exercise, and in a world where a bad hair day
                        for some celebrities can make it to the press, is it any
                        wonder that the trickle-down effect has been to make
                        ordinary women self-conscious about these things
                        too?<\/p>\n
                        <p>
                          Fat-shaming is not just a shitty way to treat people
                          (duh) &#8211; it&#8217;s also utterly
                          counter-productive. To be honest I only ever felt
                          moderate embarrassment about my figure, but I felt
                          acutely ashamed of my body in relation to exercise. I
                          felt that because of my body shape, certain doors were
                          closed to me. Ironically, most of those doors were
                          ones that led to better fitness and possibly even
                          changing my shape.<\/p>\n

                          exercise was for horrible\/vain\/stupid people. When I
                          started exercising, I started working through all the
                          years of rubbish I\u2019d accumulated in relation to
                          physical activity &#8211; and my self-image has done
                          far more of a reshape than my body has over the past
                          three months (though the body\u2019s coming along
                          nicely, thanks for asking). While I\u2019ve been
                          really enjoying exercising under my own steam,
                          I\u2019ve also been exorcising the ghosts of
                          schoolyards past.<\/p>\n
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Some of the things that kicked me into upping my
                          exercise ante were finding friends of mine were into
                          certain sports and realising that exercising was
                          actually a pretty normal thing that pretty normal
                          people do. Not everyone who goes to the gym is either
                          a supermodel or a wanker. And some exercise can be
                          pretty badass (I&#8217;m still looking for boxing
                          lessons locally &#8211; I really want to hit
                          things).<\/p>\n

                        <p>
                          So, uh, morals. Well, the moral of the story is
                          don&#8217;t be scared of new stuff, and if you are
                          trying to get healthier then for God&#8217;s sake
                          don&#8217;t worry about other people. You\u2019re not
                          at school anymore and no one gives a crap. That
                          haw-haw Nelson Muntz kid from the playground
                          isn&#8217;t here. They&#8217;re grown up, somewhere
                          else, and would probably be embarrassed to remember
                          they were that mean. That toned person sweating on the
                          exercise bike next to you? They\u2019re much more
                          worried about their own abs than yours, and are
                          probably mentally compiling shopping lists as they go.
                          No one cares, and no one should be judging you
                          anymore. This is about you and your body. You&#8217;re
                          the one that gets to live in it.<\/p>\n<div

                                                had more to say than would have
                                                fitted into their 200-300 word
