                                        Opposed to this, we have the sort of
                                        ambiguity nowhere better demonstrated
                                        than through tanks. (yes, tanks). The <a

                                        combat tank, was renamed from &#8216;Big
                                        Willie&#8217; to &#8216;Mother&#8217;
                                        (&#8230;), and its successors were
                                        colloquially dubbed &#8216;Mother&#8217;
                                        throughout both world wars. The reasons
                                        are obvious: the inside of a tank is
                                        small, hot and protective. Childlike, a
                                        crew could be forgiven for considering
                                        themselves invincible within it \u2013
                                        yet once the fuel tank is hit, the men
                                        inside suffer a hideous, incestuous
                                        death, incinerated by their own machine.
                                        This sort of thing runs right the way
                                        through conceptions of the
                                        mother&#8217;s body, particularly in <a

                                        mother-child relationships, and with
