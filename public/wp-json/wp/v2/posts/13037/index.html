      London feminist club night
      <strong
        >Girl Germs<\/strong>, to give us some tips about how it&#8217;s done.

              >Girl Germs<\/strong><\/a> is our DIY feminist, queer and trans*
              friendly club night, and soon-to-be record label. We started in
              2008, as part of our university\u2019s Feminist Week. We hired out
              the student union bar, and suddenly we had four bands booked. We
              had a lot of help from the staff at the union, and our friends in
              the Feminist Society blew up loads of balloons for us. And on the
              night, people turned up! To a club night that we arranged!<\/p>\n
              <p>
                When we graduated, we decided that we wanted to do it again. We
                were a bit cautious, though, as suddenly we were dealing with
                real venues and it was just the two of us (and our friend Tukru,
                with her <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vampiresushi.co.uk\/\"
                target=\"_blank\">amazing zine distro<\/a>). We put on several
                nights in Camden with no bands where we\u2019d DJ for hours,
                sometimes getting our friends to help us out when we got tired.
                Our little venue was always full, and everybody left tired and
                sweaty.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_13046\" style=\"width:

                But it was during the preparations for <a
                href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/2010\/12\/02\/five-things-i-found-at-ladyfest-ten\/\">Ladyfest
                Ten<\/a> that we plucked up the courage to put on another
                full-scale night with bands. We managed to put on three of our
                favourite bands and organise DJs, stalls and even cake.
                We\u2019d somehow pulled it off again! The place was packed, and
                we were exhausted, but ecstatic.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                The plan was to build on the success of that night, but mental
                health issues and a period of unemployment and geographical
                separation meant it was impossible. We\u2019re back next month
                though, and more excited than ever.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                We\u2019ve learned a lot through running Girl Germs. But the
                biggest thing is: running a club night is easy. Most promoters
                don\u2019t want you to know that, because they don\u2019t want
                you to try it yourself. We\u2019re poor, unsociable and uncool.
                We spend a lot of time talking to our cat. If we can do it, so
                can you.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <h2>
                You don\u2019t need a lot of money<\/h2>\n
                <p>
                  We both work really hard in low-paid jobs. We don\u2019t have
                  trust funds, or any disposable income to speak of at all,
                  really. A night can be as expensive or cheap as you make it.
                  There are very few upfront costs, because bands and venues can
                  be paid on the night from your door takings. It\u2019s also
                  kind of a waste to spend loads of money on fancy flyers,
                  because the most effective promotion now happens online
                  through social media. We spend a little money on photocopying
                  beforehand, but that\u2019s about it.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <h2>
                  You don\u2019t need \u2018connections\u2019<\/h2>\n
                  <p>
                    To have connections, you\u2019d probably need to network,
                    and who wants to do that? We don\u2019t have a little black
                    book with useful emails in. We just write to bands we like
                    and venues we think might want us, and ask nicely. It\u2019s
                    much easer that way, especially if you\u2019re shy. Hell, we
                    barely have the courage to speak to bands when they\u2019re
                    at Girl Germs ready to play.<\/p>\n
                  </p>
                  <h2>
                    You don\u2019t need technical knowledge<\/h2>\n
                    <p>
                      DJing is easy, and the best way to learn is by doing. We
                      learned on the job, and it never went that badly wrong. As
                      well as that, bands will let you know what they need, and
                      venues will understand their requests. Your job is to be
                      the go-between. If you have any questions, bands and sound
                      people are always happy to answer. That\u2019s their job,
                      after all. Generally venues will have most of the gear,
                      and bands expect to bring extras themselves and sometimes
                      share with other acts on the bill.<\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <h2>
                      You don\u2019t need to spend oodles of time on it<\/h2>\n
                      <p>
                        You won\u2019t need to give up your day job to give
                        yourself enough time to do this. We have very little
                        free time in the evenings after work, but it\u2019s
                        enough to get things done.<\/p>\n
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        In the lead-up, you\u2019ll mainly be emailing people
                        and drumming up support on Twitter and Facebook. If you
                        have a smartphone, you can do this on the go (or under
                        your desk at work). You might need an evening to write a
                        press release, or an hour or so to set up a Facebook
                        page and event, but it\u2019s all manageable if
                        you\u2019re a little bit organised about it.<\/p>\n
                      </p>
                      <h2>
                        You won\u2019t need to beg venues and bands to give you
                        a chance<\/h2>\n
                        <p>
                          Venues need cub nights, and bands need gigs. People
                          need somewhere to go for a dance on a Saturday night.
                          These people aren\u2019t doing you a favour, and most
                          of them won\u2019t act like they are. Venues have
                          always been helpful and supportive to us, and bands
                          have been excited to play. As long as you let people
                          know what they\u2019re doing and when, you\u2019ll be
                          fine.<\/p>\n
                        </p>
                        <p>So, there it is. Easy, huh?<\/p>\n</p>
                        <p>
                          We\u2019d love more club nights to go to, run by
                          like-minded people. Find your own theme, and give it a
                          go. There\u2019s almost nothing more satisfying than
                          watching a room full of people dancing and knowing
                          that you got them there.<\/p>\n
                        </p>

                                        organising feminist dance parties, they
                                        enjoy bikes, knitting, gardening and
