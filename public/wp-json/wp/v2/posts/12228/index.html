<p>
  I am a gamer. First and foremost. My physical sex and gender identity do not
  factor into this. The only other identity-factors that come into play when I
  talk about gaming are age, time and style preferences: e.g.<em>
    &#8220;I&#8217;m a twenty-something gamer, I&#8217;ve been gaming for over
    17 years and I play FPS games a lot, with single-player RPGs in
    second.&#8221;<\/em> Simples, as the cool &#8216;kats say.<\/p>\n
    <p>
      I&#8217;m also a bit of an amateur linguist; I look at the language people
      use and what it means to use it in different circumstances for no other
      reason than it interests me. I&#8217;ve been considering a discussion on
      the language of gaming with BadRep for some time now, and I think this
      would be a good first topic: the problem with &#8216;girl gamer&#8217; as
      an identifier.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Obviously, everyone is welcome to self-describe however they see fit, but
      I&#8217;d just like it if people could think about this term a little bit
      before applying it to themselves or others.<\/p>\n

      \/><\/a>Let&#8217;s think about &#8216;gamer&#8217;. We all recognise this
      as meaning &#8216;someone who plays games&#8217; with the extended
      connotation nowadays that this means computer- &amp; video-games (as
      opposed to card games or board games). There&#8217;s no other extended
      definition: it&#8217;s not exclusive to male players. A gamer is just a
      person.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Now: &#8216;girl&#8217;. I have a serious problem with the general use of
      this word when referring to
      <em
        >adults<\/em>, anyway. A <a
        href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/2010\/11\/15\/an-alphabet-of-femininism-7-g-is-for-girl\/\">girl<\/a>
        or a boy is a child. Use of either when speaking of an adult is
        insulting, infantilising and diminutive. (I won&#8217;t even use the
        words boyfriend or girlfriend if I can avoid them). The problem with
        coupling &#8216;girl&#8217; with &#8216;gamer&#8217; is that it
        accentuates the misconception that the gamer in question isn&#8217;t
        mature enough or capable enough to play with the adults &#8211; thereby
        widening the void between male and female gamers and adding to the
        sexism that some experience.<\/p>\n
        <p>
          <em
            >~Insert disclaimer on how we all know that not all gamers are
            sexist. Furthermore, it&#8217;s not just male gamers who are sexist
            in gaming either.~<\/em><\/p>\n
            <p>
              Using &#8216;girl gamer&#8217; on one&#8217;s self and others is
              just adding fuel to the sexist contingent&#8217;s fire, because
              it&#8217;s a way of self-segregating, and not a very positive way
              at that. We rarely hear of other segregated terms &#8211; you
              don&#8217;t nearly as often see references to black gamers, white
              gamers, asian gamers, boy gamers, gay gamers, intergalactic
              invader gamers &#8211; at least, not in the same way. So why
              should we encourage the use of &#8216;girl gamer&#8217; if at the
              same time we&#8217;re trying to fight against being segregated
              based on sex or gender?<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              Sure, if we&#8217;re actually talking about
              <em
                >children<\/em>, then by all means use &#8216;girl&#8217;, as
                long as we&#8217;re willing to use &#8216;boy&#8217; alongside
                it. In the adult world, however, self-referral as a
                &#8216;girl&#8217; plays into the patriarchal control mechanisms
                of English, which then eke their way into the gamer
                consciousness. Unfortunately, as English-speakers, we get to
                speak a very sexist language, historically used by the powerful
                to subjugate and cling to power. In the past, those powerful
                people have primarily been male, so there&#8217;s no surprise
                that the language of the realm has been adapted to keep others
                out of power and quash protest.<\/p>\n
                <p>
                  You can see this simply in the way people talk without even
                  touching on gamers and gaming. How many times have you heard
                  someone refer to male and female adults as &#8216;guys&#8217;
                  and &#8216;girls&#8217;? &#8216;Guy&#8217; is widely accepted
                  as referencing an adult man, whereas &#8216;girl&#8217; is a
                  word for a child, and puts the women in the inferior
                  position.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  Language is important and so is the use of language. Any
                  linguist will tell you that, regardless of their sex or
                  gender. If you pause to think about it, anybody can realise
                  how important language is. The words we choose to use are
                  always vital to building the way we want to describe, discuss,
                  identify and progress. &#8216;Girl gamer&#8217; is
                  problematic. It&#8217;s used as a derogatory term by some in
                  the community to imply that female gamers are separate and
                  inept, and that they should be kept that way. Attempts at
                  reclamation of the term are fraught with complications as no
                  matter how positive the intention, it still perpetuates this
                  segregation, infatilisation and dismissal from the realm of
                  The Gamer.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  We need to remember that within gaming, it&#8217;s the game
                  that matters. Games are forms of escapism, so why should
                  anything about us personally be important when we&#8217;re
                  gaming? Yes, our identities come into play when we discuss
                  development and progression of our preferred art
                  form\/entertainment source, but when we&#8217;re playing,
                  they&#8217;re irrelevant. You don&#8217;t need to be male,
                  female, trans*, gay, straight, bi, queer, old, young, white,
                  black or anything else; when you game, you are a gamer. Anyone
                  can game, and we have the potential to create and mould a
                  fantastically inclusive community to wrap around our favourite
                  hobby &#8211; we just need to take care with how we define
                  ourselves and the language we use.<\/p>\n
