      One of the 19<sup

        the Match Girl. Standing in the snow in a tattered shawl and starving to

            dimension and a bit of agency is the Bow Bryant &amp; May match

                  Besant also learnt that the women\u2019s health had been
                  damaged by the phosphorous used to make the matches, which
                  caused yellowing of the skin, hair loss and \u2018phossy
                  jaw\u2019, a jolly name for a particularly gruesome kind of
                  facial bone cancer.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  Appalled, Besant went to the gates of the factory in Bow the
                  next day and interviewed some of the women as they were
                  leaving. Having the stories confirmed, she wrote an article
                  for her newspaper
                  <strong
                    >The Link<\/strong> with the incendiary title \u2018<a

                    <p>
                      In response to the bad PR, Bryant &amp; May cleverly
                      attempted to force their workers to sign a statement that
                      they were happy with their working conditions. When a
                      group of women refused to sign, the organisers of the
                      group were sacked, and the rest of the workforce reacted:
                      1,400 of the women at Bryant &amp; May went on
                      strike.<\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Cue national uproar. Besant gathered support for her
                      campaign from a number of prominent figures who all seem
                      to have had their own newspapers, and they used them to
                      call for a boycott of Bryant &amp; May matches. The women
                      at the company formed a Matchgirls&#8217; Union and Besant
                      agreed to become its leader. After three weeks the company
                      announced that it would re-employ the dismissed women and
                      bring an end to the fines system. The sacked women
                      returned in triumph.<\/p>\n

                        encouraged and led the factory workers to strike for
                        better conditions. Certainly the identities of the girls

                        most of the credit because she was already notorious.
                        And because she was middle class &#8211; there were
                        doubts in many circles that the matchwomen themselves
                        could have organised their way out of a paper bag

                            historians have avoided revising it. Until

                                exposes inaccuracies in the standard accounts
                                which, while petty, suggest a lazy acceptance of
                                a chronology that fits the conventional story.
                                Not only was Besant not the first mover, and she
                                was probably neither sympathetic to strike

                                BBC History magazine recorded an interview with
                                Raw, which is available as a <a

                                In the interview she names the five

                                charisma, inspiring speeches and popularity with
                                the other factory workers. Rather wonderfully,
                                Raw was able to find out more about these women

                                The Matchgirls&#8217; Strike is a landmark in
                                the history of women and protest, but also in
                                labour history. It famously inspired the
                                Dockers\u2019 Strike: the organisers sought
                                advice from the Matchgirls Union and continually
                                referenced them in their speeches.<\/p>\n
