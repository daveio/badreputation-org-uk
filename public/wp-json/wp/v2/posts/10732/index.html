Brown: on Shame and Gender"},"content":{"rendered":"
<p>
  Over 4 million people have seen <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=iCvmsMzlF7o\">Bren\u00e9
  Brown&#8217;s fantastic TED talk about Vulnerability<\/a>. She&#8217;s a
  researcher who looked into what successful people have in common, and found
  that they were all willing to make themselves vulnerable.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  I was excited when she gave a follow-up talk in March, but I didn&#8217;t
  imagine I&#8217;d be posting about it on BadRep. The reason I am is that <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=psN1DORYYV0#t=15m0s\">at 15.00
  minutes<\/a>, it became ALL about gender. (I strongly recommend you check it
  out &#8211; both videos are excellent):<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  [<A href=\"http:\/\/youtu.be\/psN1DORYYV0\">We&#8217;re having trouble with

</p>
<p>
  Shame is often strongly gendered; we are intended to feel it when we
  don&#8217;t live up to our society&#8217;s imposed, sexist expectations. She
  cites a study from Boston College which got women to answer the
  question:<\/p>\n
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    What do women need to do to conform to female norms?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n
  </p>
  <p>
    The answers were: be Nice, Thin, Modest&#8230; and &#8216;Use all available
    resources for appearance&#8217;.<\/p>\n
  </p>
  <p>
    For men, they were: Always show emotional control, Work should be your
    priority, Pursue status&#8230; and &#8216;Violence&#8217;.<\/p>\n
  </p>
  <p>
    That they&#8217;re different answers for men and women should be enough to
    prove the need for some real changes in our society by itself, but that the
    actual points are also so disgusting just seals it for me. Nice. Thin.
    Don&#8217;t make a fuss. Physical appearance is everything. Emotionally cut
    off. Violent. Competitive. Judged hugely by job and status.
    <em
      >Not one of these things is good for society.<\/em> We could lose them all
      and it would only improve everyone&#8217;s lives. (Well,
      &#8216;nice&#8217; could be okay, if it were applied to the
      <em
        >more<\/em> powerful groups in society, but in terms of gender
        you&#8217;ve then still got the &#8216;chivalry&#8217; problem &#8211;
        that men can forget about power differences <a
        href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/2012\/01\/25\/keep-the-gift-pay-what-you-owe\/\">if
        they treat women &#8216;nicely&#8217;<\/a> while giving up
        nothing.)<\/p>\n
        <p>
          Brown&#8217;s previous point had been that successful and happy people
          have to allow themselves the risk of being seen as weak, or to fail.
          However, in reaching that conclusion (and it&#8217;s definitely true),
          she only interviewed women. In this second talk she relates how a male
          fan pointed out to her that men often feel unable to choose this
          route.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Shame feels the same for men and women, but it is organised by
            gender&#8230; <\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            For men, shame is not a bunch of competing, conflicting expectations
            [as it is for women], shame is one: Do Not Be Perceived As Weak.
            <\/p>\n
          </p>

              <p>
                The fan claims that it&#8217;s the women in his family who
                reinforce this for him. In terms of how strictly the two sets of
                &#8216;norms-to-conform-to&#8217; listed above are enforced, I
                often see that men have a lot more leeway in dropping one or two
                of them&#8230; but only if they replace them with
                &#8216;money&#8217;.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                So the next time I&#8217;m looking for a shorthand example for
                why feminism is important, I&#8217;ll reference what people
                perceive as the
                <em
                  >biggest<\/em> demands by society on who they are allowed to
                  be. It&#8217;s a flawed, gender-binary test, but the fact that
                  the public returned those answers counts for a lot. That a
                  list so gendered and outrightly harmful to society should be
                  the TOP pressures many of us seem to be facing is something we
                  just don&#8217;t need. It may not be set in law, but <a
                  href=\"http:\/\/nothingbutawordbag.wordpress.com\/2012\/04\/22\/gendered-marketing-really-gets-on-my-tits\/\"
                  \/>this stuff is a strong daily message<\/a>.<\/p>\n
                  <p>
                    &#8230;Which makes me want to find a solution. Well, first
                    to scream F*** THAT and opt out, and
                    <em
                      >then<\/em> find a solution. Equality means removing this
                      heinous bullshit for
                      <em
                        >everyone<\/em>. The goals listed as the top answers in
                        that survey are both unattainable in size and harmful in
                        practice, but what choice do we have? It&#8217;s fine
                        for me to urge people to stop conforming, but for many
                        if they do the reality is they&#8217;ll never pass a job
                        interview again. (Although <a
                        href=\"http:\/\/vagendamag.blogspot.co.uk\/2012\/04\/hair-not-musical.html\">not
                        shaving your armpits or legs sometimes works out just
                        fine<\/a>). <\/p>\n
                        <p>
                          I refuse to give up. Reducing inequality towards any
                          gender is so fundamental to everyone&#8217;s happiness
                          that stuff like this just makes me more determined to
                          keep fighting: we&#8217;ve all got to keep educating
                          each other, pushing for change and making the issues
                          visible. Whether it&#8217;s about who they marry, if
                          they have sex, issues of consent, or who their
                          political leaders are, women have a lot less freedom
                          than men <a
                          href=\"http:\/\/www.womankind.org.uk\/policy-and-resources\/\">internationally<\/a>.
                          That&#8217;s not in dispute. Gender inequality is
                          measurable. If you really can&#8217;t see it, you
                          haven&#8217;t spent two seconds looking. Yes,
                          I&#8217;m also concerned with the pressures sexism
                          places on men, and I think these &#8216;norm
                          lists&#8217; showcase exactly why there&#8217;s so
                          much still to do for everybody.<\/p>\n<div

                                                feel it when we don&#8217;t live
