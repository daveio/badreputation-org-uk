        with a Dragon Tattoo. (I also think that Lina Leandersson should qualify
        in Let the Right One In.) And what about the scary, scary Yeong-ae Lee
        in Lady Vengeance, or Li Gong in Red Sorghum (with bonus
        stealth!genocide)?&#8221;<\/em> Good points all. To the sale at

                                        has always been a tricky business.
                                        Whilst there are formal definitions to
                                        be found, ultimately the concept is a
                                        fluid one: made real, developed and
                                        adapted by those that subscribe to it.
                                        So what does it actually mean for a
                                        publishing house to be steered by its
                                        feminist guiding
