            According to Eli Roth, it was a conscious choice for the first
            example of nudity in
            <strong
              >Hostel II<\/strong>\u00a0(2007) to be that of a man. Following
              the credit sequence and a quick catch up with
              <strong
                >Hostel<\/strong> survivor Paxton (Jay Hernandez), we\u2019re
                introduced to our victims.<\/p>\n
                <p>
                  Far from the seedy lights of Amsterdam, these beautiful
                  college-age women are in a life drawing class in Rome. Within
                  thirty seconds, the male nude is replaced by a female model,
                  Axelle (Vera Jordanova), who disrobes to the sound of audible
                  gasps. Her gaze lingers on our main character, Beth (Lauren
                  German). Beth grits her teeth, her forehead puckered into a
                  tense frown as she begins to sketch.<\/p>\n

                  \/><\/a>\u201cJeans, no heels,\u201d is what Beth says when
                  asked if she\u2019s packed for their upcoming trip to Prague
                  with friends Whitney and Lorna. Beth may as well be called
                  Sidney or Laurie: she is masculinised, her relationship with
                  the female model Axelle is eroticised (Whitney even jokingly
                  refers to Axelle as Beth\u2019s &#8216;girlfriend&#8217;) and
                  it is revealed that Beth keeps her father on an allowance
                  following the death of her wealthy mother.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  Beth and Axelle\u2019s encounters are carefully structured to
                  be titillating, and yet Beth\u2019s sexuality is never openly
                  discussed. Compared to the view of male homosexuality depicted
                  in the first
                  <strong
                    >Hostel<\/strong> film, we\u2019re in full-on homophobic
                    fratboy territory here: lesbians are hot (as long as
                    they\u2019re young, slim and not too gay), and gay men are
                    scary and have to be repressed.<\/p>\n

                      <strong
                        >Hostel II<\/strong> differs to
                        <strong
                          >Hostel<\/strong> in that we get a deeper
                          understanding of how the whole operation works,
                          focalised through two American clients, Todd and
                          Stuart. \u201cThis isn\u2019t like going to a
                          whorehouse,\u201d Todd explains to reluctant Stuart
                          after they successfully bid a collective $100,000 on
                          securing Whitney and Beth as their torture victims.
                          \u201cYou can\u2019t just back out.\u201d<\/p>\n
                          <p>
                            Roth works hard to ensure the viewer feels an iota
                            of sympathy for Stuart: he is de-masculinised by a
                            practical and demanding wife, he lacks charisma, and
                            he has to be cajoled into the Hostel experience by
                            the powerhouse Todd. Todd compares their first kill
                            to losing their virginity; Stuart pensively asks,
                            \u201cDo you think we\u2019re sick?\u201d<\/p>\n
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            \u201cWe\u2019re the normal ones,\u2019 Todd
                            replies, taking a deep sniff of cocaine. As they
                            draw up to the factory, a mournful serenade plays as
                            we see the doubt flicker across Stuart\u2019s face.
                            Roth asks us to feel sympathy for someone who has
                            essentially been peer-pressured into paying vast
                            sums of money to torture a woman \u2013 who
                            intentionally resembles his wife, no less \u2013 to
                            death.<\/p>\n
