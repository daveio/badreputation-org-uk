Diary] What I&#8217;ve Been Playing&#8230; March 2012"},"content":{"rendered":"
<p>
  March was a big one in the world of gaming and not just because of the titles
  that came out. Here in the UK there&#8217;s been other big news that I&#8217;d
  be somewhat remiss not to mention, so please forgive me if I veer slightly
  away from a simple account of what I&#8217;ve been up to. So today I&#8217;ll
  be talking (briefly) about
  <strong
    >Mass Effect 3<\/strong> and the
    <strong
      >Xbox Kinect<\/strong> but I&#8217;ll also wander into the murky world of
      the financial crisis and its impact on gamers cruising the high
      streets.<\/p>\n
      <p>
        First off: the games. \u00a0Obviously there\u2019s
        <strong>
          Mass Effect 3<\/strong>, but as I&#8217;ve mentioned before, there
          will be a full post dedicated to that shortly. \u00a0For now, though,
          I&#8217;ll say that it&#8217;s a great addition to anyone\u2019s
          collection: well-constructed story, superb combat mechanics, good
          graphics and generally an absorbing and engaging universe. \u00a0The
          ending(s) have caused issues among some fans of the franchise, and
          although I shan\u2019t say here what they were or why that is,
          I\u2019ll just say that
          <em
            >I<\/em> had no problem with the way it ended.<\/p>\n

              <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/en-GB\/kinect\"><strong
                >Kinect<\/strong><\/a>. \u00a0I got one at the beginning of
                March and a few little games to go along with it. \u00a0<strong
                  >Kinect Adventures<\/strong> is the title that comes with
                  every single sensor (if you\u2019re buying second-hand, be
                  sure to check!) and it is a simple bit of fun. \u00a0You use
                  your body to complete little challenges on the screen, collect
                  points and progress through various ranks of adventurer.
                  \u00a0It&#8217;s a little bit addictive when you first get the
                  Kinect as it\u2019s all very new and novel and amazing, but in
                  the long run it would probably hold the attention of younger
                  gamers or be best suited to family-centred gaming
                  sessions.<\/p>\n
                  <p>
                    I also got
                    <strong
                      >Kinect Sports<\/strong> (the first game), which proved
                      much more popular between my partner and I. \u00a0You get
                      the option to partake in six different events: Football
                      (Soccer), Bowling (10-pin), Table Tennis, Track &amp;
                      Field (which contains six events in itself), Boxing and
                      Beach Volleyball. \u00a0Again, this is a great bit of fun
                      and you can use it for a spot of exercise as well.
                      \u00a0You can play against four levels of computer
                      opponent, as well as playing against your friends (or with
                      them) online or in the same room. \u00a0You garner points
                      and progress towards Champion status, but really it\u2019s
                      all about the amusement and the potential for collective
                      gaming.<\/p>\n
                      <p>
                        There are another two Kinect games knocking about my
                        living room, but I didn\u2019t want to talk about them
                        as they don\u2019t have the rather pleasing feature
                        I\u2019m about to detail. \u00a0The Kinect games that
                        use your Xbox Avatar in-game (especially in Sports) are
                        also populated with lots of other Avatar people as your
                        opponents or team-mates. \u00a0Now, this may not sound
                        altogether too ground-breaking or interesting, but for
                        me it was quite nice to see a fairly equal mix of
                        &#8211; albeit randomly generated &#8211; Avatars of all
                        descriptions. \u00a0In simpler terms, they aren\u2019t
                        all male. \u00a0Even on team sports that are
                        traditionally &#8216;single sex&#8217; sports (like
                        football) you have men and women of all ages charging
                        about the pitch with you. \u00a0I thought that was a
                        nice little nod &#8211; particularly for games that will
                        have a lot of younger, more impressionable gamers
                        &#8211; just to say \u201cHey, women exist
                        too!\u201d.<\/p>\n

                          <strong
                            >Gamestation<\/strong> (part of the group) has been
                            stripped bare and locked up tight, never to be set
                            foot in again. \u00a0I admit I rarely bought
                            anything from Game or Gamestation, but as the last
                            notable games-only high street chain, it&#8217;s sad
                            to see it fail. \u00a0As a PC gamer at heart, I felt
                            the group had forgotten about me over the years as
                            it focused more on console gamers &#8211; and
                            that\u2019s fair enough if that\u2019s where the
                            money is &#8211; but apparently that didn\u2019t
                            bring in enough revenue to save them.<\/p>\n
                            <p>
                              Things were not helped when
                              <strong
                                >EA<\/strong> refused to supply the group with
                                copies of
                                <strong
                                  >Mass Effect 3<\/strong> on credit and they
                                  had to give everyone who had pre-ordered their
                                  money back. \u00a0Even a few days before they
                                  closed up shop, the Gamestation I usually
                                  wander around was begging for trade-ins of the
                                  title as not a single brand new copy was in
                                  sight. \u00a0I suspect this may have been the
                                  last straw for many customers, but the advent
                                  of the internet worked its evil glory too:
                                  after all, if you can buy a two-week-old title
                                  for \u00a315 on
                                  <strong
                                    >Amazon<\/strong> when it remains \u00a330+
                                    in a high street store, why

                                      >would<\/em> you go that extra mile and
                                      pay more?<\/p>\n
                                      <p>
                                        It is, nevertheless, a little saddening
                                        to see the group suffer the same fate as
                                        many other high street names.
                                        \u00a0Should they remain, in one form or
                                        another, I hope they can take a more
                                        competitive stance on the price war with
                                        the internet and stop pricing themselves
                                        out of the market. <a
