                in English.\u00a0 Before I continue to talk about Ib\u00e1rruri,
                I acknowledge that I&#8217;m a bit of a giddy schoolchild when
                it comes to praising anything Basque in a public sphere and that
                having a Hispanic Studies degree means I take some knowledge for
                granted.\u00a0 So some background information is probably going
                to be pretty useful for you all.<\/p>\n
                <p>
                  The Spanish Civil War began in 1936 when General Francisco
                  Franco led troops in an attempted
                  <em
                    >coup d\u2019\u00e9tat<\/em>\u00a0against the Second
                    Republic. Although the government were caught unawares and
                    significant numbers of Spain\u2019s army were behind Franco,
                    the events of July 1936 turned into a three year civil
                    war.\u00a0 Having written several thousand words on the
                    subject during the course of my degree, I could go into much
                    greater detail but I don\u2019t want to detract from our
                    main focus.\u00a0 Basics to remember: Franco
                    <em

                      Republic was left\/socialist.\u00a0 Now we can move on to
                      our woman of the hour.<\/p>\n

                            borders of the Basque Country in Spain, into a poor
                            mining family.\u00a0 In 1918 she adopted the
                            pseudonym \u2018Pasionaria\u2019 on the publication
                            of an article, highlighting religious hypocrisy,
                            which coincided with Holy Week in a devotedly
                            Catholic country.\u00a0 In 1920 she was appointed as
                            a member of the Provincial Committee of the Basque
                            Communist Party and in 1930 moved up to the Central
                            Committee of the PCE (Communist Party of
                            Spain).\u00a0 In \u201931 she moved to Madrid
                            alongside the formation of the Second Republic and
                            was jailed in September \u201931 for the first in
                            several arrests over the following five
                            years.<\/p>\n
                            <p>
                              There are many amazing things that she did as a
                              prominent pre-war communist woman in politics in
                              Spain, and for a succinct overview of them all I

                              There\u2019s only so much I can say within one
                              article and I want to focus on her wartime
                              contributions to the fight against Franco and
                              fascism.<\/p>\n

                              During the war she was, above all, an astounding
                              orator and a passionate figurehead for the men and
                              women trying desperately to battle Franco\u2019s
                              advances.\u00a0 As a communist she was no stranger
                              to strong retaliations against her speeches and
                              actions, but during the Civil War she became much
                              more than just a voice for communism.\u00a0 She
                              became a central figure for the Republicans trying
                              to push fascism back and defend Spain against
                              Franco.<\/p>\n
