    >A few snapshots of different sorts of feminists, their families and the
    festive season. I&#8217;m fortunate to have lots of lovely people in my
    circle, many of whom identify as feminists, and I was interested in what

              My name is Phopey and I am a 37-year-old black lesbian CP&#8217;d
              (Civil Partnership) mother. I have a keen interest in politics: I
              wanted to be an MP but am re-evaluating that, I think I can be
              more of an agitator on local level! My pet subject at the moment
              is healthcare but it used to be education. I participate in
              healthcare consultancy in three boroughs &#8211; any I can get
              into, I go. I\u2019m learning. I want to understand the policies
              on a local level, rather than having a whip telling me what to
              do.<\/p>\n

                <p>
                  I\u2019ve got church on Christmas Eve, I work with a youth
                  group at my church. We\u2019re doing a modern nativity where
                  carols will be rapped *laughter*. After service we will drive
                  to my partner\u2019s family and we spend Christmas with
                  them.<\/p>\n

                      It\u2019s a tough time. Everything you see is sickly and
                      exaggerated. And so expensive! The essence of what
                      Christmas is about, love and giving, is lost. I made my
                      daughter make Christmas cards this year for friends and
                      family.<\/p>\n

                      When I thought about books, she had to have books \u2013 I
                      don\u2019t understand those children who just have toys.
                      My daughter has her own books on a shelf in the lounge, at
                      her eye level. So if I want a book for her, I have to bend
                      down. It\u2019s about language and communicating at her
                      level, not mine. Right now, the important things are about
                      her adjusting to what her world is like, but to be a
                      successful person.<\/p>\n

                      I\u2019ve got a book about two gay swans who fall in love,
                      I\u2019ve got another that\u2019s about a girl who is
                      mixed race and brought up by her grandmother so she can
                      understand different family make-ups. I have got one
                      princess book but it\u2019s about a pig that\u2019s doing

                              <p>
                                I start from an educational basis. When I needed
                                her to understand colour, I bought a psychedelic
                                toy. I like toys to be natural and sustainable,
                                I hate plastic toys. If possible someone has
                                given them to us, I like them to have that
                                spirit of love. That\u2019s important to me.
                                Every toy I get is about stretching her skills:
                                it\u2019s not about something that she can do
                                already.<\/p>\n
                              </p>

                                I have got her a dolls house, but I haven\u2019t
                                got traditional figures in it. My
                                partner&#8217;s father made it and we chose the
                                colours for the rooms together. She has a Sindy
                                doll that lives in there, called Princess. Her
                                Russian princess doll lives in there as well.
                                The figures that live in there are
                                non-traditional. She doesn\u2019t own mum and
                                dad dolls.<\/p>\n

                                I don\u2019t do Lego \u2013 I don\u2019t
                                understand why children build something to
                                destroy it \u2013 if someone has any thoughts on
                                that let me know! *laughs* I don\u2019t do baby
                                dolls and prams. That is the oldest game in the
                                world \u2013 the oldest toy in the world is a
                                baby doll. The first game a child plays is to
                                roleplay their mother. Says a lot about our
                                responsibility, if the mother gets it wrong,
                                that\u2019s diabolical.<\/p>\n

                                    My partner is blonde with blue eyes. The
                                    donor is American Indian and Black American

                                    *laughs* I chose that. Because I\u2019m

                                      child. I\u2019d have to get donor sperm
                                      anyway. I watched a programme about
                                      surrogates and thought we could do that
                                      without giving the child back. We went to
                                      Harley Street and a very expensive time
                                      later she was born. I\u2019ve got to make
                                      sure that everything around her is
                                      ordinary but unique.<\/p>\n

                                            I felt the pressure to normalise. I
                                            gave in to society&#8217;s pressure
                                            that she\u2019s meant to eat all
                                            these sweet disgusting things. For
                                            the first two years she only ate
                                            things I made. I\u2019ve also had
                                            people pressure me to
                                            <em

                                              made: that she was such a mix.
                                              Because of British law, my partner
                                              had to formally adopt her, I have
                                              the rights over her, because I
                                              gave birth. Which is obviously an
                                              emotional trauma for my wife. Any
                                              legal moment I have to hand over
                                              my rights as a mother. But

                                                    so toys are about that. Even

                                                    prams! None of the toys
                                                    really build on that.
