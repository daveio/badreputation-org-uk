  On 10 March 1914, suffragette Mary Richardson attacked Velasquez&#8217;
  &#8216;Rokeby&#8217; Venus with &#8216;a long narrow blade&#8217; as it hung
  in the National Gallery. She stated that she had &#8216;tried to destroy the
  picture of the most beautiful woman in mythological history as a protest
  against the Government for destroying Mrs Pankhurst&#8217;. Emmeline Pankhurst

  In this rather hilarious <a title=\"National Gallery Outrage\"
  href=\"http:\/\/www.heretical.com\/suffrage\/1914tms2.html\"
  target=\"_blank\">report of the incident <\/a>in the
  <strong
    >Times<\/strong>, the attack on the painting is described in almost human
    terms: &#8216;probably the most serious blow has caused a cruel wound in the
    neck&#8217;; there is &#8216;a broad laceration starting near the left
    shoulder&#8217; and &#8216;other cuts [&#8230;] cleanly made in the region
    of the waist&#8217;. The Keeper of the National Gallery, meanwhile,
    describes &#8216;seven distinct injuries&#8217; and &#8216;a ragged
    bruise&#8217; on the painting, in the language of a post-mortem.<\/p>\n
    <p>
      Meanwhile, &#8216;prominent woman suffragist Mary Richardson&#8217; (note
      that the noun there is &#8216;suffragist&#8217;, not &#8216;woman&#8217;)
      is said to have used an instrument &#8216;similar to [those] used by
      butchers&#8217; &#8211; as if that somehow makes it worse than if
      she&#8217;d used sewing scissors or a hat pin. Clearly the writer
      considers the Venus as much of a piece of meat (albeit a sacred one) as
      Mary Richardson &#8211; who later said she &#8216;couldn&#8217;t stand the
      way the men visitors gawped at it&#8217;.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      The
      <strong
        >Times<\/strong> counters by saying that this Venus is &#8216;absolutely
        natural and absolutely pure&#8217; &#8211; \u00a0a strange claim that
        implicitly contrasts this &#8216;marvellously graceful&#8217; women with
        the &#8216;woman suffragist&#8217; who attacks her, in the process
        making this about much more than the destruction of art.<\/p>\n

              There&#8217;s a whole room devoted to women (after several
              focusing on those other Wanton Destroyers of Art, the Protestants
              and the Irish), with accompanying hand-wringing notation:<\/p>\n
              <blockquote>
                <p>
                  In 1913 and 1914 the campaign to win women the vote became
                  more militant and turned from window-smashing to attacks on
                  art. Paintings in public museums and galleries &#8211; the
                  nation&#8217;s cultural heritage &#8211; were attacked in
                  order to effect to effect political change. \u00a0The militant
                  women who carried out these acts of iconoclasm did so in the

                  It&#8217;s couched in the language of facts and neutrality but
                  there&#8217;s a nasty undercurrent to the emphasis on
                  &#8216;<em
                    >public\u00a0<\/em>museums and galleries&#8217; and the

                    nations&#8217;s cultural heritage&#8217; (to which we will
                    return).\u00a0Together with the repetition of
                    &#8216;militant&#8217; and the rising pitch of hysteria in
                    the movement &#8216;from window-smashing to attacks on
                    art&#8217;, it&#8217;s clear that the writer is no friend to

                    <p>
                      &#8216;Iconoclasm&#8217; is, of course, the term used in
                      the exhibition as a whole, although I find its application
                      to the Rokeby Venus little better than the
                      <strong
                        >Times<\/strong>&#8216; assertion that the painting is
                        &#8216;universally recognised by good judges as
                        [&#8230;a] masterpiece&#8217; &#8211; it implicitly
                        speaks from the perspective of a white, male, artistic
                        elite, which has confirmed that this painting is
                        &#8216;objectively&#8217; of almost religious
                        (&#8216;iconic&#8217;) importance. In the process, the
                        word comes close to justifying Richardson&#8217;s claim
                        that an &#8216;outcry against my deed [&#8230;]\u00a0is
                        an hypocrisy so long as they allow the destruction of
                        Mrs. Pankhurst and other beautiful living women&#8217;
                        &#8211; the elite cared more for a painted woman than a
                        living one.<\/p>\n
                        <p>
                          Interestingly, that very\u00a0perspective appears once
                          again in the next room, where we have Carl
                          Andre&#8217;s\u00a0<a title=\"Carl Andre - Bricks\"
                          href=\"http:\/\/www.tate.org.uk\/art\/artworks\/andre-equivalent-viii-t01534\/text-catalogue-entry\"

                          display. This was\u00a0attacked by a member of the
                          public who resented his taxes being spent to acquire
                          it for Tate because it wasn&#8217;t
                          &#8216;proper&#8217; art. Whatever you think about the
                          piece, you can see his point. Yet today, we are told
                          in the gallery notes, &#8216;Carl Andre&#8217;s
                          sculpture remains admired by some and misunderstood by
                          others&#8217;.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_14107\"

                            <p>
                              The National Gallery &#8211; where the Venus was
                              hanging in 1914 &#8211; was set up in 1824 to
                              provide a space for the poor to view art alongside
                              their social betters. In its original conception,
                              there was a moral reform impetus behind it &#8211;
                              many spoke of how museums accessible to the
                              broader public would reduce birth rates and crime
                              among the poor (who would now have a gallery to go
                              to instead!), and there was talk of how, through
                              exposure to their &#8216;betters&#8217; &#8211;
                              including middle-class women, for whom the gallery
                              offered a genteel and &#8216;safe&#8217; public
                              space &#8211; the working classes would learn to
                              regulate their passions and behave in a more
                              orderly (quasi-middle-class) manner. In fact,
                              national galleries &#8211; set up throughout
                              Europe during the nineteenth century &#8211; were
                              described as instruments in which to learn better
                              citizenship.<\/p>\n
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              You know the punchline, right? Yup &#8211; the
                              majority of the people museums were trying to
                              entice in and train up as model citizens &#8211;
                              working class men, all women &#8211; did not have
                              the vote. That&#8217;s the problem. These works
                              may have been the &#8216;nation&#8217;s cultural
                              heritage&#8217;, but the nation in question was an
                              incomplete one. The Rokeby Venus didn&#8217;t
                              belong to the Suffragettes. It belonged to
                              art-loving, nude-gawping middle-class men.<\/p>\n

                              The most interesting thing in this exhibition, for
                              me, is the admission in the Suffragette room that
                              the Suffragettes prompted as much
                              &#8216;iconoclasm&#8217; as they enacted. A WSPU
                              pamphlet is exhibited on which Mrs
                              Pankhurst&#8217;s face has been so violently
                              &#8216;de-faced&#8217; the paper has torn,
                              exposing the words on the next page. In this age
                              of Caroline Criado-Perez and Anita Sarkeesian,
                              that should make us think.<\/p>\n<div
