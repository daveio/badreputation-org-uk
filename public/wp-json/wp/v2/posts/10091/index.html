  Last year we marked <a

  Day<\/a> with <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/2011\/03\/08\/bring-back-the-parade\/\">a
  personal post<\/a> from a team member who talked about living and working in
  countries where it is, or has been, celebrated in different ways.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  This year I asked some of the team to give a shout-out to a relevant project,
  organisation or intiative.<\/p>\n<div style=\"width: 510px\"

    >Sarah J: <\/strong> I&#8217;m being a bit cheeky and flagging up something
    that the charity I work for are doing for International Women&#8217;s Day.
    Womankind Worldwide is hosting a virtual march around the globe to celebrate
    the international women&#8217;s movement, raise awareness of the incredible
    work our partners do and remind feminists in the UK that we&#8217;re part of
    a powerful, global force for change.<\/p>\n
    <p>
      We\u2019ve added an interactive map of the world to our website, with a
      counter showing how far the march has travelled around the world and how
      many people have taken part. For everyone that signs up the marker moves
      10 miles forward. We need about 2,500 people to get all the way
      round!<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Please stop by <a
      href=\"www.womankind.org.uk\/world\">www.womankind.org.uk\/world<\/a> to
      join the march, and show our partners working for women\u2019s rights in
      Africa, Asia and Latin America that you are with them. You can also leave
      a message of support for the activists we work with on <a
      href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/womankind\">our Facebook page<\/a> or by
      sending us a tweet (<a
      href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/woman_kind\">@woman_kind<\/a>) &#8211;
      we will pass all of them on.<\/p>\n

        href=\"http:\/\/joinmeonthebridge.org\/profile\/WomenforWomenInternational\">JOIN
        ME ON THE BRIDGE<\/a>! On 8th March, <a
        href=\"http:\/\/joinmeonthebridge.org\/profile\/WomenforWomenInternational\"
        target=\"_blank\">Women for Women International<\/a> are asking you to
        join them on the bridge. All kinds of bridges. All around the UK
        (there&#8217;s a <a href=\"http:\/\/joinmeonthebridge.org\/events\"
        target=\"_blank\">list of events here<\/a>). Why bridges? Well,
        it&#8217;s about building bridges &#8211; geddit? &#8211; and
        proclaiming messages of peace. They are inviting everyone to come and
        participate or register their own event. I love events like this that
        reach out across the whole world and make connections. As well as events
        structured around a good pun.<\/p>\n
        <p>
          The key thing for me here is that S word, solidarity. I often rail
          against the idea that all women need to do such-and-such a thing
          because they are women or assigned-female-bodied, cos that&#8217;s,
          you know, sexist. But that people &#8211; of whatever shape or gender
          &#8211; could get together and show support for women around the
          world, for a couple of hours, at least? That&#8217;s drawing attention
          to inequality. And as they&#8217;ve put it on their Mission Statement:
          &#8220;On International Women&#8217;s Day, 8 March, thousands of
          people will show that they are with the women of Afghanistan, Iraq,
          Congo, Rwanda, South Sudan and other war-torn
          countries.&#8221;.<\/p>\n

        <p>
          <strong
            >Hannah:<\/strong> The organisation I&#8217;d like to give a big
            shout-out to is <a
            href=\"http:\/\/www.southallblacksisters.org.uk\/\">Southall Black
            Sisters<\/a>, an organisation by and for Black and Asian women which
            began in 1979 in the aftermath of the death of Blair Peach (an
            anti-facist protestor who died from police violence). Since then SBS
            has changed and expanded its remit to fit the needs of those around
            it &#8211; specifically as advocates of womens&#8217; rights,
            supporting women suffering from domestic violence and campaigning
            against religious fundamentalism. The role of SBS as a support group
            especially for ethnic minority women is especially important as
            women of colour often face different pressures (see their forced
            marriages campaign) and specialised services are needed.<\/p>\n
            <p>
              Southall Black Sisters first came to my attention at a London
              Feminist Network meeting in 2010 and they&#8217;re regulars at
              Fawcett Society gatherings and marches, too. Their speakers have
              always been bright, warm, engaging and utterly unwavering in their
              points, unfazed by the battles they have ahead. Working at
              grassroots level, the SBS have their fingers on the pulse and
              report to people in power &#8211; they have been invited to speak
              at the Home Office and the UN.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2007 SBS faced funding cuts from Ealing Council which would
              have closed all SBS&#8217;s operations. The council claimed argued
              that their services were no longer necessary due to &#8216;Social
              Cohesion&#8217; &#8211; SBS fought this in the high court citing
              the Race Relations Act and their victory has set a legal precedent
              for other ethnic minority support groups facing cuts &#8211; an
              especially important victory as so many charities and support
              networks are squeezed and so many women and ethnic minorities feel
              the force of the cuts deeper them others.<\/p>\n

            <p>
              <strong
                >Me (Miranda):<\/strong> Following on from that, I&#8217;m gonna
                get on my political crate for a moment here too and mention that
                International Women&#8217;s Day has its roots in socialism. It
                was founded by <a
                href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Clara_Zetkin\">Clara
                Zetkin<\/a> under the name International Working Women&#8217;s
                Day. It came from the labour movements at the turn of the
                twentieth century, and in a year when government cuts have put
                women at a <a
                href=\"http:\/\/fawcettsociety.org.uk\/index.asp?PageID=1264\">twenty-five
                year high for unemployment figures<\/a>, I think this is
                something that it pays to bear in mind. Opposing these cuts
                &#8211; to our NHS, to our jobs, to our libraries, to our
                working lives &#8211; is vital as far as I&#8217;m concerned
                because they
                <em
                  >enforce and underline systemic inequalities<\/em> and limit
                  our power to do something about them. Denise Marshall <a

                  <p>
                    All of which is to say: nope, Dave, SHAN&#8217;T &#8220;calm
                    down, dear&#8221; and my recommended Thing I Am Doing is
                    probably &#8220;yelling at Parliament about these cuts at
                    every possible opportunity&#8221; because I believe that
                    absolutely is a feminist issue &#8211; the NHS for example
                    is a major employer of women, of whom I am one, aside from
                    the obvious issue of service cuts! In terms of being more
                    specifically-IWD, there&#8217;s also the <a

                    Centre<\/a>, and as has been well documented, I really dig

                                                with a personal post from a team
                                                member who talked about living
                                                and working in countries where
