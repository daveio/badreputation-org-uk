  I love this cartoon. I sent it to nearly all the women I know last year. Do I
  need to say why I love it? It so clearly outlines the choices for young girls
  these days, not just at Halloween. You can be anything you want to be, as long
  as you&#8217;re sexy. You can be anything, as long as you look good doing it.
  Anything!! As long as some man somewhere thinks it&#8217;s sexy&#8230;<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  I mean, the first thing people say about women they&#8217;re trying to insult
  is usually that they&#8217;re ugly\/fat\/too old. That they don&#8217;t
  possess or inspire this all-important male approval. Just think about some of
  the things you&#8217;ve heard said, by the left
  <em
    >and<\/em> the right, about female politicians. Think about some of the
    things
    <em
      >you<\/em> might have said.<\/p>\n
      <p>
        When men shout or whistle at me in the street and I walk away, what do
        they shout? They shout &#8220;You fat cow!&#8221; &#8220;You ugly
        bitch!&#8221; They&#8217;re not alone, every five year-old kid starting
        school learns that they can upset little girls by calling them
        fat.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course you can also be
        <em
          >too<\/em> sexy, because hey, you wouldn&#8217;t want those people
          you&#8217;re trying to get the approval of thinking you&#8217;re
          <em
            >easy<\/em> now, would ya? That could interfere with your appeal.
            But it&#8217;s all related. Be
            <em
              >just<\/em> sexy enough, show
              <em
                >just<\/em> the right amount of skin, look just submissive
                enough, just powerful enough, don&#8217;t look like you&#8217;re
                &#8216;asking for it&#8217; (whatever
                <em
                  >the fuck<\/em> that means), give that camera
                  <em
                    >just the right look,<\/em> and you too can be anything you
                    want to be.<\/p>\n
                    <p>
                      To get off the soapbox and back to the subject, Halloween,
                      this day which just highlights something that&#8217;s
