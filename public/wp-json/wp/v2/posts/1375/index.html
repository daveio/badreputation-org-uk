  \/><\/a>Hands up everyone who had crappy sex education at school. You know
  &#8211; where you learnt about the tubes and the hormones, watched a video of
  someone giving birth and then a teacher put a condom on a banana and you were
  sent on your way. Maybe they also told you to wait til you were married, or
  you were 21, whichever came first. Hands up &#8211; yes, I thought so.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  Mine was pretty similar (aside from one teacher telling us that an orgasm was
  like a really good sneeze\u2026 no, I don\u2019t know either). Relationships
  and feelings and other relevant things weren&#8217;t discussed, and neither
  was abortion, despite the girl I sat next to in design tech having had one
  just the year before.<\/p>\n
</p>
<h3>
  <strong
    >The A Word<\/strong><\/h3>\n
    <p>
      In a way, I am relieved. Because I have seen some of the <a title=\"The
      Guardian - Shock tactics\"
      href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/education\/2008\/nov\/25\/anti-abortion-schools\"
      target=\"_self\">materials<\/a> used to discuss abortion in schools all
      over the country, and they make my blood run cold. Most of it is little
      better than anti-choice propaganda, and much of it is simply untrue.
      Abortion makes you infertile, abortion gives you breast cancer&#8230;
      These lies are imparted to young people at the hands of abortion
      &#8216;experts&#8217; who are invited into schools, often by well-meaning
      teachers desperate for guidance on how best to handle &#8216;the A
      word&#8217;. Young people deserve better than this.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      The problem goes far deeper than the curriculum, of course. Abortion
      happens, whether it is legal or not, safe or not, all over the world.
      Globally, about 1 in 5 pregnancies end in abortion (some <a
      title=\"Guttmacher Institute\"
      href=\"http:\/\/www.guttmacher.org\/pubs\/fb_IAW.html\"
      target=\"_self\">global <\/a>and <a title=\"Education for Choice\"
      href=\"http:\/\/www.efc.org.uk\/Foryoungpeople\/Factsaboutabortion\/Statistics\"
      target=\"_self\">local<\/a> stats). Reluctance to discuss abortion openly
      and truthfully in the media and in popular culture is doing untold damage
      to individuals and to women&#8217;s precious right to choose. How are
      teachers and youth workers meant to offer unbiased information and support
      if they themselves have never had the chance to have an open discussion?
      To hear the facts?<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <h3>
      <strong
        >Secrets and lies<\/strong><\/h3>\n
        <p>
          Refusing to tackle the subject of abortion allows stigma to flourish,
          putting young people facing unplanned pregnancy in a position where
          they may not even feel able to ask for help. Scaring young women into
          carrying an unwanted pregnancy to term benefits no one.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          But no matter, right? There\u2019s plenty of information freely
          available, and countless support and counselling services. So
          here\u2019s a fun game: why not google \u2018pregnancy
          counselling\u2019 and let me know how many of those first page results
          you reckon are really offering unbiased information? If you find any
          really choice quotes please comment and share!<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <h3>
          <strong
            >Freedom to choose<\/strong><\/h3>\n
            <p>
              I\u2019m not assuming all BadRep\u2019s readers are pro-choice,
              but I\u2019m sure there are some of you. Perhaps, like me,
              you\u2019ve waved a placard or shouted into a megaphone for a
              woman\u2019s right to choose and to control her own body.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              Standing up for safe, legal abortion is vital, as there are plenty
              of people who will take any opportunity they can to turn the clock
              back on reproductive freedom. Some of them are sitting in
              Westminster right now, deciding your future. (That\u2019s a nice
              thought, isn\u2019t it?)<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              But the war is also being waged quietly and efficiently on another
              front, in our classrooms and in a host of so-called counselling
              clinics. It\u2019s up to us to expose the propagandists and arm
              young people with the facts so that they can make their own
              decisions.<\/p>\n
