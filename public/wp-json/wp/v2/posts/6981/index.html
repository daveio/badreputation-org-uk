    >WARNING: CONTAINS LOTS OF SPOILERS &#8211; SORRY!<\/strong><\/p>\n
    <p>
      I&#8217;ll admit, in the wake of previous supposedly Made For Sarah-style
      films being crushing disappointments (no, I&#8217;m still not talking to
      you, Zack Snyder, after <a
      href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/2011\/04\/06\/at-the-movies-sucker-punch\/\">The
      Incident<\/a>), I was readying myself for another angry rant in the
      general direction of the internet. I went into
      <strong
        >Cowboys and Aliens<\/strong> with low hopes: I wanted cowboys, and I
        wanted aliens. I got them and they were great.<\/p>\n
        <p>
          The cowboy film has always been an exploration of maleness &#8211;
          often specifically white American maleness &#8211; pitching
          &#8220;good&#8221; masculinity (cowboys) versus &#8220;bad&#8221;
          (indians and bandits). There&#8217;s often an additional trope which
          sets masculinity against the untamed natural environment.
          Alien\/monster films focus on our fear of &#8220;others&#8221; and
          &#8220;outsiders&#8221; that we cannot understand or control. Often
          that other is a frightening idea in our midst, like in <a
          href=\"http:\/\/www.d-9.com\/\"><strong
            >District 9<\/strong><\/a> (post-colonial or immigration-related
            concerns), or <a

                  masculinity does in the face of &#8220;the other&#8221;.
                  Without referencing anything, we can probably conclude that it
                  shoots at it. This is very true.<\/p>\n
                  <p>Except&#8230;<\/p>\n</p>
                  <p>
                    &#8230; The casting of
                    <strong
                      >Daniel Craig<\/strong> AKA that most English of
                      Englishmen, James Bond, as the lead in this action romp
                      seems a little out of kilter. His physical masculinity is
                      present &#8211; of this we are in no doubt &#8211; but
                      there are nice little moments in which traditional tropes
                      of agressive masculinity are turned slightly around such
                      as the focus on groups, teams and families succeeding
                      rather than the usual &#8220;one man against the
                      world&#8221;.<\/p>\n
                      <p>
                        I am probably going into too much analysis for what is
                        overall a pleasing action romp. The full spoiler-tastic
                        plot can be found <a

                        cowboys, some aliens, stuff explodes. Daniel Craig takes
                        his shirt off quite a bit,

                                  that the orignal public outing for this was in

                                  book format<\/a> from an idea by Scott
                                  Rosenberg, who took a long time to actually
                                  sell the concept as a film. No idea why it was
                                  such a hard sell; <a

                                  The film works. I sat, rapt, as the spectacle
                                  unfolded. And spectacle is the right word
                                  &#8211; action films are about watching Stuff
                                  Happening Then Exploding but with enough
                                  interesting character and plot elements to
                                  lead you through it, without distracting from
                                  the important explosions. Otherwise
                                  we&#8217;ll just be watching a Michael Bay
                                  film.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_6982\"

                                  A female gunslinger, albeit from very, very
                                  far out of town, is certainly a very welcome
                                  presence. I&#8217;m still in two minds over
                                  how I feel about that. It&#8217;s good to get
                                  female characters into what is usually a very
                                  male-dominated genre. Cowboy films are pretty
                                  much just that &#8211; about cowBOYS.<\/p>\n

                                  So let&#8217;s look at the boys &#8211;
                                  there&#8217;s a lot of discussion of
                                  &#8220;being a man&#8221; in the film, and the
                                  male characters all come of age in different
                                  ways, usually through their relationship to
                                  each other as father\/son types or in their
                                  relationship to guns and how big they are.
                                  Paging Dr Freud, anyone? As an analysis of
                                  maleness it&#8217;s not the most

                                    subtle at all. The aliens are evil and very
                                    &#8220;alien&#8221; &#8211; they have no
                                    characterisation and are just the enemy

                                    (geddit?). The &#8220;baddie&#8221; of the
                                    film is very clearly avarice.
                                    Almost\u00a0every act of plunder is directly
                                    and swiftly punished. The &#8220;good&#8221;
                                    characters are those that express noble

                                      &#8211; criminals and lawmen, cowboys and
                                      indians, Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford
                                      who have a couple of amusing
                                      testosterone-offs during the film &#8211;
                                      in order to fight the common enemy. Now,
                                      all of this, well-handled, would be corny
                                      but more than good enough for what is
                                      essentially a Spaghetti Western crossed
                                      with

                                            Talking about masculinity and how it
                                            is handled in films should be as
                                            important for feminists as counting
                                            female characters and their agency.
                                            Speaking of which, I was pleased to
                                            note that the female lead
                                            didn&#8217;t need rescuing any more
                                            times than Daniel Craig, and
                                            she&#8217;s the only one who knows
                                            what&#8217;s going on, plus she
                                            actually saves the day in the
                                            end.<\/p>\n

                                            However, there are precious few
                                            other female characters, as is the
                                            sad case with Westerns &#8211; when
                                            will we get more cowgirls, when? The
                                            only other speaking female
                                            characters are a prostitute and a
                                            wife, both of whom are damsels
                                            eventually in distress. It would
                                            have been nice for there to be a
                                            human heroine for Craig&#8217;s
                                            character to riff off (to quote the
                                            person I went to the cinema with,
                                            &#8220;I knew she was too beautiful
                                            to be real!&#8221;) rather than a
                                            space alien on a mission of
                                            vengeance. Though maybe she was
                                            still a female space alien.
                                            I&#8217;m choosing to believe she
                                            was.<\/p>\n

                                            Another lump in the plot stew is the
                                            presentation of the Native American
                                            characters- the usual
                                            &#8220;other&#8221; to the cowboy,
                                            replaced in this film by the aliens.
                                            They team up with the cowboys to
                                            Save The Day &#8211; and frankly,
                                            there is a lot of schmaltz and hokum
                                            surrounding the entire thing, from
                                            their mystical powers that help
                                            Daniel Craig&#8217;s amnesiac
                                            character remember crucial plot
                                            points to the fact that Harrison
                                            Ford grows as a person by realising
                                            his &#8220;adopted&#8221; Native
                                            American son is better than his
                                            current one&#8230; just before he
                                            dies in his arms.<\/p>\n

                                            So it&#8217;s a film that
                                            stereotypes men, women, cowboys and
                                            indians. It probably stereotypes the
                                            aliens too, but they don&#8217;t
                                            actually speak so much as growl so
                                            it&#8217;s hard to tell. It&#8217;s
                                            silly, it&#8217;s schmaltzy&#8230;
                                            but that&#8217;s also why it&#8217;s
                                            fun. This film does not take itself
                                            seriously, and I liked that. <a
