      Last week, Paul Cornell (comics, TV and novel writer) stated that, in a
      bid to get more equal gender representation on Science Fiction and Fantasy
      convention panels, he was going to <a
      href=\"http:\/\/www.paulcornell.com\/2012\/02\/panel-parity.html\">stand
      down from any panel that wasn\u2019t 50\/50 or near as and invite a woman
      to take his place<\/a>.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Cue an awesome shitstorm of vitriol and support. The main thrust of some
      feminists&#8217; arguments I&#8217;ve heard against this, and in some
      cases against Paul personally, is that this was ego boosting,
      man-on-a-white-horse, mansplaining wank and we don\u2019t need it.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Sorry, sisters, but we do. Let\u2019s take a look at the arguments.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >1. &#8216;This looks like it\u2019s a man to the rescue of women,
        showing us in a submissive and passive light, needing us to be thrust
        into the spotlight by a man with agency.&#8217;<\/strong><\/p>\n
        <p>
          Um, yes. You know why? Because sexism has been so ingrained in SFF
          over the years, back when it was a male-dominated genre, this is
          actually our starting point. Editors get fewer submissions from women
          regarding horror, fantasy and hard SF, the subgenres that are often
          most applauded by critics (also mostly male). Publishers put fewer
          women forward for convention guest spots, and female authors
          themselves look at the gender make-up of panels and step back. I think
          women haven\u2019t stood up en masse to rectify this because it became
          the norm. We told ourselves \u2018SFF is sexist, so they don\u2019t
          notice women\u2019 and forgot that arguably &#8211; especially when
          you take account of urban fantasy and paranormal romance &#8211; there
          are more of us in the genre, and hey, we sell more copies. We have as
          much right to be at those cons, doing those signings, making our
          voices heard, as the feted men do. SFF convention organisers have
          shoved women on all-women panels, told us to talk about &#8216;women
          in SFF&#8217; and then told us that\u2019s the debate and equality
          will shake out of that. It won\u2019t. I think, somewhere along the
          way, we forgot to band together and tell SFF and con organisers to go
          shove their sexism. Maybe this will help.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong
            >2. &#8216;We don\u2019t need no man sorting this out for
            us.&#8217;<\/strong><\/p>\n
            <p>
              See above. We do. It sucks. That\u2019s the frikkin\u2019 point.
              SFF wasn\u2019t listening when we were raising our voices. I wish,
              I fervently wish, that when a woman makes a point about gender
              inequality, it wasn\u2019t explained away as being a
              &#8216;women\u2019s issue&#8217; and therefore marginal and easy
              to ignore. It shouldn\u2019t be. This is about equality &#8211;
              which affects you, regardless of gender. Yes, it sucks that the
              world takes notice when a man does something. No, it
              shouldn\u2019t be this way. But it is. And maybe, just maybe, if
              we join hands and do this thing together without drawing gender
              lines ourselves, in a few years, it won\u2019t be this way
              anymore.<\/p>\n

                also-ran, putting her immediately as a runner-up to the man
                stepping down for her.&#8217;<\/strong><\/p>\n

                  align=\"left\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/>Yes, it does. And I
                  think this does mean that Paul may have to change his
                  approach, perhaps so that he and other people (male or female,
                  it\u2019s 50\/50 for all) ask the con organisers to disclose
                  the gender balance of the panels they are being invited on,
                  and then, if it\u2019s out of whack, suggest another male (or
                  female) author to readdress the balance. This way, your fans
                  still get to see you on a balanced panel elsewhere at the
                  convention, and there doesn\u2019t have to be any theatre or
                  drawing of attention to an act of substitution.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  But, and I want to be really clear about this, just because
                  Paul suggested something that isn\u2019t 100% ideal for women,
                  doesn\u2019t mean we have to throw out the entire idea. The
                  theory is good; we just have to look at the best way of
                  putting it into practice. We don\u2019t need to get into an
                  uproar because the first suggestion wasn\u2019t the best
                  approach \u2013 it\u2019s not carved in stone.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  My point is: this is a starting point. We\u2019re gonna have
                  to be big girls and suck up some of the stuff we don\u2019t
                  like to help make a change that we desperately want. We have
                  to be pragmatic and proactive, because the status quo
                  wasn\u2019t changing with us doing nothing or shouting about
                  it in forums and on blogs. We shouldn\u2019t be jumping on
                  this suggestion and saying it\u2019s all tosh because it can
                  be seen as patronising \u2013 can we please get past that and
                  look at how the entire situation that this is trying to fight
                  against is worse?<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  Paul\u2019s proposal may not be perfect. But out of it is
                  growing a <a
                  href=\"http:\/\/www.fiftyfiftyfestivals.co.uk\/\">50\/50
                  movement<\/a> that a lot of women and men are getting behind.
                  We\u2019re asking people to talk to cons to check out their
                  gender balance before they say yes. We\u2019re asking women to
                  promote themselves more. We\u2019re asking readers to look at
                  their shelves and see if they read mostly female or male
                  authors, and to try adding a different gender to the shopping
                  cart next time they buy books. I\u2019m hoping that feminists
                  can look at the big picture here and see that we are
                  struggling to bring visible equality to SFF \u2013 and that
                  along the way, we\u2019re going to need equal input from all
                  genders to do it.<\/p>\n
