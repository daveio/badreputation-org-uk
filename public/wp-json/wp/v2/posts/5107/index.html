  On the morning of the Royal Wedding, the street outside BadRep Towers was
  <em
    >saturated<\/em> with grown women wearing plastic tiaras. Rob and I became
    vaguely concerned we might get turned into pumpkins or something, and
    decided to take refuge in the (weirdly, wonderfully empty) British Museum
    for the day to regain a sense of perspective. <\/p>\n
    <p>
      But it seems we&#8217;re all in the pink plastic grip of fantasy
      princesshood, so I&#8217;ve decided to give in for a moment and take a
      look at some fairytale-themed pop music &#8211; but with a little bit of
      smarts and sass thrown in. Songs that turn tropes upside down or inside
      out, or give the princesses unexpected vigourous voice. In this
      post-<strong
        >Shrek<\/strong> epoch we&#8217;re living in, it&#8217;s a pretty
        well-travelled road, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it isn&#8217;t fun.

            Moment<\/a>, which this post is intended as a sort of humorous
            companion to. It&#8217;s not really an Order of Preference so much
            as a Pile of Stuff, because I&#8217;m not in the mood today to be
            ranking things in a heirarchy. A Pile of Stuff is way better.
