              American Horror Story is SEXY. It emanates sweet tendrils of
              hotness, wisps of decadent, lustful sexual deviance and sultry
              taboo, while trotting apace through a veritable phalanx of horror
              tropes and borrowing heavily from the classics of the genre. I
              love it. It is also, in the words of the hilarious <a

                        anti-abortionism and the exploitative male gaze. And
