          data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/a>Despite the list of titles above,
          Pastre herself refuses any simple political identity, declaring
          &#8220;Je ne suis pas une activiste. Je suis po\u00e9te et
          danseuse&#8221; (I am not an activist. I am a poet and a dancer).
          Nevertheless, she has also been a journalist, radio broadcaster,
          publisher, mime artist and theatre director.<\/p>\n
          <p>
            Pastre&#8217;s coming-out, at the age of 56, followed successful
            careers as an academic, theatre practitioner and poet. Born in <a
            href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mainz#20th_century\">French-occupied
            Mainz<\/a> after the First World War, Pastre was educated at the <a
            href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sorbonne\">Sorbonne<\/a>,
            then became a high school teacher. While in Paris, Pastre studied
            mime with <a
            href=\"http:\/\/www.marcelmarceau.com\/bio.html\">Marcel
            Marceau<\/a> and <a
            href=\"http:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/arts-entertainment\/obituary-jacques-lecoq-1076692.html\">Jacques
            Lecoq<\/a>; between 1960 and 1976, Pastre also directed a theatre
            troupe, which would eventually take her name: Compagnie
            Genevi\u00e8ve Pastre.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            It was during her time as a director that Pastre began gaining
            recognition as a poet, subsequently publishing ten poetry
            collections between 1972 and 2005. In 1976, having privately begun
            to live with a woman, she began agitating for lesbian rights in
            France. Her official coming-out was a declaration in print: the 1980
            essay on female sexuality,
            <strong
              >De L&#8217;Amour lesbien<\/strong> (<em
                >About Lesbian Love<\/em>).<\/p>\n
                <p>
                  By 2000, Pastre had published a further five books, including
                  historical works. As the titles of
                  <strong
                    >Homosexuality in the Ancient World<\/strong> and
                    <strong
                      >Athens and the Sapphic Peril<\/strong> suggest, Pastre
                      was one of the first feminist theorists to deconstruct
                      classical myths. Challenging the dominance of
                      Foucault&#8217;s
                      <strong
                        >History of Sexuality<\/strong>, she argued that
                        Foucault &#8211; and with him the male academy &#8211;
                        had misinterpreted both ancient languages and lesbian
                        sexuality.<\/p>\n

                          contribution, however, has undoubtedly been to the
                          transformation of queer rights, and thus queer life,
                          in France. A year before coming out in the pages of

                              the smaller, disparate French gay rights groups
                              that already existed &#8211; including David et

                              Jews) &#8211; CUARH organised a massive protest on
                              4th April 1981. 10,000 French LGBT people and
                              allies joined what has since been recognised as
                              France&#8217;s first ever gay rights march,
                              campaigning for homosexual sex (decriminalised
                              since the French revolution) to have the same age
                              of consent as for heterosexuals.<\/p>\n
                              <p>
                                Such was the strength of the CUARH protest that
                                a few days later, the French president,
                                Mitterrand, pledged to fulfil their demands. In
                                1982, Genevi\u00e8ve Pastre organised, with
                                CUARH, France&#8217;s first ever Gay Pride
                                celebrations; the organisation went on to fight
                                against homophobia in the workplace and in the
                                adoption process.<\/p>\n

                                The 1980s were Pastre&#8217;s most prolific
                                decade, touching almost every area of queer life
                                in France and beyond. In 1982, within months of
                                helping to found France&#8217;s Gay Pride
                                movement, Pastre became the president of
                                Frequence Gaie, FM Paris&#8217;s gay-interest
                                radio station. Despite leaving FG in 1984, she
                                continued to host a weekly show on Radio
                                Libertaire, showcasing other French queer and
                                feminist activists. In the world of publishing,
                                Pastre not only founded Editions G. Pastre, a
                                press dedicated to progressive and feminist
                                authors, but also Les Octaviennes, a collective
                                for lesbian authors active in France.<\/p>\n

                                issues. Pastre&#8217;s party helped successfully
                                persuade the World Health Organisation to
                                declassify homosexuality as a mental illness;
                                similarly, France was, in 1999, the first
                                country to remove transsexualism from a national
                                list of mental disorders. Pressure from Les
                                Mauves also contributed to Amnesty
                                International&#8217;s decision to support banned
                                homosexuality as one of the grounds for seeking
                                asylum.<\/p>\n

                                At the age of 87, Pastre continues to write
                                extensively on arts, politics and queer history:
                                she has also organised festivals of queer
                                culture, including the 1990 Festival
                                europ\u00e9en de l&#8217;\u00e9criture gaie et
                                lesbienne, in Paris. Active worldwide in the
                                feminist and queer rights movements,
                                Pastre&#8217;s influence can be felt not only in
                                French activism, theatre, academia and
                                publishing, but internationally. Beyond her
                                enviable contributions to French culture, her
                                work with Les Mauves has helped transform the
                                status, rights and prospects of LGBT people
                                around the world. No revolting woman could have
                                done more.<\/p>\n
