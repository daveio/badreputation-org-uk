              &#8220;Better Strangers started with Clouds and Jessie, two queer
              feminist geeks. We met through LARP and bonded over a mutual love
              of opera, together with frustration at the lack of available jobs.
              Clouds is now in her second year of a singing course at music
              school. Jessie is a youth worker at the <a
              href=\"http:\/\/www.elop.org\/\">East London Out Project<\/a>, and
              does freelance community arts with people with profound and
              multiple learning disabilities. We both have literature degrees.
              Jessie likes queer theory and graphic novels. Clouds likes metal
              and baking. Pleased to meet you!&#8221;<\/p>\n<div

              Strangers<\/a> coalesced into an actual concept some time around
              May 2010. Our stated aim is to create musical performances by,
              with and for all kinds of women, and to use these to reach out to
              people who might normally feel excluded from opera.&#8221;<\/p>\n

                >We love the idea of feminist opera &#8211; what role does it
                play in opera as a whole and in the wider arts
                world?<\/strong><\/p>\n
                <p>
                  &#8220;To the best of our awareness, Better Strangers is the
                  only feminist opera company in existence. There are occasional
                  feminist productions dotted around, but no other companies
                  dedicated to performing them, as far as we can tell. So
                  that\u2019s a start. In addition to putting on feminist
                  productions of existing operas, we\u2019ll be commissioning
                  new music from female composers, asking female writers to
                  contribute song lyrics and stories, and opening up discussions
                  about women\u2019s roles in opera, and how and why they need
                  to change.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  &#8220;At least two thirds of any singing class in a music
                  school is likely to be made up of women &#8211; most of them
                  sopranos &#8211; and yet each commonly performed opera will
                  contain two, maybe three roles for the &#8216;female&#8217;
                  soprano, mezzo or alto register. It\u2019s a hugely (and in
                  some ways needlessly) competitive world. So, instead of
                  wringing our hands about the dwindling interest in opera and
                  classical music, why not create more? Our commissioned works
                  will address this problem in two ways: firstly, by including
                  more soprano, mezzo and alto roles; and secondly, by scoring
                  many of them for small groups of instruments, so that they can
                  be easily performed with limited space and resources.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  &#8220;As well as performers, we\u2019re encouraging
                  contributions from female directors, MDs, producers (<a

                  technicians, librettists and artists. Women composers are more
                  widely recognised now than they have ever been, with <a

                  commissioned by women, but there is still a lot of work to be
                  done. We hope that as we bring the work of stage professionals
                  and writers to light, women might start to be taken more
                  seriously across the arts world.<\/p>\n

                <p>
                  &#8220;Our feminism will be intersectional, or it will be <a

                  We at Better Strangers are interested in stories, and
                  particularly stories that aren\u2019t often told. This means

                    What are your opinions on the roles available to women in
                    opera?<\/strong><\/p>\n
                    <p>
                      &#8220;The premise of
                      <strong
                        >Ah! Forget My Fate!<\/strong> is that women are very
                        frequently typecast. The most common types of female
                        characters are the weepy virgin, the terrible slut, the
                        saucy servant girl, or the boy. In operas written before
                        1820 there were a lot more witches and evil sorceresses,
                        but the villain\u2019s role was handed over to basses
                        later on. That\u2019s it. If you\u2019re a weepy virgin
                        or a terrible slut in an opera written after 1830,
                        chances are you\u2019ll go mad or get consumption and
                        die. Bad luck!<\/p>\n
                        <p>
                          &#8220;How does one sing with consumption anyway? A
                          wasting disease of the lungs and throat plays havoc
                          with your timbre. There are a few exceptions, of
                          course. We just want to create more of them. Besides,
                          what about the mezzos who want to play a bold,
                          upstanding young hero? Or the basses who want to play
                          weepy, consumptive virgins?<\/p>\n
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          &#8220;There is a heavy heteronormative gender bias in
                          opera, which is kind of silly because not all
                          sopranos, mezzos and altos are women, and not all
                          tenors, baritones and basses are men. CN Lester of <a

                              astonishing and disturbing how often the
