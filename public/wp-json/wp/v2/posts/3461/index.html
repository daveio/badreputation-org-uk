<p>
  When your mother is a Russian aristocrat convalescing in Switzerland and your
  father is an Armenian anarchist ex-priest you have to do some pretty special
  things with your life just to balance out the sheer coolness of your own
  birth. Isabelle Eberhardt does not disappoint, living a life that seemed
  straight from the pages of Adventure and its pulp ilk.<\/p>\n

  \/><\/a>In 1901, aged 24, Eberhardt was attacked by a sabre-wielding assassin
  whilst praying at an Algerian mosque. She survived, but her left arm was
  almost severed. A reasonable response to this might be to get quite upset,
  feel somewhat hostile towards the man who just attempted to murder you, and
  ask for him to be punished to the full extent of the law. Eberhardt however
  had reached a stage in her life where she was quite simply too badass to be
  upset by little things like assassination attempts. Instead she chose to
  forgive her assailant and later represented him in court, successfully arguing
  for his life to be spared.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  How did the daughter of a Russian aristocrat, born in Geneva, end up facing
  assassination attempts in Algeria? It started with her anarchist tutor father,
  who taught her Arabic and other languages, horse-riding, theology, and
  literature. The interest in literature in turn led her to the work of Julien
  Viaud, a French lieutenant serving in North Africa and writing under the pen
  name <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pierre_Loti\"><strong
    >Pierre Loti<\/strong><\/a>. Loti\u2019s writing sparked a fascination with
    North Africa, which coupled with a weariness of Geneva\u2019s formal society
    and hostility from her older step-siblings, who disliked her father,
    convinced Eberhardt that she needed to do some travelling of her own.<\/p>\n
    <p>
      Travelling to Algiers with her mother in 1897, both of them quickly
      converted to Islam. They began to travel North Africa but Eberhardt\u2019s
      mother passed away, as did her father back in Europe shortly afterwards.
      With her family ties severed, Eberhardt was free to fully devote herself
      to her travels. To this end she adopted the identity of a young man,
      taking the name Si Mahmoud Essadi. Having apparently developed a knack for
      the art of disguise, and being fluent in Arabic, she had little trouble
      blending in and taking advantage of the greater freedoms her new identity
      allowed her.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Travelling around North Africa under the guise of Si Mahmoud, Eberhardt
      became involved with the <a
      href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Qadiriyyah\">Qadiriyya<\/a>, a
      secretive and radical Sufi brotherhood. The Qadiriyya were strongly
      opposed to colonial rule of Algeria and struggled against it, whilst also
      attempting to help the poor. Eberhardt, who by this point had begun
      writing journals and perhaps attempting to follow the path of Loti, threw
      herself into the Qadiryya cause, penning articles and works of prose
      railing against the French rule and celebrating the local culture. This is
      most likely what led to the assassination attempt against her, described
      earlier.<\/p>\n

        \nOne very graceful impression is that of sunset over the port and the
        terraces of the upper town, and the gay Algerian women; a whole playful
        world in pink and green on the slightly blue-tinted white of the uneven
        and disorderly terraces. It\u2019s from the little lattice window of
        Madame Ben Aben that you discover all this.<\/p>\n
      </p>

      <p>
        Later that same year, having survived the near-severing of her arm,
        Eberhardt married an Algerian soldier, Slimane Ehnni. This didn\u2019t
        slow her down though, as she continued to travel and write, acting as a
        war correspondent in the South of Oran for the French press. She also
        continued to push social boundaries, writing in her journals about
        adventures with alcohol and other intoxicants. Alongside her devotion to
        her adopted faith, her anarchist upbringing and free spirit kept her
        bending and breaking rules to experience every possible moment of her
        new country.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          I am not afraid of death, but would not want to die in some obscure or
          pointless way.<\/p>\n

        <p>
          How does Eberhardt\u2019s tale end? In a manner entirely suited to the
          general badass themes of Eberhardt\u2019s life as a whole. In 1904,
          after another extended journey of exploration and writing, Eberhardt
          reunited with her husband in A\u00efn S\u00e9fra, an area remarkable
          for its dryness even by Algerian standards. The pair had barely
          settled in when a flash flood struck the area and their house \u2013
          made of clay \u2013 collapsed on them. <\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          Eberhardt escaped, but swam back in to pull her husband out. She
          managed to get him to safety but lost her own life in the process.
          Drowning in a flood in the middle of a desert, giving her own life to
          save someone she\u2019d spent a long period estranged from, aged only
          27. Arguably Eberhardt achieved her wish, fitting in one last act of
          boldness in a thoroughly unusual incident.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          Following her death, Eberhardt\u2019s journals were rescued from the
          flood. They document the last four years of her life and her
          adventures around North Africa. Along with <a
          href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Isabelle_Eberhardt#Writing\">a
          novel and several articles<\/a> written for French newspapers these
          have cemented Eberhardt as one of the 20th century&#8217;s most bold
          and fascinating of wanderers.<\/p>\n
