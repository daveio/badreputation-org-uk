    <p>Picture this.<\/p>\n</p>
    <p>It&#8217;s Friday night.<\/p>\n</p>
    <p>
      I&#8217;m a young woman of 25.\u00a0 I have several friends. I celebrate
      Christmas. These two facts have combined to create FESTIVE OPPORTUNITY! So
      I&#8217;m going to a house party in East London. I&#8217;ve dressed up a
      bit and everything.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      It is snowing heavily. I&#8217;ve wrapped up warm, but it&#8217;s obvious
      I&#8217;m a bit dressed up; mini skirt, tights, thigh high socks over the
      tights, stompy boots (OK, I&#8217;m a bit of a goth). I feel good about
      the way I look.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2123\" style=\"width: 196px\"

    <p>
      The party goes great. I leave at about midnight, and am juuust too late to
      make the last Tube home. On the way out, I catch sight of the new poster
      encouraging me to take a licensed minicab. It says, <a
      href=\"http:\/\/www.tfl.gov.uk\/corporate\/media\/newscentre\/archive\/17534.aspx\">IF
      YOUR MINICAB&#8217;S NOT BOOKED, IT&#8217;S JUST A STRANGER&#8217;S
      CAR<\/a>. It seems to have replaced the triggertastic, victim-blame-loaded
      images from a couple of years ago, which showed a woman&#8217;s screaming,
      tearslicked face and bore the headline &#8220;<a
      href=\"http:\/\/www.thisislondon.co.uk\/standard\/article-23881504-illegal-minicab-sex-attacks-up-50-percent-in-year.do\">STOP,
      PLEASE, NO, PLEASE, STOP&#8230; taking unlicensed minicabs<\/a>.&#8221; I
      was not a fan of that campaign, well-meaning though it was. It was a giant
      neon cultural signpost as far as I was concerned: ladies, rape is
      <em
        >your<\/em> problem, sort it.<\/p>\n
        <p>
          The streets are covered in thick ice. I have to pick my way very
          slowly through it, even in my stompy-but-relatively-practical boots,
          to avoid falling.\u00a0 A couple of guys outside a pub have things to
          say about the delectability of my arse as I do this. Their commentary
          isn&#8217;t particularly appreciated.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          There are barely any nightbuses running. I realise, shivering and
          fumbling for my wallet, that I want a minicab. A licensed one.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          The rest of my night is an expensive nightmare which opens my eyes to
          just how much quite a lot of people are happy to exploit my need to
          get home safely. And how many people out there think that if I want to
          be safe without paying through the nose, I shouldn&#8217;t be out at
          all.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          Leytonstone&#8217;s not the life and soul of London on a Friday night,
          but there are quite a lot of people out, so there must be a few house
          parties going down. There are several women, at varying levels of
          party-dressed, in varying states of sobriety. It just so happens that
          tonight I&#8217;m sober. All of us are looking for a way home. A fair
          number of us are travelling alone.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          There is one minicab office in the area I&#8217;m trying to navigate.
          It&#8217;s the only one I can see. I&#8217;ve used it before and
          it&#8217;s usually been fine. The office has several women milling
          about outside it. Encouraged, I go in.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          The man behind the counter studies me with a faintly critical eye. I
          tell him I want to go to South London &#8211; a long journey, so
          I&#8217;m prepared for some outlay.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          &#8220;Normally,&#8221; says Counter Dude, a little nervously,
          &#8220;that&#8217;d be \u00a335.&#8221;<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>Okay.<\/p>\n</p>
        <p>
          There is some nudging and muttering going on behind the glass. I
          wonder if my skirt is rucked up or something. It all looks
          okay.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>&#8220;Tonight is fare-and-a-half night.&#8221;<\/p>\n</p>
        <p>
          Ah. Fare-and-a-half-night. That famous British institution WAIT
          WHAT.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be \u00a353.&#8221;<\/p>\n</p>
        <p>
          What the
          <em
            >shit.<\/em><\/p>\n
            <p>
              &#8220;We&#8217;re charging extra,&#8221; says Counter Dude,
              &#8220;just for tonight.&#8221;<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              I look out the window at the snow, and the shivering lone women.
              Is it just the snow that&#8217;s suddenly made the petrol so
              expensive? Or is it more the crowd of women the snow has delivered
              into the arms of the minicab company that&#8217;s occasioned this
              spontaneous jolly price-hike? I look back at Counter Dude.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              <em
                >&#8220;Just tonight,&#8221;<\/em> I say pointedly.<\/p>\n
                <p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;<\/p>\n</p>
                <p>There&#8217;s an awkward silence.<\/p>\n</p>
                <p>
                  &#8220;Unlucky,&#8221; he proffers, after a brief
                  conversational abyss while he searches for a word with which
                  to label my predicament. &#8220;You&#8217;re unlucky being out
                  tonight.&#8221;<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  What follows is essentially a Paddington Bear-style stare-out,
                  which I win. My prize? A &#8220;discount&#8221; taking my fare
                  down by a fiver. Still \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3 more than I&#8217;d
                  usually be charged. You&#8217;re damn right I&#8217;m unlucky.

                  Here&#8217;s the deal, guys: I know it&#8217;s snowing this
                  week, GUYS, EVERYBODY CAN SEE IT IS SNOWING THIS WEEK. I know
                  that in all likelihood, you&#8217;re charging dudes the same
                  amount.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  But here it is, right, here&#8217;s the thing: hardly any
                  dudes are in this cab office. More women are taking your cabs,
                  because (cis, at least) men do not have the same sense of
                  personal risk going home alone at night after a thing like a
                  party. Most of my male friends rolled home. My boyfriend
                  regularly rolls home when he&#8217;s had a few at a party!
                  I&#8217;d love to be able to roll home in the same way! But
                  often I don&#8217;t
                  <em
                    >feel<\/em> able to. Especially not since a female
                    acquaintance of mine from the same area was sexually
                    assaulted on public transport less than a year ago. I went
                    past a yellow police

                      <p>
                        ALL OF WHICH IS TO SAY THAT when you notice a
                        predominantly female bunch of customers need cabs, and
                        rack up your prices in kneejerk response, on a night
                        when it&#8217;s particularly difficult to do anything

                              I&#8217;m not saying that women are more likely to
                              be attacked than men; this would not be true. But
                              there

                                that women walking alone at night, especially if

                                                  licensed cab is coming right
                                                  out of my Christmas overdraft.
                                                  I wonder how many women are
                                                  tempted by the riskier
                                                  option.<\/p>\n

                                                  Probably quite a few.<\/p>\n

                                                  In the cab, which is not,
                                                  ALAS, plated with gold and

                                                  driver&#8217;s so annoyed
                                                  I&#8217;ve argued the fare
                                                  down further to a

                                                  spends our journey informing
                                                  me that I should be
                                                  &#8220;grateful&#8221; his
                                                  boss &#8220;felt like being
                                                  nice&#8221; to me. Eventually
                                                  I just slip my headphones into
                                                  my ears and overlay his voice
                                                  with a nice Christmassy choir.
                                                  Much better.<\/p>\n
