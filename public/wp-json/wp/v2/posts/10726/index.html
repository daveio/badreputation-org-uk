  While we&#8217;re still sloshing around in the journalistic sewage unleashed
  by the Leveson enquiry, it seems like a good time to revisit some research
  into media misrepresentation I did back in 2007.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  I looked at a sample of 316 articles about the trafficking of women for sexual
  exploitation drawn from UK national newspapers between September 2005 and
  September 2007. After speaking to some lucky people studying this topic today,
  I\u2019m sad to say it hasn\u2019t changed much. In fact it hasn&#8217;t
  changed much since, ooh, 1885.<\/p>\n

  The Maiden Tribute<\/h3>\n
  <p>
    The publication of a feature on &#8220;<a

    Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon<\/a>&#8221; in the
    <strong
      >Pall Mall Gazette<\/strong> in 1885 is often credited as the birth of
      scandal journalism, and the touchpaper for a moral panic over \u201cwhite
      slavery\u201d which rocked Victorian Britain. The similarity with
      today\u2019s newspaper coverage of trafficking for sexual exploitation is
      striking. And, frankly, depressing.<\/p>\n
      <p>
        The famous
        <strong
          >Pall Mall Gazette<\/strong> feature describes in titillating detail
          how \u201cfive pound virgins\u201d are sold to lecherous aristocratic
          blackguards, after being &#8220;snared, trapped and outraged either
          when under the influence of drugs or after prolonged struggle in a
          locked room&#8221;. Thanks to the wonders of the web, the full article

          href=\"http:\/\/www.attackingthedevil.co.uk\/pmg\/tribute\/mt1.php\">read
          online<\/a>. What is remarkable about it isn\u2019t so much the
          contents of the article itself, but the reaction it provoked \u2013 a
          massive pile-on of outraged public opinion, political opportunism and
          rival newspaper bandwagon-jumping. Here\u2019s a good <a
          href=\"http:\/\/www.walnet.org\/csis\/papers\/irwin-wslavery.html\">description<\/a>
          of the aftermath.<\/p>\n
          <p>
            While it is undeniable that prostitution was widespread in Britain
            of the 19th century (and it wasn\u2019t a nice life) the actual
            incidence of kidnap and \u2018sexual slavery\u2019 of the form
            described in
            <strong
              >The Maiden Tribute<\/strong> has since been subject to scrutiny.
              Historians, in particular <a
              href=\"http:\/\/books.google.co.uk\/books\/about\/Prostitution_and_Victorian_Society.html?id=3wbfmH9L9qoC&amp;redir_esc=y\">Judith
              Walkowitz<\/a>, have highlighted the discrepancy between the
              reformers&#8217; view and the reality of prostitution in the
              1880s, observing that:<\/p>\n
              <blockquote>
                <p>
                  the evidence of widespread involuntary prostitution of British
                  girls in London and abroad is slim. During the 1870s and
                  1880s, officials and reformers were able to uncover a small
                  traffic in women between Britain and the continent, although
                  the women enticed into licensed brothels in Antwerp and
                  Brussels were by no means the young innocents depicted in the
                  sensational stories. Similarly, there undoubtedly were some
                  child prostitutes on the streets of London, Liverpool, and
                  elsewhere; most of these young girls were not victims of false
                  entrapment.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  Arguably the popularity of the &#8216;white slavery&#8217;
                  myth was partly because it offered an easy option of blaming a
                  few evil, anonymous, male individuals for the hardships
                  experienced by women and girls working in prostitution.
                  Confronting the sexual double standard, crushing poverty and
                  ignorance and the vast power imbalance between men and women
                  would probably have landed the blame a little close to home
                  for most readers.<\/p>\n

                    Doezema<\/a> compares the explosion of media coverage of sex
                    trafficking since 2000 (linked to the EU expansion and
                    attendant mass immigration freakout) to the white slavery
                    panic of the 1880s, identifying a number of similar themes
                    &#8211; in particular the emphasis on the victim\u2019s
                    \u2018innocence\u2019, which she interprets as a device to
                    make a distinction between legitimate victims and
                    \u2018guilty victims\u2019: prostitutes. Doezema

                      &#8216;innocence&#8217; is established in a number of
                      ways: through stressing the &#8216;victims&#8217; lack of
                      knowledge of or unwillingness to accede to her fate; her
                      youth &#8212; equated with sexual unawareness and thus

                        The most obviously emphasised characteristic of the
                        victims in the sample of newspapers I studied was youth.
                        In virtually all the coverage the age of the woman was
                        stated, and case studies of teenagers placed the age
                        right at the start of the article. The few cases in
                        which the woman was over 21 (the oldest was 36) stated
                        the age in later paragraphs.<\/p>\n

                      <p>
                        From my sample of 316 articles (which excluded those
                        focused on trafficking in children) showed that 68%
                        \u00a0used the word \u201cgirl\u201d to describe the
                        trafficked women, and 59% described the women as

                        <strong
                          >Sunday Express<\/strong> opens the article with the
                          age of the victim: \u201cDana was just 15 when she was
                          brought to Britain on the promise of a summer job
                          selling ice creams in London&#8217;s Hyde Park, but
                          she ended up becoming a sex slave, forced to have sex
                          with 50 men a week.\u201d Dana\u2019s youth is
                          emphasised by the childlike associations of \u2018ice
                          cream\u2019 and her \u2018summer job\u2019, strongly
                          evocative of school. Even \u2018London\u2019s Hyde
                          Park\u2019 has a suggestion of a summer holiday. The
                          journalist gleefully sets up a shocking contrast with
                          her following enslavement.<\/p>\n

                              Part of the importance of emphasising the youth of
                              the victims is the implication of their innocence.
                              Plenty of articles in the sample described the
                              women explicitly as innocent: \u201cinnocent women
                              like Maria\u201d; \u201cinnocents\u2026 abducted

                                >The Sun<\/strong> in 2006). However, many
                                others conjure the idea of innocence through
                                stressing vulnerability, naivety and terror, in
                                combination with youth. One of the most visually
                                striking is a description of two
