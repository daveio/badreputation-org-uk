<p>
  Here we are again, with another round! If you&#8217;ve not been keeping up,
  Christmas Songnerd is my attempt at some little case studies on some of the
  &#8216;Christmas classics&#8217; currently assaulting your ears as you forge a
  path through the hordes of your local shopping centre. You may hate all
  Christmas music, or you may love it \u2013 personally I\u2019ve never minded
  it much \u2013 but pop singles are like miniature time capsules, so examining
  their gender politics and the culture they were produced in is&#8230; you
  know. Interesting.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  Anyway, today I&#8217;ve hauled our Rhian in to talk about
  <strong
    >Fairytale of New York<\/strong>, the Pogues&#8217; and Kirsty
    MacColl&#8217;s Christmas anthem. The following is our email discussion
    about the song, the 1980s, folk music, and class politics.<\/p>\n

    <h3>
      Happy Christmas Your Arse<\/h3>\n
      <p>
        <strong
          >Rhian:<\/strong> I think one reason the song is so popular is because
          it seems like an oddity &#8211; it&#8217;s highly secular, the only
          mention of anything to do with Christmas is the setting, and it
          dissects romantic sentimentalism rather than replicating it &#8211;
          the lyric is of a part with the rest of the Pogues&#8217; tragicomic
          gutter-poetry dealing with addiction, nihilism, prostitution, police
          corruption and brutality. Besides making it stand out among other
          seasonal songs, this also makes it the choice of the Christmas
          refusenik. In another way, of course, its depiction of dysfunctional
          relationships, exhaustion, frustration, frayed tempers and failed
          dreams make it the perfect song for Christmas as emotional
          pressure-valve.<\/p>\n
          <p>
            <strong
              >Miranda:<\/strong> Yeah, it manages a keen balancing act of
              romantic and antiromantic, if you will &#8211; it sways between
              &#8220;I&#8217;ve built my dreams around you&#8221; and
              &#8220;you&#8217;re an old slut on junk&#8221; so deftly that I
              can never decide whether its final notes leave me depressed or
              hopeful. It&#8217;s got that whole &#8220;we&#8217;re ruined,
              irrevocably, and yet I love you&#8221; vibe, without ever straying
              into &#8216;stand by your man&#8217; territory.<\/p>\n

                  <strong
                    >Rhian:<\/strong> Kirsty&#8217;s character makes a good
                    subversive girl-next-door, overcoming taboos around female
                    profanity, the place of women in a relationship, and the
                    female as uncritically supportive of and subservient to the
                    male. (After punk, and apart from Madonna maybe, which other
                    mainstream late-80s female singers &#8211; especially
                    folk\/pop &#8211; compare with her vocal here for casual,
                    combative profanity that matches, if not outdoes, her
                    partner?)<\/p>\n
                    <p>
                      I remember watching a &#8216;Making of&#8230;&#8217;
                      documentary on this song in which one of the Pogues was
                      describing Kirsty&#8217;s efforts to overcome her
                      stagefright when doing the song on tour with them, and
                      recalled that on the first night they performed it, the
                      crowd joined in with her, rather than Shane, on the
                      <em
                        >&#8216;I could&#8217;ve been someone&#8217; \/
                        &#8216;Well, so could anyone&#8217;<\/em> rejoinder.
                        Which made me think about her part as the one with which
                        listeners identify, the long-suffering steadfast
                        partner\/friend who finally talks back, providing
                        much-needed perspective, however depressing that is, and
                        the relief and catharsis that doing so brings.
                        It&#8217;s like she speaks for all the women slaving
                        over Xmas dinner for ungrateful kids and
                        husbands.<\/p>\n
                        <p>
                          <strong
                            >Miranda:<\/strong> Although Shane&#8217;s character
                            asserts a kind of ownership of Kirsty&#8217;s dreams
                            (he&#8217;s the one who takes, builds, attempts to
                            reassure her that she sits at the centre of the
                            dream it sounds like
                            <em
                              >he<\/em> screwed up), he starts the song
                              imprisoned in the &#8220;drunk tank&#8221; &#8211;
                              implying she&#8217;s a dream, this woman, a figure
                              from times past. So maybe where she is now &#8211;
                              free, perhaps, who knows? &#8211; is left open.
                              And I think that&#8217;s another thing that
                              underpins the bittersweet, shady-grey spirit of
                              this song. It&#8217;s never clear whose story this
                              is, and there&#8217;s a real tension between her
                              narrations and his, which draw the song back to a
                              romantic, but broken, conclusion even as her
                              &#8220;I pray god it&#8217;s our last&#8221; is
                              still sort of echoing. Maybe it was, or maybe it
                              wasn&#8217;t.<\/p>\n
                              <p>

                                  >Rhian:<\/strong> That&#8217;s one of my
                                  favourite aspects of the song &#8211; what did
                                  happen to this couple, in the end? Does she
                                  come and pick him up from the drunk tank and
                                  bail him out after the song&#8217;s close, or
                                  has she OD&#8217;d years previously, or is she
                                  happily settled in her own life now? And yes,
                                  it nicely dodges the expected
                                  stand-by-your-man stuff. Actually it&#8217;s
                                  very even-handed in the way they both berate
                                  each other, sounding equally foul-mouthed and
                                  irritable, presumably he&#8217;s got his
                                  drinking and she&#8217;s got her junk so
                                  they&#8217;re both in the grip of addiction
                                  &#8211; again it subverts the idea of the meek
                                  and submissive female innocent under the
                                  grubby domineering male thumb.<\/p>\n

                                      takes the folk figure of the lonely
                                      drunkard singing about his old flame and
                                      brings her directly into the song to talk
                                      back.<\/p>\n

                                          foils, who suddenly clears her throat
                                          and interrupts the narrative with her
