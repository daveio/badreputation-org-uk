<p>
  It&#8217;s the Festive Season, so we are putting up tinsel on the collective
  BadRep Christmas tree and trying not to speculate too deeply on the reason why
  we lug a lot of greenery into the house during winter time (it&#8217;s not
  pagan, it&#8217;s traditional. Honest). We are also shopping for gifts. I like
  presents. I like selecting the right ones for my nearest and dearest so they
  know that I love them, and that I&#8217;ve spent at least some part of my life
  thinking about what would be most appropriate to give them. Hopefully
  they&#8217;ve done the same thing too, and we shall all be happy.\u00a0
  However, the process of actually getting those gifts is fraught with danger
  and turmoil of the gendered kind. Because at this time of the year, more so
  than perhaps any other, we see the division along the pink and blue lines
  where people are encouraged to think of Gifts For Him and Gifts For Her. A
  quick trawl through the websites of some of the UK&#8217;s most popular
  Christmas stores shows this wave of sexual stereotyping crashing on the shores
  of our present-buying choices.<\/p>\n

      I&#8217;ve selected the girly items to avoid over-linking, but the ones
      for men are just as bad, though less eye-gougingly pastel. Department
      stores like <a
      href=\"http:\/\/www.debenhams.com\/webapp\/wcs\/stores\/servlet\/category_10001_10001_165614_-1\">Debenhams
      <\/a>and <a
      href=\"http:\/\/www.selfridges.com\/en\/Christmas\/Categories\/Gifts-for-her\/\">Selfridges<\/a>
      dole out the standard patter of perfume, chocolates, underwear, jewellery,
      handbags and ungents. (Expensive) stuff to eat and (expensive) stuff to
      wear. That&#8217;s what women want, clearly.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Now before anyone begins with the &#8220;But I am a woman and I like
      flowers\/scent\/bags\/this maribou feather hat and gloves combo&#8221;.
      Yes. That is fine. Good. Carry on. There is
      <em
        >nothing wrong<\/em> with individuals liking things that are
        traditionally ascribed to their gender. Wearing pink does not make you a
        Bad Feminist (TM). But there is a whole heap wrong with assuming that
        someone must like those things
        <em
          >because<\/em> they are a woman. And that is just what is happening on
          the High Street right now. Millions of people are walking around
          choosing gifts sold to them under these headlines.<\/p>\n
          <p>
            These are tropes so ingrained that it seems almost part of our
            social furniture. Girls get X and Boys get Y. Even at this time of
            goodwill to all, we seem unable to shake the idea that gender is
            biologically constructed and that our chromosomes deliver different
            desires so that shopping arcade Santas can conveniently wrap it all
            up in cis-tastic cerise and cyan. I appreciate that it is useful for
            businesses to be able to categorise gifts into different areas for
            ease of shopping, but this gendered nonsense has to stop. Not only
            is it reductive and ridiculous, it also makes the present less
            special, less unique to that supposedly unique person in your life
            because it&#8217;s just the same as what half of the population is
            supposed to want. Fortunately, for all of you frantic shoppers out
            there who unlike me probably have a family larger than four (yup,
            it&#8217;s just me, my parents and my brother) there is a solution.
            You could do what the biggest Christmas retailer has done and
            just<em>
              browse by category<\/em>. That&#8217;s right, <a
              href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/ref=gno_logo\">Amazon<\/a>, in a
              stroke of genius, have divided their goods up
              <em
                >according to the type of item.<\/em> Not For Girls or For Boys
                but, you know, For People. Who like things.<\/p>\n
                <p>
                  So I&#8217;ll be buying from them this year. And I suggest you
                  do too.<\/p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy
