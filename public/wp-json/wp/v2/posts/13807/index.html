        What
        <em
          >do<\/em> you call a female astronaut? These are some of the ingenious
          words that journalists invented in the early 1960s to avoid having to
          say \u2018astronaut\u2019 when describing\u00a0<strong
            >Jerrie Cobb<\/strong>, the first woman to pass NASA tests and
            qualify as an astronaut, although she never had a chance to go into
            space.<\/p>\n
            <p>
              I\u2019ve been thinking about astronauts recently for two reasons.
              Firstly, a friend of mine lent me this\u00a0<a
              href=\"http:\/\/books.google.co.uk\/books?id=bT8HU-BpiwkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\"

              13\u2032 \u2013 women including Cobb who were trained as
              astronauts but never went into space because America wasn\u2019t
              brave enough.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              Secondly, I discovered a pile of my old school reports in my
              mum\u2019s flat the other day and was astonished to read that my
              stated career ambition at age 11 was \u2018astronaut\u2019. I
              mean, I loved space and stars and rockets \u2013 are there any
              kids that don\u2019t? And I do remember wanting to be an
              astronaut. But at 11? It makes me wonder how old I was when I gave
              up wanting to be a knight of the round table&#8230;<\/p>\n

              <p>
                I\u2019m not going to rant about how being an astronaut
                shouldn\u2019t be a distant dream for a girl. Let\u2019s face
                it, astronauting isn\u2019t an easy line to get into &#8211;
                it\u2019s a distant dream for most people. Apparently there have
                been 512 humans in space, of which 10% have been women (<a

                target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia<\/a> \u00a0has a list of space
                travellers.) Unimpressive, I agree, but when you bear in mind
                that we can scarcely get women into the House of Commons (around
                20% of MPs are women) getting them into space seems like less of
                a priority.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>

                                  Lathers sees an identification of the feminine
                                  with mother earth and nature, setting them in
                                  opposition to space and even to science. Given
                                  this conflict she suggests that women in space
                                  are more frequently aligned with the alien
                                  (our old friend the Other) than with the human
                                  space adventurer. She sez:<\/p>\n

                                    Feminist theory needs to assess the
                                    possibilities that rethinking women in space
