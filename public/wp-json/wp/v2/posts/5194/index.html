  I was very worried about this film, having watched <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=uHBnrJowBZE\">the trailer<\/a> and
  become fearful that it might go the way of the
  <strong
    >Hulk<\/strong> franchise. It had a similar feel to it &#8211; lots of
    rippling muscles and anger with cars being thrown around.<\/p>\n
    <p>
      I am pleased to say that I was wrong. And
      <strong
        >Thor<\/strong> is, in fact, awesome. In all ways. Although especially
        in the way that
        <strong
          >Chris Hemsworth<\/strong> is jaw-droppingly attractive and takes his
          shirt off for extended periods. Also his biceps appear to be gearing
          up to eat Tokyo. And there&#8217;s

              Now, when I tell you the plot you&#8217;ll tell me that I have
              gone mad for liking it, and that I was blinded by the sight of
              such a perfect male specimen. In my defence, this is an actor cast
              to play Thor, so he needs to be at least a bit buff.<\/p>\n

              world with crystal palaces and epic science\/magic. The rainbow
              bridge (guarded by Heimdall, played by the brilliant-in-everything
              <strong
                >Idris Elba<\/strong>) allows them to blast their way to other
                planets. Using the argument that any sufficiently advanced
                science is indistinguishable from magic, they are worshipped as
                gods by the primitive Vikings.<\/p>\n
                <p>
                  Thus when a chap falls to earth (landing in a small town
                  somewhere in the sandy <a
                  href=\"http:\/\/www.urbandictionary.com\/define.php?term=square+states\">square
                  states<\/a>) and proclaims himself Thor, everyone thinks
                  he&#8217;s a bit mad. Especially when the rampaging starts.
                  However, some handy scientists need him for some handy
                  science, and then there&#8217;s this hammer that no-one can

                <p>
                  This all had the potential to be cringingly awful and cheesy,
                  but fortunately it was handled in a rarely-seen triumphal
                  triumvirate of sensitive and nuanced acting, balanced
                  direction (<strong
                    >Kenneth Branagh<\/strong> at the helm, and he&#8217;s a man
                    who can deal with a lot of ham) and a script that focused on
                    that shyest of all beasts in the comic book action genre:
                    character development.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_5196\"

                                In the film, Thor gets kicked out of Valhalla by
                                Odin for being an annoying, spoilt teenager who
                                picks fights and starts wars. He needs to make

                                We follow Thor on his journey from arrogant,
                                angry young man to being, well, a grown up. His
                                essential good-naturedness and charm, as well as
                                obvious desire to do good, make this neither pat
                                nor schmaltzy, but wholly believable, and at
                                times exceptionally moving.<\/p>\n

                                to find himself. Rather than the standard trope
                                of being evil because he&#8217;s a villain
                                (although he is of course played by an English
                                actor), the whole thing is carried off with
                                depth, subtlety and aplomb by

                                    is only at the end that he makes the
                                    transition from a young warrior of potential
                                    into someone capable of evil. You know, <a
