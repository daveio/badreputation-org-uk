<blockquote>
  <p>
    Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto
    his wife, and they shall be one flesh.<\/p>\n
  </p>
  <p>Genesis 2.24<\/p><\/blockquote>\n</p>
  <p>
    So begins
    <em
      >marriage. <\/em>In this day and age, most people think of such
      &#8216;cleaving&#8217; as kinda cute, an emotional commitment
      &#8220;&#8217;til death do us part&#8221;; and indeed the
      union\u00a0matrimony represents (&#8216;bone of my bone, and flesh of my
      flesh&#8217;) begins with the word&#8217;s\u00a0Latin ancestor, the
      double-gendered\u00a0<em
        >maritus \/ marita <\/em>(= &#8216;husband \/ wife&#8217;).
        Ever-efficient, the Romans join husband and wife in one word, giving us,
        in miniature,\u00a0<em
          >marriage&#8217;s <\/em>first definition:\u00a0&#8216;the relation
          between married persons; wedlock&#8217;.<\/p>\n

                  the financial burden of bastard upkeep on society and oiling
