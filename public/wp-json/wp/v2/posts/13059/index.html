            Last week&#8217;s long-awaited, big-release comic was Kieron Gillen
            and Jamie McKelvie&#8217;s
            <strong
              >Young Avengers #1<\/strong>, a classic coming-of-age story about
              a group of 18-year-olds who just happen to be superheroes.<\/p>\n
              <p>
                While many mainstream comics are still producing the kind of
                material that gets sent up on <a

                target=\"_blank\">The Hawkeye Initiative<\/a>, Gillen and
                McKelvie actively reject the kind of objectification that gives
                the genre such a bad reputation amongst feminists. In contrast

                  >Young Avengers<\/strong> provides the reader with a
                  three-page essay on the (straight\/bi) female gaze. In a
                  medium that overwhelmingly caters for straight male desires,
                  this is a rare demonstration of how to do a sexy scene with
                  decent gender politics.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:

                    On page one, Kate Bishop wakes up in an unfamiliar bed,
                    having just hooked up with a man whose name she can&#8217;t
                    quite remember. At this point anyone who&#8217;s familiar
                    with comics, or popular culture in general, would expect to
                    see some slut-shaming, or at least some titillating
                    semi-nudity, but we get neither. Kate is dressed in a
                    t-shirt which comes down to her mid-thigh, and it&#8217;s
                    clear that she has no regrets, thinking:
                    <em
                      >For a second, some part of me thinks, \u201cI should be
                      ashamed.\u201d I think that part of me is really stupid.
                      <\/em><\/p>\n
                      <p>
                        In the fourth panel we even see Kate smiling as she
                        thinks back to the earlier part of her evening, and
                        it&#8217;s the smile of someone who has just got laid
                        and is pretty damned pleased with herself.<br \ />\nThe
                        second page introduces us to Noh-Varr, whose bed Kate
                        has woken up in, and this is where we see another
                        convention subverted, because he&#8217;s the one in
                        nothing but his underwear. In an interview with <a

                        McKelvie explains the idea behind this scene:<\/p>\n

                      <blockquote>
                        <p>
                          We&#8217;ve long had a problem in comics where the
                          women are &#8220;sexy&#8221; (in a sexist fashion) and
                          the men aren&#8217;t. Time to redress the balance. And
                          there&#8217;s a big difference between sexist and
                          sexy.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:

                          Although male superheroes are usually drawn with
                          extremely muscular physiques, it&#8217;s not normally
                          sexualised in this way \u2013 the reader is supposed
                          to want to
                          <em
                            >be<\/em> them, not have sex with them. This is a
                            rare acknowledgement that people who fancy men read
                            superhero comics too.<\/p>\n
                            <p>
                              But rather than providing equality of
                              objectification, the aim here is to have a sexy
                              scene which enhances the story and doesn&#8217;t
                              devalue either of the characters. If you&#8217;re
                              enjoying the view of Noh-Varr in his underwear,
                              it&#8217;s just a bonus, not the entire point of
                              the sequence; if you&#8217;re not into it, his
                              lack of clothes is incidental. As Gillen puts it

                                &#8230;characters being sexy is cool but
                                objectification in the process is bullshit. An
                                inability to see the difference is a fundamental
                                weakness. My wife\u2019s in the next room

                                But that works without anything which
                                annihilates him as a character,

                                The reader is supposed to see this scene through
                                Kate&#8217;s eyes, and as she watches Noh-Varr
                                dancing around in his pants, it acknowledges the
                                existence of the female gaze, both through
                                Kate&#8217;s interest in watching him, and the

                                Noh-Varr has a masculine appearance, but \u2013
                                perhaps because he&#8217;s an alien from another
                                dimension \u2013 he doesn&#8217;t appear to be
                                burdened with ideas of conventional masculinity,
                                as we can see from his music choices. The
                                comic&#8217;s title page states that the record

                                  groups\u201d in a way that a heterosexual
                                  Earth man probably wouldn&#8217;t, because
                                  he&#8217;d be afraid of seeming effeminate.
                                  The play on gender roles is, of course,
                                  entirely deliberate, as one of the major
                                  influences in this version of the character is

                                    As Kate watches Noh-Varr, the scene is
                                    interrupted by a Skrull attack (Skrulls are
                                    a species of warrior aliens that
                                    occasionally pop up in the Marvel Universe

                                    her killed in a disgustingly graphic way,
                                    but rather than being punished for her
                                    naughty behaviour, Kate is rewarded with
                                    another adventure, when she pilots the space
