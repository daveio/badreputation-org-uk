<p>
  You know you\u2019re pretty awesome when you\u2019re credited with founding a
  field of medicine. Not just a particular technique or methodology, which is
  impressive enough in itself, but a whole field of practice. It\u2019s the sort
  of achievement that you drop into conversation and then everyone else feels a
  little bit bad, because they will never do anything quite as cool. One person
  who can claim such an achievement is
  <strong
    >Dr Helen Taussig<\/strong>, pioneer of paediatric cardiology.<\/p>\n

      Taussig, taken during her time as a professor at Johns Hopkins
      University.<\/p><\/div>Prior to 1944, children born with a condition known
      as <a
      href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tetralogy_of_Fallot\">Tetralogy of
      Fallot<\/a> &#8211; or more commonly \u201cblue baby syndrome\u201d
      &#8211; could expect poor physical development, difficulty feeding, and an
      early death (untreated cases saw only 30% survive to the age of 10).
      Tetralogy of Fallot was the most common (400 cases out of every million
      live births) of complex heart defects and considered at the time to be
      surgically irreparable.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Taussig (b. 1898) had other ideas. Having studied at a series of
      prestigious schools, including Harvard, Taussig graduated from Johns
      Hopkins University Medical School in 1927, moving to Johns Hopkins
      Hospital to spend several years specialising in cardiology and
      paediatrics. In 1930 she was appointed head of the Children\u2019s Heart
      Clinic, making her one of the highest ranking women in American medicine
      at the time. She noted that infants with another particular heart
      deformity (patent ductus arteriosus, which allows blood to flow between
      the aorta and the pulmonary artery) who suffered from Tetralogy of Fallot
      tended to have better survivability than those with Tetralogy of Fallot
      alone.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Based on this, Taussig came to a conclusion that had evaded everyone else
      up until then: by creating an artificial hole, or shunt, between the two
      arteries it might be possible to overcome most of the problems caused by
      Tetralogy of Fallot. She took her ideas to Robert Gross, a surgeon at
      Boston who had pioneered patent ductus arteriosus ligation (the tying off
      of the hole between the arteries to stop the flow between them). Gross
      dismissed the idea, acting on the accepted wisdom of the time that stated
      the condition to be impossible to fix surgically. Without the help of an
      experienced cardiac surgeon, there would be no way to actually test
      Taussig\u2019s ideas.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the resistance from established surgeons, Taussig faced
      another obstacle to developing her idea: Around the time of graduating
      from Johns Hopkins she had become profoundly deaf, something which seemed,
      at the time, like it might put an end to her career. How could one
      practise cardiology without being able to hear heart rhythms through a
      stethoscope? Taussig was not one to be stopped by such trifling matters
      though, and developed an exceptional proficiency for feeling the rhythms
      by hand instead of listening to them, later crediting some of her
      discoveries to this talent.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>You must learn to listen with your fingers.<\/p>\n</p>
      <p>\u2013 Dr Helen Taussig<\/p><\/blockquote>\n</p>
      <p>
        This might be the point where a less awesome individual might give up,
        might let their idea drop and become just another footnote in medical
        history. Instead, Taussig approached Alfred Blalock, a recent
        appointment at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Together with his surgical
        technician, Vivien Thomas, they began to develop the idea, and by 1944
        were ready to perform their first operation on a person.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        The first operation was a qualified success &#8211; the initial surgery
        went well, but the patient didn\u2019t survive a follow up surgery the
        following year. The following two attempts were wholly successful, and
        by 1952 over 1,000 patients had undergone the Blalock-Taussig Shunt
        procedure, as it became known, with around 85% survival rates. Taussig
        and Blalock lectured on their technique in Paris and London, where
        surgeons experienced similar success rates.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        But pioneering a new field of medicine and improving the life expectancy
        and quality of life for countless infants wasn\u2019t enough for Taussig
        &#8211; she had more awesome achievements still to go. In 1957 the
        sedative drug <a
        href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Thalidomide\">Thalidomide<\/a>
        was distributed to thousands of clinicians in the US for testing,
        proposed as a safe drug for a variety of conditions. We now know, of
        course, that the drug was far from safe for this, having massively
        teratogenic properties. Taussig was one of the doctors, along with the
        FDA inspector <a
        href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Frances_Oldham_Kelsey\">Frances
        Oldham Kelsey<\/a>, who provided evidence for the dangers of the drug.
        This lead to its being refused approval for sale in the US, and
        eventually removed from other markets once its dangers had been
        exposed.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        So that\u2019s twice that Taussig was a key figure in improving the
        quality of life of infants, thus arguably making the world a better
        place through her actions. In addition to this she campaigned for the
        legalisation of abortion and became one of the first women to be
        appointed to a full professorship at Johns Hopkins University in 1959,
        and the first to serve as president of the American Heart Association.
        One of the four colleges of the Johns Hopkins medical school still bears
        her name.<\/p>\n

      <p>
        Her 1947 textbook,
        <strong
          >Congenital Malformations of the Heart<\/strong>, is worth reading
          whether or not one has a medical background, as it stands as an
          example of a very well written work by one of the field\u2019s most
          incisive minds.<\/p>\n
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              [Taussig] was truly a remarkably notable woman in health
              care.<\/p>\n
