  A spectre is haunting London. My daily commute, never a joyful affair, has
  recently been lent a further dimension of irritation by adverts on buses,
  hoving into view with tedious regularity, bearing the image of
  <strong

            experience<\/a> of the impact of Thatcher\u2019s thirteen years, her
            government\u2019s break with prevailing consensus and bloody-minded
            devotion to neoliberal orthodoxies, an objective and rational
            evaluation of the woman is probably beyond me. That said, her
            presumably impending death &#8211; although I do have a longstanding
            appointment at a pub in King&#8217;s Cross to dutifully raise a
            glass &#8211; is something to which I&#8217;ll be largely
            indifferent. It won&#8217;t matter. Thatcher as a person has far
            less bearing on the current world than what she represents. The
            damage has been done, the battle lost, and much as I might
            appreciate a Truth and Reconciliation Commission into the 1980s,
            Thatcher and her co-conspirators are by now <a
            href=\"http:\/\/www.newstatesman.com\/blogs\/steven-baxter\/2011\/12\/decisions-away-information\">too

            Efforts to humanise Thatcher, even when they enlist Meryl Streep,
            seem discomfiting and deeply bizarre. What she means has transcended
            what she was, is and will be. The purpose of this post, therefore,
            apart from being an exercise in detachment for me, is to look
            briefly at some aspects of Thatcher\u2019s image in political and
            pop culture, and to consider the effect of her gender on her role as
            a woman in power. Quick, before the next bus goes past.<\/p>\n

                    music<\/a>. The face of Thatcher most often called to mind
                    is that of what Angela Carter termed her \u2018balefully
                    iconic\u2019 post-1983 premiership: encased in true-blue
                    power suits, wielding a handbag, her hair lacquered into
                    immobile submission, her earlier style solidified into a
                    heavily stylized femininity bordering on drag. Paul Flynn,
                    in a <a
                    href=\"http:\/\/commentisfree.guardian.co.uk\/paul_flynn\/2006\/05\/by_paul_flynn.html\">fairly
                    tortured discussion<\/a> of Thatcher\u2019s status as a gay
                    icon, put it down to her \u2018ability to carry a strong,
                    identifiable, signature look&#8230; an intrinsic and steely
                    power to self-transform\u2019, and a \u2018camp, easily
                    cartooned presence\u2019. The startling evocative power of
                    this look, its ability to summon up its host of contemporary
                    social, cultural and political associations, is why I jump
                    when Streep&#8217;s replication of it intrudes into my
                    vision. It\u2019s like being repeatedly sideswiped by the
                    1980s, which is something the last UK election had already
                    made me thoroughly sick of.<\/p>\n

                    Thatcher\u2019s, usually as part of left-wing critiques
                    meant to signify the closeness of their policies to hers.
                    Thatcher\u2019s image is here used as an instantly
                    recognisable political signifier, communicating a set of
                    ideological ideas in a single package, as well as a
                    self-contained political warning sign.<\/p>\n

                    Although the kind of passive objectification associated with
                    Monroe might seem at odds with the idea of Thatcher as a
                    great historical actor with narrative agency in her own
                    right, the images of both women are used in a cultural
                    tradition in which the female figure in particular becomes a
                    canvas for the expression of abstract ideas (think justice,
                    liberty, victory). The abstract embodiment of multiple
                    meanings, and the strategic performance of traditional ideas
                    of femininity, constitute sources of power which Thatcher
                    and her political and media allies exploited to the hilt in
                    their harnessing of support for the policies she
                    promoted.<\/p>\n
