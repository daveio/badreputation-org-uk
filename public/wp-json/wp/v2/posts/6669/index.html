    ><strong
      >Juliet E McKenna<\/strong> is a British writer of fantasy fiction, with
      several published series to her name. She is currently writing her new
      trilogy,
      <strong
        >The Hadrumal Crisis<\/strong>, which begins with
        <strong
          >Dangerous Waters<\/strong>, out now.<br \ />\n<\/em><br \ />\nKings
          and princes, wizards and heroes &#8211; isn\u2019t that what
          fantasy\u2019s all about? Look at the great epics of yore and see
          Gilgamesh, Achilles, Hector, Odysseus, Aeneas, Beowulf, Arthur,
          Lancelot, Roland, Siegfried. Look at the development of the fantasy
          genre and see Conan, Aragorn, Elric, Druss, Belgarion. Such lists are
          endless &#8211; and all male.<\/p>\n
          <p>
            But why should this concern us? There are women in these stories;
            Helen, Hecuba, Penelope, Dido, Lavinia, Guinevere, Morgan le Fay,
            Isolde, Galadriel, Arwen, Polgara, Ce\u2019Nedra. Their presence
            offers the necessary balance, and if the characters who drive the
            plot are predominately male, that\u2019s just a traditional aspect
            of this genre which does reflect so much history. Before the last
            few decades, women were subject to male authority for centuries. No
            one\u2019s saying that women shouldn\u2019t be equal in the real
            world nowaday, but this is fiction after all. Right?<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>No, wrong, and for a whole lot of reasons.<\/p>\n</p>
          <p>
            Let\u2019s start with the historical basis. Granted, the history
            read by
            <strong
              >JRR Tolkien<\/strong> and his generation was all about the great
              deeds of great (white) men. Such interpretations reflected the
              Victorian worldview of masculine authority and responsibility.
              That immediately creates problems. When the importance of great
              men is taken for granted, that\u2019s where the historian\u2019s
              focus will be. If women are not deemed important, why bother
              writing about them except where they impinge on the main
              subject\u2019s life or deeds? They will inevitably end up absent
              from the narrative that emerges.<\/p>\n
              <p>
                Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. That was then,
                and this is now. Since the first emergence of women\u2019s
                studies as a discipline in the 1960s, a wealth of historical
                research has explored the role of women in all levels of
                society. Women\u2019s influence and significance is now
                apparent, even when they were effectively denied financial and
                political power by the cultures of their day.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                So a fantasy writer can no longer point to a few exceptional
                women in fantasy narratives, such as <a
                href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Galadriel\">Galadriel<\/a>,
                and hide behind a claim to reflect historical accuracy because
                the only significant women in history were exceptions such as
                Good Queen Bess. Not when I have books on my study shelves about
                the women who sailed with Nelson\u2019s navy and built his ships
                in the royal dockyards, about the role of so many women in the
                scientific developments of the Enlightenment and a whole lot
                more besides.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>

                height=\"300\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/a>Women\u2019s roles
                in all facets of life are now being acknowledged. These women
                had authority and autonomy. Granted, that was often limited by
                their wealth, social status and culture, but there is no excuse
                for women characters in fantasy fiction only ever being passive
                and reactive. Historically we now know that women were rarely
                only defined by their relationships with men in the way that so
                many women characters in fantasy have been. While women can be
                wives, mothers or lovers, benign or malicious, that is assuredly
                not all they can be. Fantasy fiction should reflect such current
                historical research, not attitudes that were outdated fifty
                years ago.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                Because fiction is important. Stories have always been one of
                the primary means of education and instruction, from the very
                young on into adulthood. Look at any list of best-sellers for
                teens and you will see how fantasy fiction dominates.
                Thankfully, writers like the late <a
                href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Diana_Wynne_Jones\"><strong
                  >Diana Wynne Jones<\/strong><\/a> and <a
                  href=\"http:\/\/www.philip-pullman.com\/\"><strong
                    >Philip Pullman<\/strong><\/a> have been writing stories for
                    decades encouraging children to explore and debate the
                    worldviews that might be imposed upon them, along with the
                    roles they\u2019re expected to fill and the authority which
                    adults might claim.<\/p>\n
                    <p>
                      So it\u2019s vital that epic fantasies on the
                      \u2018adult\u2019 shelves don\u2019t undo all that good
                      work. I really do not want my teenage sons unconsciously
                      absorbing notions of male privilege and entitlement in
                      stories where a woman\u2019s importance is always defined
                      by who she might choose to sleep with, or better yet, save
                      her precious virginity for. Where women who transgress
                      male authority are invariably punished by supposedly
                      indifferent twists of fate. I don\u2019t want my niece and
                      god-daughters reading stories which imply that true
                      happiness lies in meekness, submission and doing the
                      cooking and mending to facilitate so much more valuable
                      male heroics.<\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Not when so much of today\u2019s baser popular culture
                      looks so indulgently on misogynistic male
                      \u2018celebrities\u2019, excusing infidelity or excess at
                      the same time as subjecting women in the public eye to
                      merciless, puritanical scrutiny while extolling the role
                      of Wife And\/Or Girlfriend to a rich man as the pinnacle
                      of female achievement. Not when pay gaps and glass
                      ceilings and the Old Boy network are still so insidiously
                      prevalent.<\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I want all those teenagers to read stories where male and
                      female characters are equally significant in the
                      narrative, all making the best use of their respective
                      talents and abilities, where their gender is only
                      influential when such things as physical strength come
                      into play. Is that realistic or just more fantasy?
                      Perhaps, but another facet of fiction has always been
                      encouraging aspiration.<\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Thankfully there have long been fantasies with strong
                      female characters taking the initiative to drive plots
                      forward, making their own choices and dealing with men as
                      equals, even when their cultures frown upon it. <a

                                  <p>
                                    But this is still not enough. Those writers
                                    are all women, and research has shown that
                                    men and boys\u2019 reading is so often
                                    unconsciously biased towards books written
                                    by men. The representation of women in
                                    fantasy is an issue that should concern all
                                    authors. We need a substantial list of male
                                    authors to cite after
                                    <strong
                                      >Sir Terry Pratchett<\/strong>, when the
                                      question of men writing effective,

                                      <p>
                                        I want to read those stories myself. But
                                        this doesn\u2019t mean I want to read
                                        about feisty servant girls who wake up,
                                        throw off a lifetime of cultural

                                        feminism. Any more than I want to read
                                        about honest farm boys who discover
                                        they\u2019re a lost heir and regain the

                                        representation of women in fantasy must
                                        still include women leading
                                        circumscribed, subordinated lives, to
                                        remind all of us reading, male and
                                        female, why our grandmothers, mothers
                                        and aunts campaigned for the vote and
                                        marched for equal rights. To remind us
                                        what women\u2019s lives are like today
                                        in so much of the world where their
                                        human rights are curtailed by culture
                                        and poverty. And of course, so many
                                        similar arguments apply when we consider
                                        the equally problematic question of
                                        characters of colour in fantasy
                                        fiction.<\/p>\n
                                      </p>

                                        Doesn\u2019t this all sound so worthy
                                        and politically correct? Oh dear,
                                        because so often that means just plain
                                        dull. The most tedious storybooks which
                                        I read to my children were the ones with
                                        An Improving Moral Message. Some of the
                                        most boring news reports are the ones
                                        analysing sexism, racism, any other
                                        \u2013ism you care to name. That
                                        doesn\u2019t mean these issues
                                        aren\u2019t important but it can be such
                                        hard work to stop your eyes glazing
                                        over&#8230;<\/p>\n

                                        True, and this is another reason why the
                                        representation of women in fantasy
                                        fiction is so important, alongside that
                                        of other minorities who\u2019ve been
                                        historically marginalised and abused.
                                        Because epic fantasy fiction, with its
                                        traditional high heroics, hair\u2019s
                                        breadth escapes, valorous last stands,
                                        black-hearted villainy, the tragedy of
                                        good men in conflict, and yes,
                                        star-crossed lovers here and there, will
                                        be read and enjoyed by all sorts of
                                        people who would never sit through an
                                        earnest documentary or read a lengthy
                                        newspaper analysis.<\/p>\n
