    <p>A confession: I write fanfiction.<\/p>\n</p>
    <p>
      I\u2019ll let that sink in for a moment, whilst you judge me and leap to
      all the usual conclusions. At least half of them will be reasonably
      correct.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      For starters, let\u2019s clear up some myths. Fanfiction isn\u2019t about
      porn. Or, at least, it isn\u2019t
      <em
        >all<\/em> about porn. There are as many different genres out there as
        there are genres of fiction, as many reasons for reading and writing it
        as there are readers and writers of it. And it isn\u2019t exactly an
        obscure pastime; on fanfiction.net (the largest, if most mainstream and
        therefore frowned-upon collection of fanfic) there are 593,713 fics
        listed under the Harry Potter category alone.<\/p>\n

          (jcarlosn)<\/p><\/div>Yet despite its wide appeal, fanfiction is seen
          as the dark side of geek fandom. Widely derided, it\u2019s dismissed
          as the home of squeeing fangirls high on sugar and manga, or else of
          hopeless deviants: furries, kink-seekers and the downright filthy.
          Both of these are, technically, perfectly accurate. Fanfiction gets a
          bad rep, as do its advocates, and honestly &#8211; there&#8217;s good
          reason for that. A lot of it is absolutely terrible (the infamous <a
          href=\"http:\/\/knowyourmeme.com\/memes\/my-immortal-the-worst-fanfiction-ever\">My
          Immortal<\/a>, for example), and a lot of it&#8217;s cringeworthy
          wish-fulfilment crawling with <a
          href=\"http:\/\/tvtropes.org\/pmwiki\/pmwiki.php\/Main\/MarySue\">Mary
          Sues<\/a>. But to pretend that that\u2019s
          <em
            >all<\/em> it is, is to do it a huge disservice.<\/p>\n
            <p>
              Here\u2019s one of my favourite quotes about it, used by Sheenagh
              Pugh in her book <a
              href=\"http:\/\/sheenagh.webs.com\/thedemocraticgenre.htm\"><strong
                >The Democratic Genre: Fanfiction in a Literary
                Context<\/strong><\/a>:<\/p>\n
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    It&#8217;s always been high praise in Fannish circles to be
                    told that you wrote a story so good it should be published,
                    but sometimes, the highest praise is that it can&#8217;t be.
                    Its very uniqueness, what creates it, makes it impossible to
                    be anything else. Lots of people can write stories that fall
                    into readable (more than you think, actually, but I&#8217;m
                    flexible on the idea of readable), and many can write
                    stories I&#8217;d pay to read, and even some write stories
                    that could be published and be great. But there&#8217;s this
                    small, fascinating group that write a story that belongs
                    only to the fandom that created it. It&#8217;s like having a
                    treasure you never have to share. It wraps itself in the
                    canon and fanon and the author&#8217;s own mind that created
                    it and takes it as its own so perfectly that you are so damn
                    glad you went into that fandom, just grateful, just
                    absolutely thrilled, because you get to read
                    this.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Every fic, without exception, is a product of its fandom.
                    Reading a fic is not just reading a simple story: what
                    you\u2019re actually reading is an intertwining of fanlore,
                    mixing in-jokes and terminology from one particular fandom,
                    as well as from the broader history and narrative of fandom.
                    That\u2019s why they can appear so incoherent and ridiculous
                    to the outside world at times. Fanfiction authors are less
                    writing a story than weaving together a cultural
                    tapestry.<\/p>\n
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Fanfiction has a proud and noble tradition, as anyone
                    entrenched within the community will tell you. Every student
                    of fanlore knows where the term <a
                    href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Shipping_(fandom)\">\u201cship\u201d<\/a>
                    arose (<strong
                      >X Files<\/strong> fandom), and where the term <a
                      href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Slash_fiction\">\u201cslash\u201d<\/a>
                      arose (<strong
                        >Star Trek<\/strong> fandom). We have our own history;
                        from the pre-internet fanzines, to early Usenet groups,
                        right through to the great shipping wars of
                        <strong
                          >Harry Potter<\/strong> and the arguments over whether
                          RPF (Real Person Fic; fanfiction about
                          \u201creal\u201d people) is morally acceptable (the
                          earliest known concrete example of RPF comes from the
                          Bronte sisters, who used to write reams of stuff about
                          the <a
                          href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gondal_(fictional_country)\">fictional
                          country of Gondal<\/a>. It can be easily argued that
                          there was a huge amount of RPF within the oral
                          tradition, as people passed down stories about
                          folkloric legends such as Robin Hood, King Arthur, and
                          &#8211; yeah, I\u2019m going to go there &#8211;
                          Jesus). We know our lore and our mythology and our
                          terminology, and we study it as arduously as disciples
                          of any other body of text.<\/p>\n
                          <p>
                            Whilst I do stress that a lot of fanfiction out
                            there is non-sexual and non-romantic in content
                            (it\u2019s called <a
                            href=\"http:\/\/tvtropes.org\/pmwiki\/pmwiki.php\/Main\/GenFic\">gen
                            fic<\/a>, yo, look it up), there\u2019s an
                            inarguable trend towards sexytimes. I\u2019m all
                            down with that; I like a bit of story with my porn,
                            and I\u2019m not a very visual person, so fanfiction
                            is where I discovered a lot about myself and my own
                            sexuality. I think I started reading fanfiction when
                            I was about 13 or 14, and nowhere near, ahem,
                            \u201cactive\u201d. My first ever ship was Rupert
                            Giles\/Jenny Calendar. It was a while after that
                            until I discovered slash, although that discovery
                            was, frankly, inevitable \u2013 I had a bit of a
                            sweet-tooth for Harry\/Draco (Drarry, if you will).
                            Fanfiction was (and still is!) a safe space to
                            explore my own sexuality, and discover the
                            kaleidoscope of sexualities, genders and identities
                            that are out there. It was many years before
                            I\u2019d hear the name Judith Butler, or even hear
                            the slightest mention of \u2018queer theory\u2019,
                            but when I did, none of the ideas seemed
                            particularly new to me.<\/p>\n
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Whilst there are plenty of male writers of
                            fanfiction (especially within the gaming community
                            &#8211; shout out to my little bro!) authorship is
                            overwhelmingly female, and I don\u2019t think that
                            that\u2019s a coincidence. Out in the real world,
                            it\u2019s difficult to own our own sexuality;
                            there\u2019s simply no room for shades of grey.
                            You\u2019re either frigid or a slut; you\u2019re
                            either straight or gay; your sexuality and identity
                            is whatever people perceive when they look at you.
                            But within the fanfiction community, away from the
                            patriarchal mainstream, we can discover and explore
                            how we feel about our own sexual and gender and
                            personal identity. That\u2019s something that I
                            think has had more effect on my life than anything
                            else. Through the medium of fandom, we can find out
                            who we are, and what we like, and how we feel, all
                            through just reading stories together. And then
                            hopefully &#8211; eventually &#8211; we get to write
                            our own story.<\/p>\n
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            This is people writing because they love it, for no
                            purpose other than writing for themselves and for
                            other people who they vaguely know on the internet.
                            It\u2019s done purely for the joy of the thing. And
                            it isn&#8217;t just about the fic itself; the fandom
                            community is the most genre-savvy, theory-aware,
                            innovative group of people I\u2019ve ever had the
                            pleasure to tangle with. This is a community alive
                            with discussion about narrative, metanarrative,
                            referentialism &#038; self referentialism, literary
                            theory, gender and sexuality, social justice,
                            morality, pop culture and in-jokes. I\u2019d also
                            argue that it\u2019s an innately queer community; it
                            not only exists between the cracks, but thrives on
                            the cracks. And in a world where deconstruction and
                            theory are often frowned upon as &#8220;thinking
                            about things too much&#8221;, fandom is where I
                            found a home.<\/p>\n
