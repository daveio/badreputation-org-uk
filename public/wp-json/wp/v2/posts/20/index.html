              <blockquote>
                <p>
                  Equality is not a concept. It\u2019s not something we should
                  be striving for. It\u2019s a necessity. Equality is like
                  gravity, we need it to stand on this earth as men and women
                  &#8211; and the misogyny that is in every culture is not a
                  true part of the human condition. It is life out of balance,
                  and that imbalance is sucking something out of the soul of
                  every man and woman who\u2019s confronted with
                  it.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  These two quotes sum up why I\u2019m a feminist. Equality is
                  not optional. I\u2019m intelligent enough, and live in a
                  society educated enough, that there is no excuse for me not to
                  aim for it. Without equality, we fail as human
                  beings.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_89\" style=\"width: 310px\"

                  This type of \u201cequality\u201d is not some iron-clad
                  regulation of behaviour, but an equal chance to live as you
                  choose to: not to be disadvantaged because assumptions are
                  made about one of two categories (which don&#8217;t match the
                  multiple physical or mental possibilities anyway). Not
                  pressured to act a certain way, or locked out from having
                  power over your life. And it&#8217;s not some unimportant
                  dream of abstract perfection but the most fundamental part of
                  the lives of millions.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  Reaching this fabled Equality won\u2019t solve many problems.
                  Those people lucky enough to escape poverty will still need to
                  work every day, death is still inevitable, resources are still
                  finite. If we had a much-reduced need for feminism, we\u2019d
                  only be
                  <em
                    >starting<\/em> on the struggle for a better society &#8211;
                    but we wouldn\u2019t be dooming over half our population to
                    lesser chances and consideration because they don\u2019t
                    have man-parts.<\/p>\n
                    <p>
                      Of course, aiming for true equality and overcoming the
                      prejudices which are deeply ingrained in our (somewhat
                      twisted) upbringings is difficult even for feminists. I
                      wonder whether giving up my seat on the train for a woman
                      is deeply offensive and sexist, because it\u2019s based on
                      the idea that women are weak creatures to be treasured and
                      looked after by big strong men. I start to examine
                      <em
                        >every single decision I make<\/em> that is based on the
                        line \u201cbecause she\u2019s a woman\u201d. In a
                        society where equality was real, that reason would
                        virtually never apply.<\/p>\n
                        <p>
                          For most roles, if gender is the only difference
                          between two people then they should be
                          interchangeable. A decision should immediately be
                          about the positives and negatives of the individual
                          instead. By having true equality, you would be free to
                          see the person for who they are \u2013 at the very
                          least, THEY would be free to choose who they are
                          without having it dictated because of what society
                          thinks \u201cwomen\u201d are\/deserve this
                          year.<\/p>\n
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          But instead girls still get pink dolls and boys get
                          blue trucks.<\/p>\n
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          It&#8217;s not unrealistic to have true equality as
                          the eventual aim. In fact, it makes identifying the
                          current inequality all the easier: endless shelves of
                          women&#8217;s magazines full of airbrushed anorexics,
                          and also full shelves of men&#8217;s mags featuring
                          topless women all with identical body shapes&#8230; if
                          we were surrounded by constant images of
                          perfectly-toned half naked men with impossible
                          airbrushed bodies on every second billboard and
                          magazine cover instead, you have to wonder how long
                          this shit would last.<\/p>\n

                                    rep with a lot of men. When I linked to this

                                    said they found the idea of male feminists
                                    &#8220;somewhat absurd&#8221;. That&#8217;s
