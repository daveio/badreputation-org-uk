  If you\u2019re wondering why I have been suspiciously silent over the last few
  weeks, rest easy. I\u2019ve been preparing to sit my driving test by not
  killing people on a weekly basis.<\/p>\n

  \/><\/a>The first person I didn\u2019t kill was the bloke in the angry Merc
  behind me, who decided to respond to a downpour in London rush hour traffic by
  tailgating a car sporting L-plates and stalling at tricky junctions. I
  don\u2019t understand the mindset of people like this. There you are, in your
  <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/2011\/03\/18\/secret-diary-of-a-female-petrolhead-the-supercar-edition\/\">expensive
  and pointless<\/a> car (because who cares about 0-60 when you\u2019re gonna be
  doing 0-10 at most, and wearing out your left foot), and you think,
  \u201cHmmm, yes. I think my car could do with having a little more Fiat
  inserted up its nostrils.\u201d So you start breathing down the neck of a tiny
  little 500 with a driver who clearly has yet to master indicators. Or the
  clutch. Or \u2013 worryingly \u2013 the handbrake.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  It was worse with the second person I didn\u2019t kill. That was me, by the
  way. It was a few weeks later, with the indicators now mastered but the
  elusive handbrake still outfoxing me at every turn. I turned right, as I am
  often instructed to do, and did NOT get rammed in the passenger side by
  on-coming traffic. I declared the turn a success, and exited the main road,
  entering the right-hand street, which had a rather steep gradient, almost
  hill-like in its ferocity.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>At the top of the hill was a van.<\/p>\n</p>
<p>
  We are all familiar with Van Man. He cat-calls with the firm conviction that
  he is somehow brightening up your day. He plays obnoxiously loud music and
  makes racist remarks, happy in the belief that he represents The Real England,
  whatever that might be. He also never \u2013 ever \u2013 gives way.
  Ever.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  Spare a thought for the state of my pants when I saw Van Man accelerating down
  that hill towards me.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  At my left was a car. At my right was a tiny narrow spare, then another car.
  Behind me was a busy main road. And in front of me was my rapidly-approaching
  death, in the form of a van so big it wouldn\u2019t even see my tiny little
  Fiat before it squashed it like a bug. A small, white, L-plated bug.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  At the very last second, when my eyes were like saucers and I was seriously
  regretting not having sorted that sodding will, he veered off into the tiny
  gap on my right. He didn\u2019t even clip my car (although the car on the
  other side may not have been so lucky). By all accounts he didn\u2019t even
  notice that he had nearly caused vehicular dismemberment.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  \u201cWell,\u201d my instructor said brightly, after a horrifying and awkward
  pause, \u201cshall we get on, then?\u201d<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  Needless to say, I nearly burst into tears. \u201cWhat the hell was that? That
  was like a cartoon death! I don\u2019t want to die a cartoon death! I
  don\u2019t want to be killed by a flying piano or a toilet seat, or a giant
  truck that doesn\u2019t see me and runs me over!\u201d<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d my instructor soothed, looking a little rattled
  himself. \u201cThat sort of thing doesn\u2019t actually happen in real
  life.\u201d<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  That thought gave me pause. I wondered what, precisely, he thought we were
  doing right now. Maybe it was a rehearsal for real life? Maybe real motoring
  wouldn\u2019t be like this. Maybe \u2013 and here was a horrifying possibility
  \u2013 it would be

    <p>It was.<\/p>\n</p>
    <p>
      Over the next few weeks I\u2019ve had parking spaces stolen by aggressive
      BMWs that more or less manhandled me out of the way, I\u2019ve nearly been
      killed by drivers doing 40 in a 20mph zone down a sodding bus lane during
      restrictions, I\u2019ve nearly squashed toddlers that decided to run out
      into the middle of the road while their parents looked on, oblivious, and
      \u2013 worst of all \u2013 I once nudged the rear bumper of another car.
      It was at less than 1mph and left no physical mark whatsoever, but I
      maintain that the psychological scarring will stay with me.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      My conclusion is this: you would have to be absolutely mad to want to
      drive in London. You have nowhere to park, and everywhere there are people
      that view red lights as simply suggestions, bus lanes as express lanes,
      and children as speed bumps. If you are a woman in a small car, every
      large car will attempt to physically crowd you off the road, and if you
      are a woman in a large car, everyone will hate you because you are clearly
      being overly aggressive in daring to get behind the wheel of something
      bigger than an armchair.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>And yet.<\/p>\n</p>
    <p>
      I loved that stupid little Fiat. I called it Bertie, and the moment it was
      named, it leaped about like an eager little puppy. I did a little dance of
      triumph on discovering that my turns in the road were textbook-perfect,
      and that parallel parking really isn\u2019t all that bad. True, my
      instructor was a closet sadist who decided to make things \u2018more
      interesting\u2019 by making me do obscenely complicated compound
      manoeuvres \u2013 reversing around a corner with obstacles and a time
      limit springs to mind \u2013 but once you choose to view the whole thing
      as an elaborate obstacle course, it\u2019s fine. And the little Fiat 500
      made me feel ridiculously proud of myself every time I got behind the
      wheel. Look at me, I\u2019m
      <em
        >driving<\/em>!<\/p>\n
        <p>
          It\u2019s a shame it had to end. All things must, I suppose, but it
          made me tear up a little bit just the same to walk around to the
          passenger side and get in, knowing that this would be it. The thing
          about driving tests is, no one tells you that you don\u2019t get to
          have any more lessons after you pass.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          Bye bye, Bertie. You were a smart little car and you took a lot of
          abuse. I\u2019ll come visit you over the summer for my advanced
          driving course.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          In the meantime, though, I\u2019m going to look up Bertie\u2019s sexy
          two-wheel cousin and sit my <a
          href=\"http:\/\/www.direct.gov.uk\/en\/Motoring\/LearnerAndNewDrivers\/RidingMotorcyclesAndMopeds\/DG_4022430\">CBT<\/a>.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          After all, what\u2019s the point of a driving license if you only get
          to drive cars? There\u2019s a motorbike out there with my name on
          it.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_6362\" style=\"width: 310px\"
