<p>
  So, here are three recent-ish comics, one good, one with potential but some
  issues, and one of them so eye-meltingly bad that quite possibly I am a worse
  person for having read it.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  So, let\u2019s start with the bad, because that\u2019s where the fun is,
  right? Right.<\/p>\n

      A four part mini-series that wrapped up just recently,
      <strong
        >Neonomicon<\/strong> was\u2026 well, it was, as much as we might wish
        it hadn\u2019t been. A modern spin on Lovecraft\u2019s Cthulu Mythos,
        <strong
          >Neonomicon<\/strong> actually looked like it had potential to start
          with. A good Mythos tale lures you in with mundane normality and then
          \u2013 bam! \u2013 unspeakable eldritch abomination and the creeping
          madness behind your eyes. In a similar way,
          <strong
            >Neonomicon<\/strong> lures you in with a clever enough idea and
            characters and then \u2013 bam! \u2013 racism and gang rape.
            We\u2019ll get to that in a moment.<\/p>\n
            <p>
              So, that acceptable start we mentioned. We\u2019re given a pair of
              FBI agents investigating some strange goings on that very quickly
              become Mythos related. And hey, we think, the two lead characters
              are not square jawed white guys. We\u2019ve got a female lead and
              a black male lead, nice to see some variety in character design
              for a change. Sure, some of the Lovecraft references are a bit
              heavy handed, but that\u2019s okay.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              And then the second issue happens. Our two agents have followed
              the lead to a Mythos sex shop in a quiet New England town.
              It\u2019s not sure whether it wants to be creepy or played for
              laughs with some of the novelty items visible in the background.
              One thing leads to another, and they\u2019re infiltrating a sex
              cult and\u2026 oh, now the guy has been shot, and the racial slurs
              are flowing freely. And now it\u2019s gang rape time for the
              female agent. Thanks for that, Alan Moore.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, Moore did say (there&#8217;s a quote in <a
              href=\"http:\/\/www.theskinny.co.uk\/article\/100258-choose-your-reality-alan-moore-unearthed\">this
              interview here<\/a>) that when he was writing this he thought
              (paraphrased): \u201c&#8230;let\u2019s put all of the unpleasant
              racial stuff back in, let\u2019s put sex back in.\u201d And that
              could have been interesting, handled differently. It could have
              been a chance to tackle some of the issues with Lovecraft, to look
              at the fact that Lovecraft was a bit of a terrible racist and
              misogynist. But that isn\u2019t what happens here. This isn\u2019t
              a story that uses sex and racism to raise questions and make a
              point. It\u2019s just a story full of non-consensual sex and
              racism. Or, as a friend put it: &#8220;If God were to look down
              upon this benighted planet in judgement, he\u2019d probably think
              the place worthy of a second chance. Until he read<strong>
                Neonomicon<\/strong>. Then he\u2019d remember why he
                commissioned the Book of Revelation in the first
                place.&#8221;<\/p>\n

                        >Carbon Grey<\/strong> is our \u201chas potential, but
                        also issues\u201d. Let\u2019s look at the potential
                        first.<\/p>\n
                        <p>
                          Set in a slightly steampunky spin on First World
                          War-era Europe, the story follows the Sisters Grey.
                          Each generation, we\u2019re told, see three sisters
                          born to the Grey family, hereditary defenders of the
                          Kaiser. Three sisters, one for strength, one for
                          grace, one for wisdom. Except in this generation,
                          where the youngest sister has a twin, a fourth Grey, a
                          sister for revolution.<\/p>\n
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          What does this get us? It gets us explosions, and
                          action, and the four very deadly Sisters Grey kicking
                          ass and changing the face of politics in Mitteleuropa.
                          It gets us spies and assassins and clever dialogue.
                          And did I mention the ass-kicking? In the opening
                          sequence of the first issue the youngest Grey pulls
                          off more awesome action stuff than can be found in an
                          entire
                          <strong
                            >Die Hard<\/strong> marathon.<\/p>\n
                            <p>
                              The issues, then? Well, mostly it revolves around
                              one thing: the art (which for the most part is
                              very, very pretty, as long as you don\u2019t mind
                              the manga influences). With one notable exception
                              in the form of a background character with no
                              lines, all the female characters have essentially
                              the same body type. It\u2019s that improbable
                              superhero-woman build, all gravity defying breasts
                              and waist lines that surely don\u2019t leave
                              enough room for internal organs. The Queen of
                              Germany lounges around in a scrap of white fabric
                              that\u2019d make Emma Frost blush.<\/p>\n
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              The intro arc has just wrapped up, so now\u2019s a
                              good time to get in on the main story of Carbon
                              Grey, if you can look past the art
                              problems.<\/p>\n
                            </p>
                            <p>And now, on to the good.<\/p>\n</p>

                                    <p>
                                      Scarlet was a regular hipster kid in
                                      Portland, just generally existing. Then
                                      things went wrong and she learnt a harsh
                                      lesson in how messed up the world is. Now
                                      she\u2019s running a grass-roots
                                      revolution. That\u2019s the basic gist of
                                      the series. Oh, and she wants your help
                                      and is telling the whole story via
                                      fourth-wall breaking narration. Between
                                      some excellent lines and a fantastic
                                      snapshot life sketch in the first issue,
                                      we get Scarlet as a nicely well-developed
                                      character, someone we can accept as
                                      real.<\/p>\n
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                      It\u2019s an interesting look at what it
                                      takes to shake someone out of their
                                      comfortable middle-class white comfort
                                      zone, and what they do next. And with
                                      everything being told to us via Scarlet,
                                      who very definitely has an agenda, we get
                                      to see how bias colours perception. The
                                      police and politicians aren\u2019t all
                                      corrupt and evil, but seen through
                                      Scarlet\u2019s eyes they become
                                      significantly darker. These aren\u2019t
                                      events as they are, they\u2019re events as
                                      one person believes they are. And I\u2019m
                                      a sucker for an unreliable
                                      narrator.<\/p>\n

                                      The art serves as a distinct counterpoint

                                        They dress, move and talk like real
                                        people. This is perhaps not surprising,
                                        given that (long-time Bendis
