        Tomorrow, we&#8217;ll conclude the discussion that first post has

            LARP is sexist in the same way that many things we can know and
            touch in our society are sexist. It&#8217;s a broad sweep to say it
            is primarily played by white, male, ostensibly middle class
            individuals often lacking in social skills and hygiene, and
            it&#8217;s increasingly not true or fair to do so.<\/p>\n

                  >Camarilla\/Vampire LARP<\/strong>. I&#8217;ve been LARPing
                  for about 11 years now. It&#8217;s probably also appropriate
                  to point out that I am a cis male and therefore I won&#8217;t
                  experience sexism &#8211; at least, not in any way comparable
                  to most female players. <\/p>\n
                  <p>
                    LARP is, primarily, a male-dominated game &#8211; just on
                    the basis of who attends. Women can and do come and play,
                    but as Al notes in his post, it is often (though not
                    exclusively) as tag-along girlfriend characters. Women who
                    subvert this and succeed in the game, whilst sometimes
                    respected, often become more of a target for
                    &#8220;PVP&#8221; (&#8220;player versus player&#8221;
                    conflict) than male players succeeding in the same manner,
                    simply because they&#8217;ve deviated from an assigned
                    social position.<\/p>\n
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a highly anecdotal and unscientific manner I&#8217;m now
                    going to list a few instances of sexist and\/or straight up
                    misogynist behaviour I&#8217;ve witnessed whilst LARPing.
                    I&#8217;m listing them because I feel they most accurately
                    depict common manifestations of sexism within LARP, and I
                    promise they&#8217;re all true. They&#8217;re absolutely not
                    true of every male player, but they do definitely exist and
                    they&#8217;re not rare like a dinosaur. They&#8217;re also
                    not especially true of one system over another. <\/p>\n

                    &#8220;Humour&#8221; and Misogyny<\/h3>\n
                    <p>
                      First off, myself and a NPC (non-player character) were
                      standing around during a major Lorien Trust game watching
                      people walk by. Half a dozen teenage girls in ballgowns
                      walked past us. They were pretty smiley and seemed to be
                      having a laugh in the sunshine.<\/p>\n
                    </p>

                      <strong
                        >NPC:<\/strong> Aww, look at them! Don&#8217;t they look
                        all bless and nice!<br \ />\n<strong
                          >Me:<\/strong> Aww, yeah!<br \ />\n<strong
                            >NPC:<\/strong> Fair play though, as soon as they
                            hit the stroke of 16 they&#8217;re going to get the
                            living fuck raped out of them.<br \ />\n<strong
                              >Me:<\/strong> WTF?!<\/p>\n
                              <p>
                                The untyped climax of this story is that I said
                                that this was not a cool or acceptable thing to
                                say, and I did not think it was on. It had
                                definitely been said in such a way as to suggest
                                that such abuse would be quite desirable\/fun
                                were it to take place. My reaction caused a
                                significant souring of attitude towards me both
                                from the individual I had this exchange with and
                                also from the people generally around this
                                person &#8211; it was felt that I was making a
                                fuss over nothing and should just &#8220;take a
                                joke&#8221;. I&#8217;ve heard similar comments
                                from other individuals and small groups, as far
                                as I can remember though only when there was no
                                female player or female member of staff around
                                to overhear.<\/p>\n
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                I can also cite numerous cases where a
                                &#8220;provocatively&#8221; dressed female
                                player was scorned and massively disparaged for
                                &#8220;being a slag&#8221;. This often seems
                                especially likely to happen if she has achieved
                                some kind of success in the game, and
                                it&#8217;ll range from jokes about what
                                &#8220;whorish behaviour&#8221; must have taken
                                place to get said advantages to just straight up

                                        out of being killed because she&#8217;s

                                          This sort of shared humour goes way
                                          beyond risky &#8220;laddish&#8221;

                                          in some cases actively steps towards
                                          hate. It also suggests that actual

                                          less extreme than the above &#8211; is

                                                  I&#8217;ve seen happen at LRP
                                                  events, but there&#8217;s also
                                                  milder general and casual
                                                  sexism. Pleasingly, this
                                                  sometimes goes wrong. About
                                                  two years ago I was at an
                                                  event where four very hard,
                                                  very killy male combat
                                                  characters all died from

                                                  female character served them
                                                  from a bottle of mead when she
                                                  came into their camp. This is

                                                  are often stupid, and many

                                                  utilising sexism in this way
                                                  that can be done by women at

                                                  being able to play the same
                                                  game as male players, on top

                                                  distasteful or not. Some

                                                  slightly) both ways: as a male
                                                  player, I&#8217;ve played
                                                  character types who were meant
                                                  to be without gender or
                                                  sexuality and found that some
                                                  female players attempted to
                                                  use what I&#8217;ve perceived
                                                  as out-of-character flirting
                                                  when interacting with me,
                                                  probably because as a male
                                                  player I&#8217;m perceived as
                                                  potentially at least a bit
                                                  sexist in my behaviour. A more
                                                  advanced manifestation of
                                                  sexism in LARP is what I like
                                                  to think of as
                                                  &#8220;harem&#8221; behaviour.
                                                  This is where a female player
                                                  deliberately cultivates around
                                                  her &#8211; both in and out of
                                                  character &#8211; a small
                                                  collection of young men that
                                                  follow her around and who do
                                                  what she wants &#8211; in a
                                                  way that I think is often
                                                  distinct from simply being a
                                                  female group leader with group
                                                  members who happen to be male.
                                                  I think I can see in this a
                                                  recognition that some women
                                                  feel they can&#8217;t compete
                                                  in the same way as male
                                                  players because of sexist
                                                  attitudes and general

                                                  to cultivate a group of male
                                                  characters to act through
                                                  &#8211; or to provide enough

                                                    I think my main issue and
                                                    argument is that all the
                                                    examples above translate
                                                    neatly across from real
                                                    life. Sexism does happen a
                                                    lot in real life, but there
                                                    is an increasing social and
                                                    political movement backed up
                                                    by law to reduce and prevent
                                                    discrimination. However, in
                                                    a LARP game, there is only
                                                    what players and system are
                                                    prepared to step up against
                                                    and say &#8220;NO&#8221; to.
                                                    There is no standard of
                                                    behaviour that can really be
                                                    expected to be enforced
                                                    beyond the absolutes of
                                                    &#8220;no out of character
                                                    violence&#8221;. This means
                                                    people are free to avoid
                                                    rewarding female characters
                                                    in-game and can also get out
                                                    of taking them seriously. If
                                                    someone behaves in a sexist
                                                    way, people might think less
                                                    of them but often
                                                    there&#8217;s still no

                                                    behaviour that often goes on
                                                    in the field, if it were

                                                    would result in

                                                      with sexism. Male and
                                                      female staff exist in
                                                      senior roles in more and

                                                      It&#8217;s just as unfair

                                                      wouldn&#8217;t be right to

                                                      does not come up. After
                                                      all, it wouldn&#8217;t be

                                                      was always horrible. When
