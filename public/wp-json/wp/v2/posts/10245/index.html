  Less than a day to go to the UK release of the <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.thehungergamesmovie.com\/\"><strong
    >Hunger Games<\/strong><\/a> movie, and frankly it&#8217;s difficult for
    some of us at BadRep Towers to go more than five minutes without starting a
    very excitable conversation about it. After spamming my personal Twitter
    feed so heavily even I began to feel slightly awkward, I dragged two
    interested parties &#8211; writer and <a
    href=\"http:\/\/www.denofgeek.com\">Den of Geek<\/a> founder <a

        This is us revisiting Suzanne Collins&#8217;s books, mainly, and looking
        at the characters we like, and how the books &#8211; for us &#8211;
        jigsaw with other franchises out there. Back in the mists of time, Team
        BadRep&#8217;s Jenni also <a
        href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/2011\/03\/25\/the-girl-who-was-on-fire-reviewing-the-hunger-games\/\">talked

              On Those Triangular Twilight Comparisons<\/h3>\n
              <p>
                <strong
                  >Miranda:<\/strong> I made a blog post the other week <a
                  href=\"http:\/\/www.sparksoflight.org.uk\/2012\/03\/03\/selling-revolution-the-hungermerch-problem\/\">elsewhere
                  on the internets<\/a> about how the movie franchise is being
                  merched, as far as I can tell, in a way which visually
                  dovetails with a lot of Twilight merch, and the disappointment
                  I feel around that. Nonetheless, Suzanne Collins&#8217;s
                  bestselling trilogy is, I think, using the love triangle motif
                  in an effective, nuanced way. So while the
                  <strong
                    >Twilight<\/strong> comparisons might be short-sighted,
                    they&#8217;re not unreasonable. But what do my friends
                    think?<\/p>\n

                        >Bucky:<\/strong> OK, so here&#8217;s my big confession:
                        I sort of love
                        <strong
                          >Twilight<\/strong>. It&#8217;s the reading equivalent
                          of eating popcorn, plus I&#8217;m a sucker for
                          romance, which should be apparent in the fact that
                          even the most depressing things I write <a
                          href=\"http:\/\/buckychainsawmassacre.blogspot.co.uk\/2011\/12\/apocalypse-romance.html\">are
                          always thinly-veiled love stories<\/a>. My beef with
                          <strong
                            >Twilight<\/strong> was the general
                            mormon-propaganda shittiness. I could totally have
                            gone for a general horror-lite romance WITHOUT the
                            abominable gender politics and chastity
                            stuff.<\/p>\n
                            <p>
                              Throughout the first book, it was apparent that
                              this wasn&#8217;t just going to be a vapid
                              romance, which was fine and the nature of pitting
                              them against each other sort of insisted that the
                              romance be downplayed, but across the three books
                              I was disappointed by the things that didn&#8217;t
                              happen &#8211; when the action\/adventure\/1984
                              stuff took over the romantic hook was still what
                              kept me reading!<\/p>\n

                                  >Twilight<\/strong> are kind of irrelevant
                                  here, because they&#8217;re completely
                                  different stories in completely different
                                  genres.

                                    >Twilight<\/strong> is a romance, and

                                      >The Hunger Games<\/strong> is&#8230;
                                      well, anything but that. It&#8217;s an
                                      action\/thriller\/horror with strong
                                      anti-war sentiments, and I think reading
                                      The Hunger Games for the romance is doing
                                      it a massive disservice.<\/p>\n
                                      <p>
                                        In particular, getting overly invested
                                        in the love triangle element is missing
                                        the point, because Gale and Peeta
                                        aren&#8217;t really individuals,
                                        they&#8217;re metaphors.<\/p>\n

                                          comparison, but there&#8217;s no
                                          escaping the Love Triangle parallels,
                                          Collins just uses it as a device to
                                          much greater effect, rather than
                                          pinning an entire series of books on

                                                  me. Because what does Gale
                                                  stand for? Anger. Revenge.
                                                  He&#8217;s a hunter;
                                                  he&#8217;s kind of Old
                                                  Testament-y. He&#8217;s very
                                                  black and white, and not very
                                                  interested in forgiveness.
                                                  He&#8217;s initially presented
                                                  as having the most in common
                                                  with Katniss: they have the
                                                  same background, they live in
                                                  the same area, they look like
                                                  each other, they&#8217;re very
                                                  close friends and their lives
                                                  seem very similar. But even
                                                  right at the beginning,
                                                  she&#8217;s restraining him.
                                                  He&#8217;s shouting about
                                                  rebellion in the woods while
                                                  she tries to calm him down and
                                                  keep him safe. He just gets
                                                  more violent as the books go
                                                  on, and it&#8217;s his bombs
                                                  that kill a bunch of innocent
                                                  children. Gale is basically a
                                                  terrorist, and his is no way
                                                  to build a future.<\/p>\n
