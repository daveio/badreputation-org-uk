      &#8230; a &#8220;feminist self-defence&#8221; class I attended.<\/p>\n
      <p>
        Arriving at Studio La Danza on Holloway Road, walking up the stairs past
        brightly coloured adverts for poledancing and LGBT ballroom dancing
        classes, in the mirror-walled second floor studio I met our smiling
        instructors, Sian and Lydia, two students from Goldsmiths
        College.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        We moved chairs into a circle for a quick discussion about the class,
        and what feminist self-defence actually is, while Sian handed round
        flyers such as &#8216;Your Voice Is A Weapon: How To Use It,&#8217; and
        a cartoon diagram mercilessly depicting the weak, soft, vulnerable parts
        on any attacker.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        Lydia and Sian had learned the techniques they were going to teach us
        when their student feminist society arranged for an instructor from
        Sweden to stage a practical demonstration at Goldsmiths. Feminist
        self-defence is an idea that has especially taken off in Sweden, the
        home of
        <strong
          >The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo<\/strong> and the VPK feminist
          socialist political party, who are calling for feminist self-defence
          to be taught to girls in schools.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1635\"

          <p>
            Feminist self-defence, we were told, is a DIY grassroots movement of
            gender activists teaching simple self-defence techniques,
            &#8220;specifically tailored towards experiences of violence against
            women, trans and queer people.&#8221; We weren&#8217;t going to find
            competition-winning martial arts or &#8216;complicated Houdini style
            escapes&#8217; here; this was about simplicity and practicality,
            using your natural reflexes to quickly get away, and maybe giving
            your attacker an injury or two to remember you by.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            The most important part of this movement, and why I&#8217;d come
            along to the class, was that there would be no victim-blaming here.
            The Ladyfest programme asked
            <em
              >&#8216;Are you sick of being told not to walk on your own at
              night? Tired of hearing that it&#8217;s our fault if we get
              attacked if we&#8217;re alone and it&#8217;s dark?&#8217;
              <\/em>Having had several self-defence instructors who repeated the
              same tired old bullshit of &#8220;Well, I shouldn&#8217;t say this
              really but it&#8217;s their own fault if they get attacked out on
              their own, I know you girls like to look pretty, but&#8230;&#8221;
              and having also been sexually harassed at classes, this class was
              a refreshingly new experience for me.<\/p>\n
              <p>
                For once, there was the acknowledgement that the burden should
                not be on women to protect themselves from rape, that this is
                not how things
                <em
                  >should<\/em> be. One student remembered the time she&#8217;d
                  been heartened to see in her inbox, instead of that cheery
                  chain e-mail of the type we often receive,
                  <em
                    >&#8216;Women: how to protect yourself from rape! (Forward
                    this to all your girlfriends!)&#8217;<\/em>, the variation
                    <em
                      ><a
                      href=\"http:\/\/www.thefword.org.uk\/blog\/2009\/09\/sexual_assault_3\">&#8216;Rape
                      Prevention Tips for Men&#8217;<\/a>.<br \ />\n<\/em><br
                        \
                      />\nWe started the practical part of the class by talking
                      about personal space. How close does someone have to get
                      for us to feel uncomfortable? &#8220;We&#8217;re so polite
                      in this country,&#8221; said Lydia. &#8220;We don&#8217;t
                      complain.&#8221; We discussed how the size of our personal
                      space decreases when we&#8217;re in a crowded area, on the
                      train or at a gig, but what was emphasised was that
                      although its size can change, we&#8217;re still entitled
                      to our own space, and entitled to tell people to get out
                      of it. Lydia and Sian pretended to be confident commuters
                      bumping into us, while we walked around looking shy, and
                      then we switched roles. Less of a &#8216;This Is How You
                      Must Act In Order Not To Be Attacked&#8217; than a lesson
                      in where our personal boundaries lay, and a funny
                      icebreaker for the class when we were allowed to
                      &#8216;get revenge&#8217; and barge into our
                      instructors.<\/p>\n
                      <p>
                        Something that especially impressed me was that our
                        instructors acknowledged how practising for assault can
                        be upsetting &#8211; that people might have
                        traumatically experienced the situations that were being
                        described. Participation in the physical aspect of the
                        class was not compulsory, they told us &#8211; if we
                        felt upset we could go away and come back again and
                        no-one would judge us, and every part of the class was
                        explained to us before we took part.<\/p>\n
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The instructors were even respectful of each
                        other&#8217;s boundaries, and yet the atmosphere in the
                        class was much more lighthearted and pleasant than many
                        self-defence classes that I have attended \u2013
                        \u201cMay I strangle you, Lydia?\u201d \u201cYes you
                        may, Sian,\u201d they laughed. There were horrible
                        people and horrible situations out there, but we had the
                        power to do something about it, and learning these
                        techniques was going to be fun, too.<\/p>\n
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        We practised shouting &#8211; useful for throwing an
                        attacker off balance, alerting others who might help,
                        and also something that can make your strikes stronger
                        and help you to focus, in the manner of the Japanese <a
                        href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kiai\">Kiai<\/a>.
                        Here, Lydia did a pretty scary impression of her Swedish
                        instructor shouting &#8220;Nej!!&#8221; &#8211; I\u2019m
                        surprised no-one came upstairs to see what was
                        happening! &#8211; but we used the English,
                        &#8220;No!&#8221; and practised hitting boxing pads. Our
                        instructors again emphasised how polite we are as women
                        or minorities in this culture, how we&#8217;re afraid of
                        causing a fuss, and how getting past that fear can be
                        one of the best things we can \u2018unlearn\u2019 to
                        keep ourselves safe.<\/p>\n
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        We were afraid to shout at first, but as our inhibitions
                        dropped we became louder and louder. We shouted not
                        once, but twice, and when we struck, we struck twice,
                        because we were told, if possible, \u201cdo it
                        twice,\u201d as that way there&#8217;s more chance of
                        getting a result. If shouting for help, Sian advised us
                        not just to ask but to ask specific people \u2013
                        \u201cHey, you in the red bobble hat, this man
                        won\u2019t take his hand off my leg, please alert the
                        bus driver!\u201d works because picking on individuals
                        is better than asking a crowd, where everyone might
                        assume that someone else will help you.<\/p>\n
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        As an attacker is likely to be physically stronger than
                        their victim (unless the attacker is feeling a tad
                        suicidal), we were told not to wrestle, not to use
                        \u2018might against might,\u2019 but to find weak spots.
                        We looked at the diagrams we\u2019d been shown and
                        practised using the strong parts of our bodies, the
                        heels of our hands, our fists, our feet, against the
                        vulnerable parts of an attacker\u2019s, their shins,
                        their solar plexus, their throat. This wasn\u2019t
                        karate, this wasn\u2019t the Marquess of Queensbury
                        rules, this was fighting dirty, and fighting for your
                        right to go about your life unharmed.<\/p>\n
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Sian and Lydia explained that we weren&#8217;t just
                        practising for that shadowy figure that jumps out of the
                        bushes, we were also practising close-quarters
                        techniques, where you might not have the space to
                        deliver that awesome roundhouse kick you saw on
                        <strong
                          >Buffy the Vampire Slayer,<\/strong> because sexual
                          assault is much more likely to come from people we
                          know (friends, acquaintances, dates) than from
                          strangers, and can happen just as easily in your
                          house, on your sofa, as in a dark alley somewhere.
                          This is where a lot of the anti-rape advice given by
                          many self-defence instructors falls down! It\u2019s no
                          good saying \u2018don\u2019t walk alone at night\u2019
                          when it could be your date who attacks you.<\/p>\n
                          <p>
                            My one criticism of this class would be that they
                            could have explained a little more about the
                            specific experiences of queer and transgender
                            people, as these were mentioned on the programme,
                            but as a one-hour starter class it was full of
                            great, general advice for people from all walks of
                            life on how to avoid sexual or violent assault from
                            a stronger attacker.<\/p>\n
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            The class overran, there had been so much to say,
                            but as we all quickly cleared out of the studio to
                            get to the next Ladyfest event we left our email
                            addresses with Lydia. The nature of feminist
                            self-defence, as a DIY movement, is that one takes
                            what one has learned and passes it on. Lydia and
                            Sian\u2019s instructor had done so, and now the two
                            of them were passing it on as well. They told us
                            that they wanted to prepare another class in London,
                            and would contact us with details. I handed round
                            flyers for BadRep, having already mentioned
                            I&#8217;d be writing about the class, and it was
                            decided that our readers should contact Lydia and
                            Sian if they were interested in another London-based
                            class, or if interested in resources for starting
                            their own classes elsewhere in the country.
