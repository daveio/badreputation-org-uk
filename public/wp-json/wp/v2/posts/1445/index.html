          Besides they all have issues &amp; a mind of there own. And cost a
          fortune to keep going.<br \ />\n&#8211; Because they are always wet at
          the bottom!<br \ />\n&#8211; Because the are grace full and slander
          also very majestic.\u00a0Just like my woman.<br \ />\n&#8211; Because

                OK, you got me. My finely-honed research techniques generally
                begin with asking Google. Believe it or not, this timeless
                question: &#8216;why is a ship called &#8220;she&#8221;?&#8217;
                seems to have eluded people for quite a while \u2013 along with

                We know
                <em
                  >ship <\/em>is probably Old English (<em
                    >scip<\/em>) but its ultimate etymology is officially
                    &#8216;uncertain&#8217;. The <a

                    recourse since my alma mater saw fit to strip me of my free
                    OED online access) considers it to be proto-Germanic (<em

                        gendering answers, it&#8217;s easily explained as
                        &#8216;a tree cut out&#8217;: Literal, man. This gives
                        us its first meaning, as &#8216;a\u00a0large sea-going
                        vessel&#8217;, as opposed to a smaller
                        <em
                          >boat<\/em>. In modern times, this means specifically
                          &#8216;a vessel having a bowsprit and three masts,
                          each of which consists of a lower top and topgallant
                          mast&#8217;.<\/p>\n

                            These may not be specifically gendered, but by the
                            1550s people were widely referring to an unsailed

                                  course, this was a trend appropriated in the
                                  sky-crazy 1960s to apply to aircraft and other
                                  heavy vehicles, and it is still widely used
