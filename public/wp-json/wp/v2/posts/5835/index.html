                                  of Billie Holiday or the stature of Bessie
                                  Smith. When you see pictures of her,
                                  she\u2019s\u2026 well, she\u2019s a little old
                                  lady.\u00a0 She\u2019s usually grinning,
                                  wearing ill-fitting sweaters, and with the
                                  same owl-like glasses that the Queen wears.
                                  The admiration she has won is all down to how
                                  she played, and not how she looked.<\/p>\n

                                  playing the blues, she raised nine children
                                  and worked for 26 years in a local factory.

                                </p>

                                  <p>
                                    Listening to Baker\u2019s talent, the first
                                    question that comes to mind is why
                                    didn\u2019t she get onto the stage earlier.
                                    To understand this, you need to understand
                                    how life was in the Carolinas for people who
                                    were living a hardscrabble life of farming
                                    and mill work. Opportunities for music were
                                    local not national. Skilled musicians played
                                    with family, for local dances, at church, or
                                    may be in a nearby town&#8230;. \u201cMy
                                    husband could play piano real well,\u201d
                                    Baker reflects. \u201cI believe we could
                                    have made it, but as he did not want to
                                    leave home, there was nothing I could
                                    say.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n

                                    Performing on stage or to large audiences is
                                    of course no measure of talent, or even of
                                    influence. And in interviews Baker herself
                                    didn&#8217;t seem to have any regrets. But
                                    when I hear her and her sister play I
                                    can\u2019t help but wonder about all the
                                    other ordinary extraordinary women
                                    we\u2019ll never know about.<\/p>\n
