          I ain&#8217;t gonna lie, readers; it took me a while to write this
          one.\u00a0 I got home from seeing
          <strong
            >Pacific Rim<\/strong>, irritated and betrayed (for reasons
            I&#8217;ll explain), and got on The Internet, ready to share my
            frustrations with the film with a giant swathe of the population
            that I assumed would doubtless have the same irritations I
            did.<\/p>\n

              fact, I found a great number of people whose feminism and opinions
              I respected claiming it this great inclusive\/representational
              victory and lauding the characterisation of the, um, one
              woman.\u00a0 My crest fell.\u00a0 I suddenly felt ashamed and
              cowed.\u00a0 Maybe they&#8217;re right, I thought.\u00a0 Maybe
              Pacific Rim is this Big Thing after all and I&#8217;m just this
              picky little boy who should swallow my face and look
              grateful.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              Or maybe it&#8217;s like
              <strong
                >Avengers Assemble <\/strong>all over again, where everyone and
                their dog made

                  singing the praises of his Black Widow and how boss she was,
                  and all I could think was &#8220;yeah but she still strangles
                  men with her thighs in a black leather catsuit though
                  doesn&#8217;t she&#8221;.\u00a0 It&#8217;s a step forward, but
                  even further steps could have been so easy, yet weren&#8217;t
                  taken.<\/p>\n
                  <p>
                    Let&#8217;s look at Pacific Rim&#8217;s director,
                    <strong
                      >Guillermo del Toro<\/strong>.\u00a0 Now, Guillermo is my
                      homeboy.\u00a0 We go way back.\u00a0 He&#8217;s made some
                      of my favourite films in the world ever, and written some
                      of the best women in filmland, and then put them in main
                      roles (example:
                      <strong
                        >Pan&#8217;s Labyrinth<\/strong>).<\/p>\n
                        <p>
                          Mako (<strong
                            >Rinko Kikuchi<\/strong>) is good in Pacific Rim,
                            sure, but despite what others say about her getting
                            the protagonist&#8217;s development arc, she<em>
                              isn&#8217;t<\/em> the protagonist, Boring Raleigh
                              (<strong
                                >Charlie Hannam<\/strong>) is, and that&#8217;s
                                where the film focuses.\u00a0 It needn&#8217;t
                                have done, as Mako does indeed get a nice
                                narrative arc of her very own &#8211; but it
                                really does focus on Raleigh instead.\u00a0 Why,
                                Guillermo?\u00a0 Why?<\/p>\n
                                <p>
                                  Why focus on the boring guy?\u00a0 The boring
                                  inexplicable guy who is not only tedious, but
                                  a TERRIBLE choice for &#8220;massive robot
                                  pilot saviour of mankind&#8221; because he
                                  consistently makes awful decisions?\u00a0
                                  Decisions so awful, in fact, that I thought
                                  that maybe his progress through the film would
                                  punish him for his reckless endangering of
                                  human lives &#8211; but then he was eventually
                                  lauded for them!\u00a0 I just.
                                  <em>
                                    No. <\/em>(There was a lot wrong with
