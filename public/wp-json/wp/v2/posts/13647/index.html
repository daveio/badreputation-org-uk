              <p>Everyone approaches veganism from a different angle.<\/p>\n</p>
              <p>
                Some vegans find their way into it through kindness and empathy
                for living creatures; others are swayed by hard facts and
                shocking images. Neither is more or less agreeable, and I
                suspect that in our day-to-day lives, most vegans use a
                combination of both when faced with questions from curious
                veggie or omni friends.<\/p>\n

                PETA are a massive organisation, and they spread a very clear

                for entertainment \u2013 but we\u2019ll appropriate the

                PETA aren\u2019t the only platform for animal rights, though.
                Vegans rejoiced a few weeks ago when the beta version of <a
                href=\"http:\/\/ble.at\/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong
                  >Ble.at<\/strong><\/a> finally went live. For you carnivores
                  not in the loop, Ble.at is a social network for vegans to
                  exchange recipes, activist resources, articles, images and
                  videos. <\/p>\n
                  <p>
                    It\u2019s similar to Tumblr and Twitter insofar as the
                    primary purpose is to upload original content that can then
                    be reblogged (\u201crebleated\u201d) by fellow vegans.
                    It\u2019s a great way for vegans to connect on a micro
                    level, by spreading awareness of local causes and events,
                    and on a macro level by communicating with vegans on a
                    global scale.<\/p>\n
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For the first week, it was mostly gifs of piglets,
                    infographics of banana ice cream recipes, and cartoon
                    avocados. With 5,500 profiles created within seven days of
                    the site\u2019s launch, the content rapidly improved:
                    awesome recipes, powerful pro-vegan ads, witty one-liners
                    and inspirational quotes promoting veganism were rife. But
                    unfortunately, so was rape culture.<\/p>\n
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Due to the reblogging nature of the site, the same images
                    kept popping into my feed: an illustration of an angry cow
                    squeezing the bare breast of a lactating woman, a cartoon of
                    a robot raping a blood-covered cow<sup

                      experiences (below right). <\/p>\n
                      <p>
                        Most shocking of all was a video entitled <a

                        mother has her baby snatched from her arms by masked men
                        with bloodied hands, who then tear open her blouse to

                      <p>
                        When I mentioned my abhorrence of the casual connection
                        between rape and the dairy industry on Twitter, a vegan
                        pal asked, \u201cWhat else would you call
                        it?\u201d<\/p>\n
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Well, the industry term for the bench on which female
                        cows are artificially inseminated is often the
                        \u201crape rack\u201d, so referring to the process as
                        rape isn\u2019t a particular stretch. But the very fact
                        that this is a common term within the dairy industry is
                        a product of rape culture.<\/p>\n
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The pig factory employee found forcing metal rods and
                        electrodes into the vaginas of sows is a product of rape
                        culture. The flagrant disregard for the mental health of
                        survivors by flaunting these triggering images to
                        promote veganism is a product of rape culture.<\/p>\n
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        By comparing the industrialised rape and infanticide of
                        the dairy industry to the rape and infanticide of women
                        and children, we are asking non-vegans to project the
                        empathy for the latter onto the suffering of the former.
                        The problem with comparing the dairy industry to rape is
                        that we still live in a rape culture.<\/p>\n

                        By spreading these images of women being assaulted, we
                        are supporting rape culture, and we are appropriating
                        the suffering and strength of survivors. It is
                        unacceptable to hijack, trigger and traumatise to
                        forward a cause that has so many other convincing

                        shoves civil rights, women\u2019s liberation, LGBTQI
                        rights, issues of race and body positivism aside with
