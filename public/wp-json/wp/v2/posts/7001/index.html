    Chav, n. British slang (derogatory).\u00a0 In the United Kingdom (originally
    the south of England): a young person of a type characterized by brash and
    loutish behaviour and the wearing of designer-style clothes (esp.
    sportswear); usually with connotations of a low social status.<\/p>\n

          If \u2018cunt\u2019 is reportedly losing its power to shock or offend,
          don\u2019t worry, other c-words are available. \u2018Class\u2019, for
          instance, appears to have become unsuitable for use in polite society
          these days, while \u2018Chav\u2019 has become commonplace in the
          respectable parlance of those who would never dream of using any other
          c-word so blithely. Owen Jones\u2019s book <a

              political and cultural discourse in the context of a simultaneous

              traditional working-class identity.<\/p>\n

                study<\/a>\u00a0described \u2018chav\u2019 as a strange
                subculture which, unlike its predecessors, lacked any
                association with a particular musical movement or political
                ideals. 2004 saw the rise of <a
                href=\"http:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/news\/media\/marketing-its-time-to-tap-the-chav-pound-innit-533318.html\">\u2018chavertising\u2019<\/a>,
                a marketing strategy targeting \u2019chavs\u2019 as a subculture
                with spending power, whose members \u2018wore their wealth\u2019
                and prioritised consumption. At the tail-end of 2004, I attended
                a gig in Chatham by the former Libertine Carl Barat, whose
                dubious supergroup, in deference to the town\u2019s history with
                the term, and with who knows what degree of irony or
                self-awareness, styled themselves \u2018The Chavs\u2019 for the
                evening. And the (working class and Welsh) novelty rap crew <a

                which is concentrated in political and media discourse and which
                is overwhelmingly used about the working class rather than by
                them. This hasn\u2019t always been, and isn\u2019t always the
                case &#8211; Lynsey Hanley\u2019s <a
                href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/books\/2011\/jun\/08\/chavs-demonization-owen-jones-review\">review
                of the book<\/a> locates the idea of \u2018chavs\u2019 within
                the complexities of working-class communities, where the word
                can be used to differentiate between &#8216;those who aim for
                &#8220;respectability&#8221; and those who disdain it&#8217;.
                Back in my 1990s comprehensive-schooled childhood, the latter
                group were certainly distinguishable, known with varying degrees
                of contempt, amusement or nervousness as &#8216;neds&#8217; or
                &#8216;townies&#8217;. But these terms were localised, used
                within a community to delineate internal\u00a0hierarchies,
                rather than to section off an entire community by those at one
                socio-economic remove from it.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                Regardless of the tortuous relationship between the term and the
                demographic it describes, the use of the word in 21st century
                political discourse has developed a peculiar, specific and
                politically-loaded edge. Jones outlines how the word has been
                stripped of its previous meaning and reapplied in government and
                media rhetoric, almost invariably being conflated with
                &#8216;lower socio-economic group&#8217; by those of a higher
                one, without reference to or cognisance of the lower
                socio-economic individuals being tarred with the same
                brush.<\/p>\n

              <h3>
                An equal-opportunity stereotype?<\/h3>\n
                <p>
                  At first glance, \u2018chav\u2019 is a term tied to class
                  rather than gender. Chav stereotypes are remarkably
                  even-handed: for every lager-swilling lout there\u2019s a <a
                  href=\"http:\/\/chavmum.co.uk\/the_team.shtml\">single
                  mother<\/a>, for every Wayne Rooney a <a
                  href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=s0gmYkNJXVI\">Waynetta
                  Slob<\/a>. The sports gear and leisurewear prominent in
                  \u2018chav\u2019 uniform is a type of dress which makes it
                  possible to efface one&#8217;s femininity with shapeless
                  tracksuits and scraped-back hair.\u00a0The baseball cap which
                  graces the cover of Jones\u2019 book is a\u00a0gender-neutral
                  accessory.\u00a0Is the female \u2018chav\u2019 a recognisable
                  figure? A google image search for \u2018chavette\u2019 brings
                  up images of relative deprivation and degradation rather than
                  the upwardly-mobile targets of \u2018chavertising\u2019 \u2013
                  the ubiquitous Croydon facelift, tracksuits, pregnant stomachs
                  and yards of bare skin. Many of these are self-conscious or
                  pastiche portrayals by those not identifying as a permanent
                  part of the subculture \u2013 a kind of chav drag.
                  There\u2019s also a Newcastle fancy-dress company selling a <a

                        which chav-hatred can contain. Anti-chav commentators
                        reveal a disquieting obsession with the presumed sexual

                            Here an anti-chav stance allows a thoroughly
                            unpleasant perpetuation of damaging stereotypes of
                            the working class female (sexual promiscuity, sexual
                            precociousness, a thoughtless or scheming lack of
                            protection resulting in pregnancy) as well as a
                            proscribing of non-traditional behaviour (women
                            existing outside traditional family roles, deriving
                            financial support from the state rather than a
                            husband). All this with barely a glance at context
                            or circumstance. Imogen Tyler&#8217;s 2008 study <a
