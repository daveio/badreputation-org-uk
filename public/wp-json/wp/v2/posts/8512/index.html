  First of all, my sincerest apologies for disappearing into the far reaches of
  the internet but that terrible thing called Real Life decided to poke its nose
  where it wasn\u2019t wanted.\u00a0 I
  <strong
    >will<\/strong>\u00a0tell you all about the <a
    href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/2011\/10\/03\/gamer-diary-badrep-goes-to-eurogamer\/\">Eurogamer
    Expo<\/a>, and I still have those goodies to give away, so please forgive my
    extended absence!<\/p>\n
    <p>
      Today, I present to you my observations of the post-apocalyptic female
      form, with visual examples from <a title=\"RAGE website\"
      href=\"http:\/\/www.rage.com\" target=\"_blank\"><strong
        >RAGE<\/strong><\/a>, the recent<a title=\"id Software's site\"
        href=\"http:\/\/www.idsoftware.com\" target=\"_blank\">
        <strong
          >id Software<\/strong><\/a> release.\u00a0 In case I didn\u2019t
          mention it before, I am a bit of an id fan \u2013 seeing as how
          <strong
            >Doom<\/strong> was the first proper game I ever played \u2013 so
            criticising them was a bit of a forced exercise for me.\u00a0 But
            criticise I must!\u00a0 When I first saw the trailers and<a
            title=\"RAGE preview from Quakecon\"
            href=\"http:\/\/youtu.be\/T3J2dnhR1KE\" target=\"_blank\"> preview
            footage <\/a> for RAGE I noted the presence of <a
            href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/2011\/05\/16\/gamer-diary-rpg-advertising-women\/\">female
            characters<\/a>(!). However, they were distinctly boobed-up and
            inappropriately attired for life in a wasteland environment,
            especially given all the
            <em
              >violence<\/em>\u00a0also included in these vids.<\/p>\n
              <p>
                I&#8217;d noticed this before in other post-apocalypse\/global
                bad thing games, like
                <strong
                  >Fallout: New Vegas<\/strong> and
                  <em
                    >definitely<\/em>\u00a0in
                    <strong
                      >Borderlands<\/strong>.\u00a0 It is also apparent in
                      fantasy RPGs like
                      <strong
                        >Dragon Age<\/strong>, as well as sci-fi\/horror titles
                        like
                        <strong
                          >Dead Space<\/strong>.\u00a0 All these women are
                          stereotypically \u2018beautiful\u2019, i.e. there is
                          not a blemish in sight, their waists are tiny, their
                          boobs are pert (and, more often than not, on display),
                          their eyes are big and shiny, etc \u2013 you get the
                          idea!<\/p>\n
                          <p>
                            However, my quibble here is not just the fact that
                            it is disgustingly demeaning, shallow and pathetic
                            but also that it is totally unreal and
                            impractical.\u00a0 What were the developers
                            thinking?!\u00a0 I\u2019m sure women may
                            <em
                              >seem<\/em> all alien and scary to design, but
                              when it comes to internal vital organs, like the
                              heart and lungs, they\u2019re in the same place as
                              a man\u2019s.\u00a0 IN THE CHEST.\u00a0 So, why
                              would any vaguely intelligent female survivor of
                              the apocalypse waltz around with the most
                              vulnerable part of her body un-armoured and on
                              display?\u00a0 How are they not all dead?\u00a0 In
                              this world full of bandits, territorial gangs,
                              mutants and some evil authoritarian organisation
                              out to kill them, how is it all the
                              bullets\/knives\/arrows\/rockets\/etc have missed
                              the gaping void in their armour
                              <em
                                >exactly where their hearts are<\/em>?<\/p>\n
                                <p>
                                  So there\u2019s that part of the issue.\u00a0
                                  Secondarily, if we look at these women in
                                  these games, they look as if they could be
                                  glamour models in this day and age.\u00a0 Now,
                                  not to cast doubt on the practicality of
                                  models in general, but how many of them, do
                                  you think, would even survive the initial
                                  global devastating event, let alone eke out an
                                  existence fighting and killing fellow
                                  humans?\u00a0 Personally, I intend to build a
                                  labyrinthine nuclear bunker under my house
                                  when I can, but I accept that I\u2019m
                                  abnormal and most glamour models won\u2019t be
                                  thinking of these things.\u00a0 My point
                                  being, I am not
                                  <em
                                    >that kind of pretty<\/em>\u00a0and of all
                                    the people I know that might survive a
                                    wasteland environment none of them are
                                    model-esque in their features.<\/p>\n
                                    <p>
                                      Nor are any of them stupid enough to wear
                                      armour that exposes their chest.<\/p>\n
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                      So this leads me to wonder whether all of
                                      these devastating global events were
                                      actually designed so that &#8211; in the

                                      danger) behind.\u00a0 If so, how then can
                                      we assume these women survived?\u00a0
                                      Proffering sexual favours with the alpha

                                      ogre-ish thing to consider, but what other
                                      explanation is there for

                                          I doubt that the developers ever think
                                          this sort of thing through, as
                                          they\u2019re too busy patronising
                                          their male audiences with images of

                                          than just sexist and misogynist.\u00a0
                                          For games that desire heightened
                                          realism, they haven\u2019t thought it
