      become clearer through practice, as it works from A-Z.<\/p>\n<p

      reasonable neutrality), the make-up of the English mother-tongue, to
      consider how the language has evolved over the centuries, and in the
      process to prompt some questions about how gender issues are woven into
      the fabric of the language we use everyday.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:

        <p>
          For those readers who never owned the Greek alphabet on a
          tea-towel,\u00a0the &#8216;maz&#8217; sound mid-<em
            >Amazon<\/em> is the same &#8216;maz&#8217; you find in
            &#8216;mastectomy&#8217; and its (mostly medical) cognates. This is
            because the Amazons in question \u2013 a race of female warriors
            alleged to have lived in ancient Scythia, and the first definition
            for the first word of the Alphabet of Femininism (hoorah!) \u2013
            were said to have been rather expert in just this procedure. Or, as
            the dictionary puts it, rather dryly \u2013 and, indeed,
            euphemistically \u2013 &#8216;they destroyed their right breast to
            avoid interfering with the use of the bow&#8217;.<\/p>\n
            <p>
              In so self-mastectomising, this army of women obviously lay
              themselves open to the extended (and more explicitly
              gender-specific) meaning that
              <em
                >amazon<\/em> took on around the mid-eighteenth century. Here,
                an
                <em
                  >amazon <\/em>is &#8216;a very strong, tall, or masculine
                  woman&#8217;, unsurprising since they are, etymologically,
                  removers of those most vexed of female glands in favour of
                  ease in brandishing weaponry (more generally considered A
                  Man&#8217;s Job).<\/p>\n
                  <p>
                    This all said, the original Amazons do not appear to have
                    been either an (exclusively) lesbian tribe, or even an
                    anti-maternal one: Strabo, the Greek geographer, would have
                    it that they periodically had a baby-breeding field trip to
                    a neighbouring male tribe (the Gargareans). The resultant
                    boy-children were exposed or sent back to their fathers; the
                    girls kept and trained up In The Amazon Way, a rare gender
                    upending for the olden days.<\/p>\n
                  </p>
                  <h3>
                    Alas! My Girdle!<\/h3>\n
                    <p>
                      But perhaps the most famous of these dedicated Amazons is
                      Hippolyte-slash-Hippolyta, the owner of a \u00a0magical
                      &#8216;girdle&#8217;, which Hercules stole in one of his
                      less catchy labours (bit pathetic altogether, isn&#8217;t
                      it? It&#8217;s got a bit of a spotty thirteen year old boy
                      feel to it, in fact. &#8216;Hey Hercules! See that woman?
                      I dare you to steal her girdle! Yeeah, dude, you
                      rock!&#8217; \u2013 That said, I&#8217;ve never been
                      completely sure what a &#8216;girdle&#8217; means in
                      Ancient Scythia: I can&#8217;t really imagine an army of
                      one-breasted women in the habit of frequent &#8216;bow
                      handling&#8217; being particularly concerned about how
                      cinched their waists are. My childhood book of
                      <em
                        >Greek Myths And Legends<\/em> depicts it as a sort of
                        extra snazzy belt, so that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going
                        with).<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_57\" style=\"width:
