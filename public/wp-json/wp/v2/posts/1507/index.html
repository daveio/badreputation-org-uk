<p>
  I attended the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.transgenderdor.org\/\"><strong
    >International Transgender Day of Remembrance<\/strong><\/a> event in
    Brighton with my best friend on the 21st of November.\u00a0 I went with the
    full intent to write about it, and then spent the entire afternoon
    afterwards in my shellshocked, harrowed-out daze, wondering what the hell to
    say.<\/p>\n
    <p>
      There are a couple of things I&#8217;d like to get out of the way
      first.\u00a0 Firstly, some readers may be aware, others aren&#8217;t
      &#8211; I&#8217;m transgendered.\u00a0 I&#8217;m a guy with
      non-factory-standard genitals.\u00a0 So there&#8217;s that.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, I have some privileges of my own that I want to lay down.\u00a0
      I&#8217;m white, I&#8217;m able-bodied, I don&#8217;t have any
      disabilities or illnesses that anyone can see, I&#8217;m middle-class and
      I have a house.\u00a0 I do my best to work around these in how I treat
      people and the world around me, but I know that sometimes, they&#8217;re
      going to cause me to fuck up a bit.\u00a0 So there&#8217;s that,
      too.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh &#8211; one other thing I have: I have passing privilege,
      sometimes.\u00a0 Not all the time, but sometimes.\u00a0 Which is great,
      but also a thing to consider, because then I get to have male privilege,
      too.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      We got to the venue for the remembrance service, and I was nervous.\u00a0
      I&#8217;ve never really been to any specifically trans-inclusive spaces
      &#8211; let alone a church! &#8211; and didn&#8217;t know what to
      expect.\u00a0 I was surprised!\u00a0 It was very welcoming, very inclusive
      and friendly, and the service was well thought-out.\u00a0 I felt as though
      I was on friendly territory.\u00a0 Which was nice.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Now: the service.\u00a0 What happened was, after a vigil for the loss of a
      member of the Brighton trans*<sup
        ><a href=\"#footnote_0_1507\" id=\"identifier_0_1507\"
        class=\"footnote-link footnote-identifier-link\" title=\" I&rsquo;m
        using the term &ldquo;trans*&rdquo; to specifically include anyone with
        a trans &ndash; transgender, transsexual, whoever. I&rsquo;m using it as
        a catch-all inclusive term for those with a non-binary gender identity,
        regardless of status in transition or not, what or where.
        \">1<\/a><\/sup> community, the list of victims between 2009 and 2010
        was read out.\u00a0 Name, age, date of death &#8211; and manner in which
        they were killed.<\/p>\n
        <p>
          If this sounds horrifying and harrowing, let me tell you: it is
          absolutely nothing compared to the experience.\u00a0 It was so
          horrible.\u00a0 It was so hard to read, so numbingly dreadful and so
          damn depressing that I just burst into tears after reading my first
          victim&#8217;s name.\u00a0 She was stabbed up and abandoned in a
          dump.\u00a0 I thought, is this really the world I&#8217;m
          transitioning in today?\u00a0 Is this the reception I&#8217;m to
          expect from the public?\u00a0 Is this a true reflection of how
          transgender people are perceived?<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          There were photographs of some of the victims, too.\u00a0 Now, here
          I&#8217;m brought back to passing privilege.\u00a0 There is an
          insidious, embarrassing, totally inaccurate and highly offensive
          supposition in the media (that appears to have been slowly,
          <em
            >very slowly<\/em>, dying out since the 1970s) that all trans*
            people are trans women who don&#8217;t pass.\u00a0 These victims
            were not they.\u00a0 The victims whose pictures I saw were women
            with passing privilege.\u00a0 These were not the cruel media&#8217;s
            &#8220;favourite&#8221; sort of transgendered victim; the pantomime
            parody that\u2019s miles and miles away from real trans* people and
            does more to inspire mockery in the public rather than righteous
            anger on their behalf.<\/p>\n
            <p>
              This realisation served to remind me how bloody vulnerable trans*
              people are in the face of a society that can&#8217;t or
              won&#8217;t understand them.\u00a0 These people were the members
              of our community who had that enviable passing privilege
              that&#8217;s meant to help one lead a &#8220;normal&#8221; life
              (for whatever definition of &#8220;normal&#8221; you
              prefer).\u00a0 I know that when I don&#8217;t have passing
              privilege, I feel intensely isolated; like some inexplicable,
              unintelligible Other that will never be able to, say, use a public
              bathroom without coming under suspicion and scrutiny.\u00a0 The
              transgender experience is, whatever your level of passing
              privilege, a very isolating one.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              There are support groups, but they&#8217;re few and far between,
              lost in a tide of support groups for lesbian, gay and bisexual
              people who also have their own unfair share of discrimination and
              isolation.\u00a0 I know I have trouble finding anything outside of
              London, which is where I&#8217;m not.\u00a0 I know it&#8217;s
              often quite hard to find other trans guys within accessible
              transgender communities (we&#8217;re outnumbered by the ladies 10
              to 1 in Britain!\u00a0 Isn&#8217;t that interesting?) if we can
              work up courage enough to go at all.\u00a0 Many of us can&#8217;t
              find support in our family &#8211; quite the opposite, sometimes
              &#8211; and coming out to social groups often ensures the
              sloughing of manifestly unhelpful acquaintances.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              It&#8217;s lonely.\u00a0 We need allies.\u00a0 We need allies that
              are close to us, and we need allies that are further away in the
              media and government.\u00a0 I mused upon this as I moistened my
              best friend&#8217;s shoulder at the service, and then mused upon
              it further as we nerded out over different sorts of tea
              later.\u00a0 I did some extra musing when I emerged, resplendent,
              from the bathroom and announced excitedly to her that I&#8217;d
              been read as male there, and she was gleeful and pleased for
              me.\u00a0 We need people like this in our lives.\u00a0 My friend
              is cisgendered and she understands.\u00a0 She makes the effort to
              understand and to support and include.\u00a0 She does this, and in
              doing so, she&#8217;s one member of the majority that will
              encourage others to do the same.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              So, hurrah for allies.\u00a0 Thank god for allies within the
              LGBTQI community that go against the distressing trend of leaving
              off the &#8220;T&#8221; from the acronym, or argue with those that
              would claim trans women who like women to not be &#8220;real
              lesbians&#8221;.\u00a0 Thank god for allies within the feminist
              community who don&#8217;t agree with Germaine Greer or Julie
              Bindel&#8217;s frankly disgusting attitudes towards transgendered
              people.\u00a0 But perhaps most of all, I&#8217;m thankful for
              cisgendered allies who love and care for their trans* friends and
              make the effort to spread tolerance, support and understanding
              within the majority.<\/p>\n

              I started writing this post hideously disaffected, thinking about
              my challenging relationship with my family and how far-reaching
              crimes against trans* people are.\u00a0 But now I&#8217;ve
              remembered that there are people, like you, dear BadRep reader,
              who

                <em
                  >do<\/em> get it.\u00a0 So thank you, too.\u00a0 Here&#8217;s
                  a comic of me and my friend having a tea-off.\u00a0
                  You&#8217;re welcome.<\/div>\n
