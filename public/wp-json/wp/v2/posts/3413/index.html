    >Nellie Bly<\/strong> (born Elizabeth Jane Cochran) was not the sort of
    person who took nonsense from anybody. A pioneering journalist, she got her
    first break in writing when she grew angry at the appalling views on women
    touted by Erasmus Wilson, the most popular columnist of the
    <em
      >Pittsburgh Dispatch<\/em>, and wrote them a letter to complain. The
      paper, impressed by the spirit of the letter, took her on as a
      columnist.\u00a0 This is a fantastic way to get a job, declaring \u201cNo,
      you\u2019re awful. I could do this much better. Let me show you how,\u201d
      and then backing up that claim.<\/p>\n

        life before this hadn\u2019t exactly been simple, something which may
        have helped her develop her intense levels of badass. Born the 13th
        child out of 15, Bly\u2019s father died when she was six, leaving her
        mother and siblings with nothing due to will issues. Her stepfather was
        an abusive drunk, whom Bly described in court as being \u201cgenerally
        drunk since he married my mother. When drunk he is very cross, and [he
        is] cross when sober.&#8221;<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        Bly\u2019s initial work for the
        <em
          >Dispatch <\/em>showed glimpses of the journalistic style she would go
          on to develop. She covered the difficulties faced by working class
          women and girls, the urgent need for reforming the state\u2019s
          divorce laws, and the lives of local factory workers. So the editors
          decided after this to put her in the &#8216;women\u2019s
          interest&#8217; pages and have her cover minor fashion events and
          flower shows. Bly tried to get back to serious reporting by having
          herself sent to Mexico to write as the
          <em
            >Dispatch<\/em>\u2019s foreign correspondent, but this only lasted
            for a few months before she was returned once again to the
            women\u2019s pages.<\/p>\n
            <p>
              Did Bly settle for a career writing lighthearted fluff, or give up
              journalism, accepting Wilson\u2019s claim that a woman doing more
              serious work would be \u201ca monstrosity\u201d? Of course she
              didn\u2019t, because she was awesome. She left a suitably
              withering note for Wilson and moved to New York in order to find
              work on a paper that would take her seriously.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, getting into journalism is not an easy task. It isn\u2019t
              easy now and it wasn\u2019t easy in 1887, particularly if you
              happened to be poor and female. Generally after six months of
              failing to get a job, one might give up and return home to do
              something easier. The people covered in this series are not the
              sort of people who give up and go home when things get hard,
              however, and after six months of knocking on doors Bly managed an
              interview at the
              <em
                >New York World<\/em>, owned by
                <strong
                  >Joseph Pulitzer <\/strong>(he of the prize). The editor, John
                  Cockerill, &#8211; possibly in an attempt to deter her &#8211;
                  challenged Bly to write a piece on <a
                  href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Blackwell%27s_Island\"><strong
                    >Blackwell\u2019s Island<\/strong><\/a>, then home to a
                    notorious New York asylum.<\/p>\n
                    <p>
                      In order to fully appreciate how blazingly fantastic what
                      Bly did next was, it\u2019s important to realise that
                      investigative journalism wasn\u2019t really a thing that
                      existed at that point. People didn\u2019t go undercover to
                      write reports, or press closely-guarded inside sources for
                      facts. It just wasn\u2019t something that happened. This
                      is what made Nellie Bly a pioneering journalist: she went
                      undercover, and feigning insanity for 10 days, managed to
                      have herself sent as a patient to the Women&#8217;s
                      Lunatic Asylum on Blackwell\u2019s Island to see for
                      herself what was going on. This was particularly bold, as
                      she had no guarantee she would be able to secure her
                      release when the piece was done, and indeed had some
                      difficulty regaining her freedom. She came back with a
                      story of cruelty, beatings and poor conditions &#8211;
                      examples of pretty much everything that was wrong with
                      19th century mental health care. Not only did Bly\u2019s
                      report get her the job at the
                      <em
                        >New York World<\/em>, it also drew public and political
                        attention to the institution. This brought money and
                        much needed changes, improving the lives of the people
                        treated there. An impressive achievement for someone
                        only just starting their career.<\/p>\n

                            Pioneering the field of investigative journalism and
                            spending her career writing important pieces on
                            workers&#8217; rights, the treatment of women, and
                            other socially important issues wasn\u2019t quite
                            enough for Bly, however. She still had a significant
                            quantity of badass in her that she needed to make
                            use of, and there was only one outlet for it that
                            held sufficient coolness: a race around the world.
