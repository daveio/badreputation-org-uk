  Oh! Darling.<\/h3>\n
  <p>
    <em
      >Ovary<\/em> hopped onto the semantic stage around 1658 meaning &#8216;the
      female organ of reproduction in animals, in which
      <em
        >ova <\/em>or eggs are produced&#8217; (<em
          >ova <\/em>being the Latin plural form of
          <em
            >ovum <\/em>= egg). Eggs, of course, are now generally recognised as
            a crucial part of reproduction in all species (a chicken ovulates
            every day, fact fans), making the
            <em
              >ovary <\/em>rather important for the construction of
              little&#8217;uns. Straightforwardly, the word derives from
              <em
                >ovarium: <\/em>&#8216;ovum&#8217; + &#8216;-arium&#8217;
                (aquarium, oceanarium,\u00a0planetarium, toastarium).
                Consistency: it&#8217;s helpful. But hold! 1658? Really? What
                about before? Was there some mass genital evolution in the late
                seventeenth century that made early modern cisgendered Woman so
                drastically different from her medieval sisters?<\/p>\n<div

                  Well no, but there was an evolution in what Scientists
                  considered &#8220;Woman&#8221; to be. For hundreds of
                  thousands of years previous, the established thinking had been
                  that they were simply men &#8216;turned outside-in&#8217;:
                  female genitals were held &#8216;up there&#8217; by a colder
                  body temperature than their male counterparts,\u00a0and,
                  thus,\u00a0sex differences were a matter of degree. Women were
                  men who hadn&#8217;t quite unfurled properly.<\/p>\n

                                      Seventeenth-century scientists approached

                                      Aristotle reckoned male semen gave the
