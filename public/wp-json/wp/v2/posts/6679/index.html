      \/><\/a>Reams have been written about whether
      <strong
        >Tank Girl<\/strong> is a legitimate feminist icon or not. My position
        is something along the lines of OMIGODILOVEHER which comes partly from a
        feminist place and partly from a place of profound 12 year old
        outsiderdom and rage.<\/p>\n

            which belongs to early Tank Girl.<\/p>\n
            <p>
              Where to start? She
              <em

                she has a slightly implausible figure, but she&#8217;s a million
                miles away from traditional balloon breasted comic book
                heroines. She is rather androgynous, masculine without being
                butch, has actual facial expressions and a great <a title=\"Tank

                target=\"_blank\">philosophy<\/a> about clothes. She is sexy,
                and sexual, but in a way which entirely rejects the idea of a
                performed sex appeal.<\/p>\n
                <p>
                  Then there&#8217;s her attitude. Irreverent and subversive to
                  the very core of her being, she is linked in some of the
                  stories with a demonic force, a sort of soul of chaos.
                  There&#8217;s a great story where an aboriginal community
                  summons a kind of mystical proto-Tank Girl (called Tanicha) to
                  wreak bloody vengeance on the white men who are trying to
                  steal their land and assault the women.<sup

                      But then there are a few moments in which she is
                      breathtakingly, shockingly human, even vulnerable. In one
                      story, she dreams that her friends and her lover have had
                      their minds destroyed in a psychiatric institution,
                      <strong
                        >One Flew Over The Cuckoo&#8217;s Nest
                        <\/strong>-stylee. She wakes up shaken and goes to sit
                        outside her beloved tank to think. As the sun comes up,
                        her lover brings her a mug of tea. He&#8217;s a mutant
                        kangaroo called Booga, for anyone who doesn&#8217;t
                        know, but that doesn&#8217;t make the moment any less
                        touching.<\/p>\n
                        <p>
                          Although many of the characters that accompany her on
                          her adventures are men, her female relationships are
                          surprisingly significant. Her two childhood friends
                          Jet Girl and Sub Girl are introduced in a story about
                          her birthday party (spoiled through a lack of decent
                          beer) and one issue consists of a letter from Tank
                          Girl to her mum. She also goes to England at one point
                          to visit her sick grandmother.<\/p>\n
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          And some of the best stories are where she gets one
                          over on a series of macho tough guys, from a kangaroo
                          gang leader to a bounty hunter who underestimates her
