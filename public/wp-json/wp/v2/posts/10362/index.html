  As a special treat for <a
  href=\"http:\/\/womenshistorymonth.wordpress.com\/\">Women\u2019s History
  Month<\/a>, the London Metropolitan University Board of Governors has decided
  to \u201c<a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.londonmetunison.org.uk\/2012\/03\/special-collections\/\">seek
  new homes<\/a>\u201d for their world-class trade union and women\u2019s
  history collections.<\/p>\n
</p>
<h3>
  Kicking ass since 1926<\/h3>\n
  <p>
    The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.londonmet.ac.uk\/thewomenslibrary\">Women\u2019s
    Library<\/a> collection was created in 1926 and has been housed in its
    purpose-built home in Aldgate for a decade. It\u2019s in constant use as a
    research facility and in recent years it has also branched out to become a
    vibrant force in the local community and beyond.<\/p>\n
  </p>
  <p>
    Their exhibitions, events and collaborations with artists are accessible,
    relevant and often hard-hitting. Their 2007 <a
    href=\"http:\/\/www.londonmet.ac.uk\/thewomenslibrary\/whats-on\/prostitution.cfm\">exhibition
    about prostitution<\/a> was one of the most thought-provoking, balanced and
    insightful I\u2019ve ever been to (and I spend a *lot* of time in museums)
    and was firmly rooted in partnership with local charities working with women
    on East End streets.<\/p>\n
  </p>
  <p>
    Another example is their immensely popular \u2018Alternative Jack the Ripper
    Walk\u2019 and <a
    href=\"http:\/\/www.londonmet.ac.uk\/thewomenslibrary\/whats-on\/exhibitions\/in-memoriam.cfm\">(In)
    Memoriam<\/a> installation, which included putting up memorial plaques to
    each of the Ripper\u2019s victims. The work presented an articulate
    challenge to the misogynist undertones of much of the murder tourism which
    brings visitors to their neighbourhood in Whitechapel while raising
    awareness of the violence against women that never seems to go out of
    fashion.<\/p>\n

      As you can probably sense, when I heard that London Met Uni is giving this
      vital centre the boot I was pretty angry. But I wasn\u2019t shocked. With
      educational institutions\u2019 budgets dribbling away and competition for
      research funding becoming ever more cut-throat, naturally specialist
      social history collections are in the firing line.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Social history is already viewed by some as fluffy girly history to the
      hard, throbbing Real Man\u2019s history of wars, leaders and money. And
      the social history of marginalised groups? The fluffiest, wimpiest, most
      irrelevant history of all! Fetch me a beer and a tiger to wrestle.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      I\u2019ve written <a
      href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/2011\/11\/10\/a-short-post-on-transgender-remembering\/\">before<\/a>
      about why discovering and recognising the history of marginalised groups
      is vital. It\u2019s not just about fairness, it\u2019s about resistance.
      It\u2019s having the weapons to fight back when you\u2019re told \u2018oh
      that\u2019s just the way things are\u2019, or \u2018but it\u2019s
      tradition\u2019. It\u2019s about stopping people telling whatever story
      they want about your life.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      It\u2019s also a way of keeping yourself going, whether by looking back
      and seeing how far we\u2019ve come, or by drawing inspiration from the
      people who came before you. That\u2019s why it matters whether or not we
      build all those <a href=\"http:\/\/www.maryonthegreen.org\/\">missing
      statues<\/a>. Or it should matter to anyone who\u2019s ever been on the
      sharp end of <a
      href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cultural_hegemony\">cultural
      hegemony<\/a>.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <h3>
      Look back, look forward<\/h3>\n
      <p>
        According to <a
        href=\"http:\/\/forbookssake.net\/2012\/03\/19\/the-womens-library-under-threat\/\">For
        Books\u2019 Sake<\/a> there will be a campaign against the decision to
        move the Women\u2019s Library and the TUC Library. For more information
        your best bet is probably to follow the Women\u2019s Library on <a
        href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/womenslibrary\">Twitter<\/a> or <a
        href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/thewomenslibrary\">Facebook<\/a> and
        watch out for updates.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        There are other archives of women\u2019s history which are available to
        the public in buildings and online, I\u2019ve listed some below (please
        add more in the comments!) But that doesn\u2019t mean we can be
        complacent. Please visit them, use them, value them.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        And while fully recognising the subtle, changeable and intricate nature
        of identity I&#8217;d say whoever you are, learn your history, whatever
        that means to you. And as an act of solidarity educate yourself about
        the people who&#8217;ve been written out of the textbooks.<\/p>\n
