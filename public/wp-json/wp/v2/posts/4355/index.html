  Star of stage and screen, major civil rights player, member of the French
  resistance, and recipient of the Croix de Guerre? That&#8217;s quite an
  impressive CV by any standards, and it only just begins to cover the
  achievements of
  <strong
    >Josephine Baker<\/strong>, one of the great performers and humanitarians of
    the 20th century.<\/p>\n
    <p>
      Born Freda Josephine Mcdonald in St Louis, Missouri in 1906, Baker\u2019s
      life got off to a rough start. As a child she worked as a cleaner and
      babysitter for a reportedly abusive wealthy woman \u2013 Baker later spoke
      of having her hands burnt for making a mistake, and of being told
      \u201cnot to kiss the baby\u201d, presumably to avoid somehow
      &#8220;racially tainting&#8221; the child. By the age of 12 she had run
      away to live on the streets, surviving the <a
      href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/East_St._Louis_Riot\">East St
      Louis Riots<\/a> of 1917, and working as a waitress and a street dancer.
      By the age of 15 she was onto her second marriage, where she picked up the
      Baker name she would keep through the rest of her career.<\/p>\n

      Around about 1921 things started to improve for Baker, as she moved to New
      York and began dancing in Broadway and vaudeville shows. Initially she was
      turned down as a vaudeville chorus dancer, described as \u201ctoo skinny
      and too dark.\u201d Not one to be put off, Baker worked as a dresser
      instead, learning all the dance moves from backstage. When a space came up
      for a chorus dancer she made herself the natural choice, knowing all the
      routines already, and put on an impressive performance. Before long she
      was one of the most successful chorus girls in vaudeville theatre.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Though successful, Baker found that continuing racial discrimination in
      the US led her to feel alienated and disrespected, and she moved to Paris
      in 1925. Here she quickly came to the attention of the director of the <a
      title=\"Wikipedia: Folies Berg\u00e8re\"
      href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Folies_Berg%C3%A8re\"
      target=\"_blank\">Folies Berg\u00e8re<\/a>, quickly climbing to stardom.
      She became one of the most talked about and photographed women in the
      world, and by 1927 was amongst the most highly paid entertainers alive
      (much of her pay being spent on pets. There\u2019s something fantastic
      about having a pet snake, goat, pig, parakeet, several cats, dogs, fish, a
      chimpanzee and a leopard.) In 1927 she also appeared in\u00a0 the silent
      film Siren of the Tropics, becoming the first African American woman to
      star in a major motion picture.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &#8220;She kissed babies in foundling homes, gave dolls to the young and
        soup to the aged, presided at the opening of the Tour de France,
        celebrated holidays, went to fairs, joked with workers and did charity
        benefits galore. She was all over Paris, always good-natured and
        exquisitely dressed.&#8221;<br \ />\n\u2028- Phyllis Rose,

          <p>
            Her return to America in 1936 did not go well. Audiences refused to
            accept the notion of a sophisticated black woman, and newspaper
            reviews tore her act apart, with the New York Times going so far as
            to refer to her as \u201ca Negro wench\u201d. She soon returned to
            France.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            When war broke out, Baker did not sit idly by. In addition to
            playing up her role as an entertainer and boosting troops&#8217;
            morale in Africa and Europe, she worked covertly for the French
            Resistance, smuggling secret messages on her sheet music and pinned
            to the inside of her clothing. This, and her wartime work with the
            Red Cross saw her awarded the <a title=\"Wikipedia: Croix de
            guerre\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Croix_de_guerre\"
            target=\"_blank\">Croix de guerre<\/a>, making her the first
            American-born woman to achieve this.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            Following the war Baker turned her attention to civil rights
            activism and unleashed a whole truckload of awesomeness. After her
            negative experiences performing in the US in the Thirties, Baker
            refused to perform at segregated clubs, and this insistence is
            credited with being influential in the integration of shows in Las
            Vegas. But that was only one tiny facet of her amazing actions in
            the Fifties and Sixties. <\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_4356\"

            You see, Baker wanted to demonstrate that there was absolutely no
            reason why people of different races and faiths couldn\u2019t live
            together just fine. So how did she set about proving this? By
            adopting a dozen children (whom she called her \u201cRainbow
            Tribe\u201d), from places as far-flung as Cote D\u2019Ivoire,
            Finland, Korea and Colombia, and raising them all together. Oh, and
            she raised them in a castle, the Chateau de Milandes, in Dordogne.
            Because if you\u2019re going to go to the effort of doing something
            you might as well go all the way and do it in a castle.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1963 Baker stood alongside
            <strong
              >Martin Luther King Jr<\/strong>. at the March on Washington when
              he made his \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech. Baker was the only
              woman to deliver a speech at the rally, and was later offered a
              place at the head of the American Civil Rights Movement following
              King\u2019s assassination, though she declined.<\/p>\n
              <p>
                Over the space of her career Baker managed to be a hugely
                influential performer, to risk her life as a part of the French
                Resistance, and to take a major role in the civil rights
                movement. There\u2019s just far too much kickassery in there to
                possibly sum up in the space of one post, so for more detailed
