          Very quietly, in April, a study was published that found that in
          American children&#8217;s books published between 1900 and 2000,
          female characters were under-represented by a ratio of 1.6:1. Not much
          happened. Then, at the beginning of this month, the <a

                    declaring (presumably based on the many years of research
                    that each of them had done) that the results were clearly
                    rubbish and anyway a bit of sexism never did me any harm now
                    get in the kitchen and put my tea on. The
                    <strong
                      >Guardian<\/strong>&#8216;s commenters largely ignored the
                      piece, or said &#8216;no shit, Sherlock&#8217; and went
                      back to what they were doing before. So far, so par for
                      the course. <\/p>\n
                      <p>
                        But this lack of inquisitive attention is wrong for two
                        reasons: first, this is a massive undertaking, so,
                        y&#8217;know, kudos; secondly, these findings are
                        Important. Important enough to use a capital
                        &#8216;I&#8217;: at a time when children are developing
                        their own gender identities, their literature both
                        represents and defines what is expected of them. We need
                        to know what those expectations are; the expectations
                        that come not from our own choice of books for our
                        children, but from what the literary establishment deems
                        &#8216;good&#8217; award winners are &#8211; rightly or
                        wrongly &#8211; arbiters of taste, gatekeepers of
                        acceptability. So when a study comes along that pays
                        particular attention to, amongst other things, a
                        century-worth of <a

                        notice. <\/p>\n

                      <p>
                        Children&#8217;s books, and books in general, are not
                        here-today-gone-tomorrow entities; they persist. In
                        short, voices from both the distant and recent past are
                        telling our children that women are simply not as
                        important as men.<\/p>\n
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I&#8217;m not going to blather on about why it&#8217;s
                        important for the message of gender of equality to be
                        strong in the cradle and the classroom, nor why the
                        repression of female characters in children&#8217;s
                        fiction reinforces patriarchal gender systems, because
                        if you&#8217;re over at BadRep you probably already know
                        (and if you don&#8217;t, plenty has been written on the
                        subject before).<\/p>\n

                        I<em>
                          am<\/em> going to blather on about why on earth this
                          disparity between the genders hasn&#8217;t changed
                          very much in a century.<\/p>\n

                            So, let us return to the statistics. Since the early
                            1970s, studies have repeatedly found girls and women
                            to be under-represented in children&#8217;s fiction,
                            and this latest one is no different. It finds that
                            in central roles male characters have a
                            representation of 57 percent, and female characters
                            only 31 percent. Significantly, it notes that
                            &#8220;no more than 33 percent of books published in
                            a year contain central characters who are adult
                            women or female animals, whereas adult men and male
                            animals appear in up to 100 percent&#8221;. You can

                                      fascinating in all sorts of ways, it is a
                                      large enough arena of study to warrant a
                                      separate post.<\/p>\n

                                      Children&#8217;s literature is
                                      particularly sensitive to sociopolitical
                                      forces. It&#8217;s probably not
                                      surprising, then, that this study finds
                                      spikes in the parity of gender
                                      representations coinciding with the second
                                      &#8211; and third &#8211; waves of
                                      feminism, so the books published in the
                                      1930s-1960s show less gender parity than
                                      those published before and after, and more
                                      equal representation of the genders in
                                      books published after 1970.<\/p>\n

                                          These peaks and troughs in the
                                          equality of gender representation
                                          paint a worrying picture. When the
                                          feminist movement is active, female
                                          and male characters do move towards a
                                          parity of representation. But when
                                          feminism goes off the boil, so does
                                          gender equality.<\/p>\n

                                          What does this mean for the futures of
                                          feminism? Are we destined to keep
                                          pushing the message, safe in the
                                          knowledge that it will be quickly
                                          unlearned if we stop? We cannot rest
                                          on our laurels. The third wave
                                          feminist movement has, arguably, made
                                          feminism more accessible, and this can
                                          only be a good thing. But history
                                          teaches us that we need to take the
                                          waves out of feminism, to keep
                                          working, to question inequality
                                          whenever we see it mindful that old
                                          habits die hard.<\/p>\n
