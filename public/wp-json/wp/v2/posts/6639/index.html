  I make no apologies. I love

    >She-Ra<\/strong>. Even just saying it makes me feel all empowered (come on,
    give me some &#8220;She Raaaargh!&#8221;). It&#8217;s like <a

        were lonely, sore thumbs sticking out of a world populated only by men.

                                          Guevara, only in gold lame. Sorry for
                                          that image. But I&#8217;ve got it and
                                          now you have too).<\/li>\n

                                              harking back to my original point,
                                              but that&#8217;s because
                                              it&#8217;s a really important one
                                              for me to have learned. She-Ra
                                              fights her rebellion not just with
                                              her magical sword and cool flying
                                              horse, but because she creates the
                                              United Nations Of Kick Ass Women
                                              (and Men Who Wear Crop Tops). Most
                                              of the other female characters are
                                              leaders in their own right, of
                                              different realms and even planets.
                                              Take that,
