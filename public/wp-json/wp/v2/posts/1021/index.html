  There are two things I want to get out of the way before I start telling you
  about the film today.\u00a0 Firstly:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:
  center;\"><strong
    >*** There are spoilers in this!***<\/strong><\/p>\n
    <p>
      Oh man.\u00a0 Three things, then.\u00a0
      <em
        >Three<\/em> things.\u00a0
        <em
          >Second <\/em>thing is, I am a dangerously massive fanboy for Warren
          Ellis.\u00a0 I don&#8217;t really like going into a film already
          biased either for or against its artistic merits, but I was
          practically eating my own face with anticipation for this one.<\/p>\n
          <p>
            And thirdly, I am also madly in love with Helen Mirren and Morgan
            Freeman.\u00a0 Helen Mirren is so badass I don&#8217;t know if I
            want to be her best friend or be her.\u00a0 Morgan Freeman&#8217;s
            voice alone turns me into a glowing pillar of delight.\u00a0 The
            mere fact that they are near each other, in the same shot sometimes,
            in
            <strong
              >RED <\/strong>(they&#8217;re on the poster!\u00a0 Both of
              them!\u00a0 Simultaneously!) is like cinematographical manna from
              heaven being fed directly into my brain through a
              <em
                >glee tube<\/em>.<\/p>\n
                <p>
                  So please remember that this film was seen through the eyes of
                  what was basically a person fully transformed into a ziggurat
                  of pure fandom; an obelisk of moist-eyed admiration.\u00a0
                  Consequently, any words that have issued from my fingers as I
                  type this have been vetted for inappropriate levels of fanboy,
                  but I can&#8217;t promise that I&#8217;ll have caught all of
                  them.\u00a0 I can promise, however, that I have done my
                  best.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  But first off &#8211; and I&#8217;d really like to get this
                  out of the way, because I think we all noticed it,
                  didn&#8217;t we &#8211; there&#8217;s one scene that made me
                  actually shout &#8220;NO!&#8221; in the cinema and made people
                  look at me in disgust (sorry, Vue Cambridge!).<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  Okay.\u00a0 The scene is this: Helen Mirren&#8217;s character,
                  Victoria, gets shot in the abdomen in such a way that she
                  genuinely thinks her life is at stake, and she prepares for a
                  final showdown, unarmed and bleeding from the gut, and then! a
                  man saves her.\u00a0 He literally sweeps her off her
                  combat-booted feet and whisks her off to safety.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is a clich\u00e9 that we have ingrained into our social
                  consciousness as thoroughly and as needlessly fictionally as
                  &#8220;frogs turn into princes when adequately
                  tongued.&#8221;\u00a0 &#8220;Woman cannot save self; man saves
                  woman.&#8221;\u00a0 At least the frog-kissing trope
                  doesn&#8217;t then translate across into how people commonly
                  regard frogs.\u00a0 But this &#8220;women are crap and need
                  saving&#8221; bollocks translates, doesn&#8217;t it?\u00a0 You
                  get it everywhere, from fairytales to adverts; this pointless,
                  condescending infantilism.\u00a0 This is a point at which I
                  would like to refer you to Bill Bailey&#8217;s magnificent <a

                  which tears the piss out of this trope perfectly.<\/p>\n

                    The most aggravating thing about it is that &#8211; well,
                    okay, some viewers may find that it made the re-emergence of
                    this clich\u00e9

                      types of arse in this.\u00a0 She has a free-mounted
                      machine gun.\u00a0 She blasts her way through waves of
                      drones with John Malkovich meekly in the background
                      handing her more guns.\u00a0 She explicitly changes out of
                      her heels into a nice pair of combat boots to handle the
                      violence.\u00a0 She knows surgery and hides guns under
                      flower-arranging.\u00a0 So, for me, to have her punctured
                      and enlimpened like a party balloon just made me want to
                      cry.<\/p>\n<div style=\"width: 560px\" class=\"wp-caption

                        That said, I was so delighted by her character that I

                        rather than sacrificed.\u00a0 So the

                        an epic-level character!\u00a0 She shouldn&#8217;t be

                              dialogue is hilarious, the action sequences
                              beautifully shot and choreographed, and the whole
                              thing is a visual feast.\u00a0 The characters are
                              chunky and believable &#8211; yes, including The
                              Girl, the love interest, the object of obsession
                              &#8211; and while they&#8217;re all deeply flawed
                              in some critical respect, they&#8217;re
                              likeable.<\/p>\n
                              <p>
                                Let&#8217;s take Bruce Willis&#8217;s character,
                                Frank.\u00a0 He&#8217;s the hero.\u00a0
                                He&#8217;s badass in pretty much every respect,
                                but his treatment of The Love Interest, Sarah
                                (Mary Louise Parker), at the beginning is
                                absolutely repulsive.\u00a0 We are right by her
                                side when she makes a bid for escape &#8211; it
                                doesn&#8217;t matter if what he says is best for
                                her and that we&#8217;ve seen his house shot to
                                pieces, the fact of the matter is that he has
                                BROKEN INTO HER HOUSE AND KIDNAPPED HER.\u00a0
                                As she says, &#8220;You can&#8217;t just go
                                around duct-taping people&#8221;.\u00a0 And we
                                can absolutely sympathise with her.\u00a0
                                She&#8217;s just an ordinary person.\u00a0 And
                                you

                                    I actually loved her to bits.\u00a0 She felt
                                    like someone I knew, and the scene where she
                                    brazens her way out of a Situation In A Lift
                                    is a spectacular testament to how ordinary
                                    people can rise to a challenge.\u00a0
                                    She&#8217;s great.\u00a0 Also, that&#8217;s
                                    a very gratifying example of her saving

                                        Interestingly, this film was given an
                                        opportunity to <a
                                        href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/2005\/10\/16\/badrepwiki-the-bechdel-test\/\">pass
                                        the Bechdel Test<\/a>.\u00a0 Sarah and
                                        Victoria are left alone in the snow,
                                        while Victoria takes aim at some
                                        kneecaps with a sniper rifle.\u00a0 They
                                        discuss Frank.\u00a0 And then Victoria
                                        threatens to kill Sarah and hide the
                                        body.\u00a0 So it had this whole
                                        assenting-to-trope\/subversion thing
                                        going on.\u00a0 The opportunity was
                                        there! But sadly missed!\u00a0 But I
                                        think it also does just go to show that
                                        a film doesn&#8217;t have to pass the
                                        Bechdel Test to also have brilliant
                                        female characters in (and visa versa:

                                            Because it does, you know.\u00a0
                                            It&#8217;s not just Sarah and
                                            Victoria (HELENNNN) that are
                                            brilliant in this; a tiny bit-part

                                            paranoid Marvin.\u00a0 He declaims
                                            her as following them, and having a
                                            gun in her handbag.\u00a0 This is
                                            awful; she is terrified and shaking,
                                            and Marvin is the bad guy. \u00a0And
                                            then, it is revealed that yes, she

                                              is a rocket launcher.\u00a0 And if
                                              that&#8217;s not brilliant, I
                                              don&#8217;t know what is.\u00a0
                                              The gun-wielding grunt role
