  Influential sci-fi author
  <strong
    >Joanna Russ<\/strong> died recently, aged 74. She was one of the first not
    only to be a major name in a male-dominated market, but to write
    specifically feminist SF.<\/p>\n
    <p>
      I&#8217;m only familiar with a tiny portion of her work, but there are
      many memorable quotes which immediately show just where she was coming
      from (thanks to
      <strong
        >Ian S<\/strong> who sent in the third one to our Facebook
        page!):<\/p>\n
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            &#8220;There are plenty of images of women in science fiction. There
            are hardly any women.&#8221; <\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            &#8220;Long before I became a feminist in any explicit way, I had
            turned from writing love stories about women in which women were
            losers, and adventure stories about men in which the men were
            winners, to writing adventure stories about a woman in which the
            woman won. It was one of the hardest things I ever did in my
            life.&#8221;<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            &#8220;In a perfect world, I would not have to be a feminist and gay
            activist, and I could spend my life discussing H.P.
            Lovecraft.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n

            an author who wrote in the same period but is now much more famous:
            <a
            href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ursula_K._Le_Guin\"><strong
              >Ursula Le Guin<\/strong><\/a>. What I didn&#8217;t know until
              yesterday was that Russ&#8217;s blistering short story &#8220;<A
              href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/When_It_Changed\"><strong
                >When It Changed<\/strong><\/a>&#8221; was directly inspired by
                Le Guin&#8217;s
                <strong
                  >The Left Hand of Darkness<\/strong>. Le Guin tried to break
                  down gender expectations by showing universality &#8211; in
                  <strong
                    >Left Hand<\/strong> she has a planet of genderless people.
                    What Russ was infuriated by was that the pronoun
                    &#8220;he&#8221; was still used in that novel by
                    default.<\/p>\n
                    <p>
                      Joanna Russ was not aiming for that universality &#8211;
                      she was all about binary. Her message wasn&#8217;t that
                      gender expectations shouldn&#8217;t be forced onto
                      individuals, it was that
                      <em
                        >women are oppressed by men. Right now<\/em>. Le Guin
                        was often much more subtle &#8211; despite many aspects
                        of feminism (and anti-patriarchy) in her most famous
                        books such as the
                        <strong
                          >Earthsea Trilogy<\/strong>, she wouldn&#8217;t be as
                          specific as this until she wrote <a
                          href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tehanu\"><strong
                            >Tehanu<\/strong><\/a>. In later novels such
                            as<strong>
                              Voices<\/strong> it is quite a few pages from the
                              start of the book before the reader even discovers
                              that the narrator is female &#8211; it is simply
                              not important. With Russ, it was central and
                              vital.<\/p>\n
                              <p>
                                It&#8217;s tempting to look at some of the first
                                feminist SF in the 1960s and 70s as being too
                                enthusiastic: less considered or accurate
                                because it had to shout twice as loud and was
                                opening new ground. Russ did shout loudly, but
                                she was dead right, and
                                <em

                                      the bookshop. It is only 8 pages long, and
                                      describes the coming of four men to a
                                      planet which suffered a plague 30
                                      generations ago; all the male colonists
                                      have died, and women now reproduce by
                                      artificial fertilisation. They marry,
                                      work, explore, fight duels, and it
                                      doesn&#8217;t occur to anyone that men
                                      could be part of the picture. When the
                                      four newcomers greet them, their
                                      assumptions are so alien that the two
                                      groups can barely hold a
                                      conversation.<\/p>\n

                                        nominated for a Hugo. It is bitterly
                                        sad, and the men&#8217;s repeated
                                        assurance that &#8220;they have sexual
                                        equality on Earth, now&#8221;
                                        doesn&#8217;t even sound likely to the

                                          could be instead. There is a version
                                          of the real world (at the time of
                                          writing); a much poorer America where

                                          short story; and a world where men and
                                          women are openly fighting a cold war
                                          against each other.<\/p>\n
