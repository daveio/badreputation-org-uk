<p>
  As is no secret, the final instalment in the
  <strong
    >Mass Effect<\/strong> trilogy was released on 9th March after months of
    buildup and anticipation. People weren&#8217;t just excited to see what
    would happen &#8211;
    <strong
      >Bioware<\/strong> &amp;<strong>
        EA<\/strong> also caused a bit of a stir with their marketing this time
        around. Here I&#8217;m going to look at trailers and the game&#8217;s
        packaging to see whether the good-fuss about their efforts to make a
        more gender-balanced campaign is well-deserved.<\/p>\n

          <p>
            You may remember that when I first burst onto the pages of BadRep I
            was talking about <a title=\"[Gamer Diary] RPG Advertising: Where
            Did All The Women Go?\"
            href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/2011\/05\/16\/gamer-diary-rpg-advertising-women\/\"
            target=\"_blank\">RPG advertising<\/a> and the distinct lack of
            women in these trailers, despite the games&#8217; built-in
            capability for you to play as a female protagonist. I mentioned
            <strong
              >Mass Effect<\/strong> advertisements, and no sooner had I
              criticised them than they announced they&#8217;d make a
              &#8216;FemShep&#8217; trailer and let the fans vote on what
              she&#8217;d look like. So I thought it&#8217;d only be right to
              address the marketing of
              <strong
                >ME3<\/strong> before I tell you all about the game
                <em
                  >itself.<\/em><\/p>\n
                  <p>
                    The<a title=\"Mass Effect 3 Debut Trailer\"
                    href=\"http:\/\/youtu.be\/BnEej1RfqTs\" target=\"_blank\">
                    first glimpses<\/a> we saw of
                    <strong
                      >Mass Effect 3<\/strong> didn&#8217;t show a female
                      Shepard; actually, they barely showed a male Shepard
                      either (but he was still there) &#8211; we were simply
                      teased with the knowledge that the war was coming to
                      Earth. Notably, the voiceover doesn&#8217;t say &#8220;if
                      <em
                        >he<\/em> doesn&#8217;t bring help&#8221; but just says
                        &#8220;Shepard&#8221; to avoid any issue of gender. But
                        <em
                          >then you see male Shepard&#8230; so, er, kinda
                          redundant there.<\/em><\/p>\n
                          <p>
                            When they first showed everyone <a title=\"Mass
                            Effect 3 FemShep Reinstated\"
                            href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3pShKKOV_gA\"
                            target=\"_blank\">FemShep<\/a>, to me, the trailer
                            didn&#8217;t have the same production quality that
                            it could have had, but they made this up with later
                            offerings, such as those below.<\/p>\n
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Next we have the Take Earth Back pair of trailers;
                            <a title=\"Mass Effect 3 Take Earth Back (male)\"
                            href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=KzKbIE7IM2o\"
                            target=\"_blank\">one male<\/a> and <a title=\"Mass
                            Effect 3 Take Earth Back Femshep\"
                            href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=KVz3roXf-Kc\"
                            target=\"_blank\">one female<\/a>. These two did
                            good. They&#8217;re the same, just with a different
                            version of Shepard in each. There&#8217;s no making
                            one look cooler, or more badass, than the other, and
                            that&#8217;s
                            <strong
                              >great<\/strong>. The pity is, though, that TV
                              channels didn&#8217;t really seem to pick up
                              FemShep&#8217;s version &#8211; I only ever saw
                              the male version being broadcast.<\/p>\n
                              <p>
                                Then we get to launch day and they start pushing
                                the <a title=\"Mass Effect 3 Launch Trailer\"
                                href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=AluTOOCVXVQ\"
                                target=\"_blank\">&#8216;Launch
                                Trailer&#8217;<\/a>, and as far as I can
                                discover, there&#8217;s only one version: Male
                                Shepard (or BroShep)&#8217;s version. This might
                                not be too bad; there&#8217;s a lot of female
                                characters shown &#8211; Ashley, Liara, Jack,
                                Miranda etc &#8211; and that&#8217;s more than a
                                lot of games can say at the moment. The thing
                                that ruins it, though, is the
                                <em
                                  >(totally unnecessary)<\/em> sex snapshot of
                                  Shepard bedding Ashley, who is the woman
                                  fighting beside you in the T.E.B. trailers I
                                  linked above.<\/p>\n
                                  <p>
                                    Of course, it could be argued that having
                                    <em
                                      >that<\/em> in the trailer shows how you
                                      can romance your team-mates if you so
                                      desire and that it&#8217;s an
                                      all-inclusive RPG experience. But it
                                      really isn&#8217;t necessary and is
                                      completely discordant with the rest of the
                                      trailer.<\/p>\n
                                      <h3>

                                          Here I can only talk about my box when
                                          it arrived, so there may have been
                                          people receiving differently presented
                                          games. When my game arrived the sleeve
                                          insert (that paper thing that slips
                                          under the plastic on the box) was
                                          displaying a proud BroShep on the
                                          front and back. I was a bit
                                          disappointed as I&#8217;ve never
                                          really thought much about Template
                                          BroShep&#8217;s appearance as part of
                                          my gaming experience.<\/p>\n

                                          the disc! The cover is reversible, so
                                          you can have FemShep on the front and
                                          on the back (though the screenshot
                                          inserts are still BroShep) if you take
                                          the insert out and flip it around.
                                          Obviously, I did this immediately so I
                                          didn&#8217;t have to look at

                                            reversibility is great, but you have
                                            to realise it&#8217;s available and
                                            then you have to do it
                                            yourself.<\/p>\n
