          <em

            all those other lovely hy- words, it<em>

                Think &#8216;hysterectomy&#8217;). There may be little trace of
                its origin in modern usage, but its &#8216;female&#8217;

                  But here we must pause, and take an exciting
                  medical-historical diversion. The Latin equivalent of
                  <em
                    >hysterikos <\/em>is the homonymic ancestor of our modern
                    term\u00a0&#8216;uterus&#8217;, and means &#8216;womb&#8217;
                    or &#8216;belly&#8217;; and this last strangely ambiguous
                    definition seems less odd when you realise that
                    &#8216;womb&#8217; itself, in its Old English form, refers
                    not to the generative organ but to a &#8216;belly&#8217; or
                    &#8216;paunch&#8217; and that history is full of scientists
                    arguing that this now-feminized organ was gender-neutral,
                    with the &#8216;female&#8217; womb simply some kind of
                    equivalent to the &#8216;male&#8217; stomach. Well? It does
                    have some kind of logic: both are cavernous places where
                    you, er, store stuff, but the female of the species may be
                    more creative than the male.<\/p>\n
