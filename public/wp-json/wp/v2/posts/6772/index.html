    &#8216;n&#8217; proud, the team were asked to take a look at their favourite

        \u201cEveryone knows my story. I get dressed up. The clock strikes
        twelve. I lose a shoe. And it\u2019s all downhill from there. My name is
        Cinderella, Cindy to my friends. Don\u2019t tell anyone, but I\u2019m a
        spy. One of the best, even if I\u2019m being humble. And there are times
        I love my job.\u201d <\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>&#8211; Cinderella, From Fabletown with Love<\/p><\/blockquote>\n</p>
      <p>
        Swapping the genders of characters around to put female characters in
        the roles usually filled by men and vice versa isn\u2019t anything
        shockingly new. But that doesn\u2019t make it any less cool when someone
        goes and does it well. Which, arguably, is exactly what <a
        href=\"http:\/\/dc.wikia.com\/wiki\/Cinderella_(Fables)\"><strong
          >Cinderella<\/strong><\/a> (in her spin-off miniseries from the
          <strong
            >Fables <\/strong> universe) does. (Note: this recommendation is
            based on the first volume of her tales, <a
            href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cinderella:_From_Fabletown_With_Love\"><strong
              >From Fabletown With Love<\/strong><\/a>. I haven\u2019t read the
              second arc yet,
              <strong
                >Fables Are Forever<\/strong>.)<\/p>\n
                <p>
                  Cinderella, as far as most of her fellow Fables know, is an
                  empty-headed fashionista, owner of the local shoe shop, and
                  one of Prince Charming\u2019s ex-wives. What most of them
                  don\u2019t know is that she\u2019s also a master spy and
                  sometimes assassin, their very own James Bond. Only
                  better.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  We open with Cinderella punching out a gun-toting mook, diving
                  off Big Ben\u2019s clock tower, and hang-gliding out over
                  London. It\u2019s one hell of an introduction and far from the
                  most kickass moment she gets in the book. Along the way, she
                  also finds time to kick the ever-loving crap out of some
                  shapeshifting monsters, storm an oil rig, deal with armed
                  assassins and overthrow an evil regime with a well-thrown
                  clog.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  So her badass credentials are certainly up to spec for the
                  super-spy genre, but what else? Well, it wouldn\u2019t be a
                  spy story without a Bond girl. That role here is ably filled
                  by Aladdin, Cinderella\u2019s intelligence-gathering
                  counterpart from the Baghdad Fable community. True to form
                  he\u2019s capable and effective but not quite up to
                  Cinderella\u2019s level and practically carries a glowing neon
                  sign reading \u201ccapture and imprison me so I can be
                  daringly rescued!\u201d.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are two particularly nice little points in the
                  interaction between Cinderella and Aladdin. First up, the
                  hook-up that\u2019s pretty much inevitable with the genre.
                  When it does happen, Cinderella is very definitely the active
                  party in deciding when and initiating things. There was the
                  risk that we\u2019d see that whole scene take a more
                  traditional approach, which would have entirely undermined the
                  character, but fortunately she remains entirely herself and
                  entirely in charge.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  The other nice moment is the ideological exchange between
                  them, shortly after they get done kicking monsters in the jaw
                  for the first time. The conversation comes round to Islam and,
                  honestly, it\u2019s handled pretty fairly. It\u2019s only one
                  page worth of stuff, but writer Chris Roberson deals with it
                  well. It\u2019s certainly a nice change from the slightly
                  cringe-inducing pro-Israel speech Bill Willingham included in
                  the main Fables series.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  The art is pretty solid too. At no point, as far as I can
                  tell, does Cinderella adopt <a
                  href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/2011\/04\/13\/found-feminism-tomorrow-when-the-war-began-film-poster-on-the-london-underground\/\">that
                  terrible spine-breaker pose<\/a> so commonly inflicted on
                  comic book women. The outfits are sensible too, with the
                  daring infiltration of an old oil platform taking place in
                  appropriate combat gear and her regular wear never getting any
                  more risqu\u00e9 than an evening dress. (Well, one of the
                  covers does feature a wetsuit with an inexplicable cleavage
                  window. Cleavage windows aside, Chrissie Zullo\u2019s work on
                  the covers is gorgeous.)<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_6773\"

                  So that\u2019s Cinderella, Fabletown\u2019s very own badass
                  super-spy. Hopefully she&#8217;s just as fantastic in her
                  second story arc. Oh, and she comes from good company too,

                  Totenkinder in particular is worthy of mention, since
