A Feminist Issue?"},"content":{"rendered":"
<p>
  This may be an odd way to open an article on a feminist website, but I love
  Robert Smith. I\u2019m one of the five people in the world who bought <a

  giant B-sides and rarities four-disc special edition CD<\/a> when it came out
  in 2007. So when I heard that the Cure were doing a two-and-a-half-hour set at
  this year\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bestival.net\/\">Bestival<\/a>, I
  packed my camping reservations in a rucksack and duly set off on the Friday to
  catch the last of our declining summer on the Isle of Wight \u2013 and my very
  first festival. So it goes.<\/p>\n

  \/><\/a>There\u2019s nothing that takes us back to basics more than camping.
  Take away the shower, the clean toilet, the puffs and powders and that whole
  sleep thing and you\u2019re playing on a level field. Or are you? After the
  first set, I watched as scores of men took to the fence, whipped their
  genitalia out, and relieved themselves with an efficiency almost amounting to
  elegance. Then a girl and her friend approached, one providing coverage to the
  other. Barely had she begun to unzip when a (female) security guard magically
  materialised \u2013 you can\u2019t do that. Use the portaloos, please.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  Now we can argue endlessly about the acceptability or otherwise of whipping
  any species of privates out in a public place, but surely if we\u2019re going
  basic for the weekend, we should all be as basic as each other? As for the
  portaloos themselves, well \u2013 the feminist implications of in-conveniences
  for the ladies have <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/2010\/11\/16\/ladies-room\/\">already
  been discussed in this very publication<\/a>, so I won\u2019t repeat them, but
  I will ask you to consider what happens when those using urinals also share
  the cubicles with those for whom this is not an option. And the queue-length
  that implies. All in all, I ended up feeling my experience had been inferior
  to my male companions\u2019 on account of my sex (and, in the case of the
  security guard, because of my gender, too). But others have had it
  worse\u2026<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  Managing events on this scale, however much it may be a British institution,
  comes with all kinds of questions around safety, both onstage and off. The
  dominant concern must always be to make people feel like they\u2019re living
  dangerously, when in fact they\u2019re safe as the proverbial houses.
  That\u2019s how you deliver a great live experience. No-one wants to feel
  on-edge all weekend, but no-one wants to feel mollycoddled either. After all,
  the teenagers who trash Reading Festival each year are trying to get away from
  their parents, and it\u2019s surely a given that any festival is riddled with
  drugs. Who cares?<\/p>\n

  \/><\/a>Festival Republic (who manage Glastonbury and run Latitude, Reading,
  Leeds and the Big Chill) took this thesis to its logical conclusion in 2010
  and significantly scaled down their police presence from the outset. The
  resultant spate of thefts was accompanied by <a
  href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Latitude_Festival#Security_at_Latitude_2010\">a
  gang rape on the first night, and a second instance on the second<\/a>.
  On-site, the organisers responded with that old chestnut about women not going
  around the site unaccompanied. Oh! There\u2019s that gender thing
  again.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  I find this particularly galling because there was a suspected instance of
  rape in the campsite I was staying in myself on the Saturday night at
  Bestival. It seemed to be a case of domestic abuse, but it\u2019s the height
  of irony that a festival attended by 30,000 people could be seen as a
  \u2018safe\u2019 space to take this toxically private crime outside its
  eponymous home. It\u2019s even more ironic that these crimes against women are
  occurring at events that are almost synonymous in many minds with the image of
  one very famous female \u2013 Kate Moss, whose \u2018festival style\u2019 was
  <a
  href=\"http:\/\/uk.news.yahoo.com\/moss-tops-festival-style-chart-230320589.html\">recently
  voted the most iconic festival fashion moment of all time<\/a>, beating Jimi
  Hendrix\u2019s tasseled white Glastonbury shirt. Rarely was it more truly
  spoken that one is never so alone as in a large crowd.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  The live events sector is a multi-million pound one, and <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/music\/2011\/sep\/15\/uk-festivals-bubble-burst\">despite
  this year\u2019s setbacks<\/a> (and the state of the economy more generally),
  it\u2019s still a growth industry long-term. Illegal downloading and the
  resultant changes to the music industry\u2019s economy will only make live
  music events of all sizes more important over the coming years. And with <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/lifeandstyle\/the-womens-blog-with-jane-martinson\/2011\/jun\/28\/beyonce-headlining-glastonbury-girl-power\">Beyonce
  this year becoming the first female headliner at Glastonbury in 20 years<\/a>
  and women like Kate Moss and Sienna Miller leading the style stakes,
  there\u2019s clearly a female voice coming through. Yet, as unpleasant as it
  undoubtedly is to admit, when something goes wrong, it\u2019s often the women
  who suffer \u2013 festivals are the perfect rape storm: scantily-clad girls
  (whose hemlines do not but may be perceived to = consent), large groups of
  drunk men (our neighbours serenaded us with a beautiful rendition of \u2018Get
  your rat out for the lads\u2019 at four in the afternoon on the Saturday),
  crowds that can easily separate you from your party, softly-softly security,
  copious amounts of drugs and large open spaces where people may hear your
  scream but probably won\u2019t realise, care about, or be in a state to deal
  with, its urgency. There\u2019s been evidence that <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.glastonburylineup.co.uk\/php\/shewee.php\">some live
  events companies are listening<\/a>, of course, and I don\u2019t want to
  suggest a doom-fest of misogyny either \u2013 but with the industry set for
  the boomtimes to come, I\u2019d like to be assured that festivals aren\u2019t
  a feminist issue.<\/p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div
