  Did you know that
  <strong
    >Daniel Radcliffe<\/strong> originally <a
    href=\"http:\/\/www.digitalspy.co.uk\/showbiz\/news\/a313526\/daniel-radcliffe-wanted-to-be-a-stand-up.html?rss\">wanted<\/a>
    to be a stand-up comedian? I was delighted to find this out, because in
    interviews and the like, he is basically the funniest person alive. His
    timing and delivery are dead on, and he&#8217;s got this sweet earnestness,
    like your favourite dog putting its chin on your knee.<\/p>\n
    <p>
      Naturally, these skills are directly applicable to his role as Arthur
      Kipps, a harrowed, traumatised, suicidal young single father-of-one sent
      to catalogue the creepy shit in a haunted house on some salt marshes in
      <strong
        >The Woman In Black<\/strong>. Obviously a laugh a minute, there. I can
        only assume he took the role determined to prove himself a Serious
        Actor, You Guys &#8211; which we&#8217;ll talk about in a minute. First,
        let&#8217;s talk about the actual story.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:

          <p>
            I&#8217;ve seen <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thewomaninblack.com\/\">the
            stage adaptation<\/a> of Susan Hill&#8217;s novel several times,
            because I love having the shit scared out of me. The scares in
            <strong
              >WiB<\/strong> come from Surprise. They&#8217;re things that jump
              out at you and say, &#8220;Boo&#8221;. Nothing more sophisticated
              than gribblies in the dark, which is a bit damning of me, but
              seriously &#8211; that&#8217;s all they are. They&#8217;re
              <em
                >good<\/em> at it, but I never find the horror in
                <strong
                  >WiB<\/strong> particularly horrifying.<\/p>\n
                  <p>
                    On stage, in the intimacy of seeing real life flesh-and-bone
                    players getting menaced by things in the dark renders the
                    jump-and-boo tactic of scare artistry very powerful, because
                    you all empathise together in a big knot; you notice what
                    the actors notice, when they notice them. Things can be
                    hidden and sneak about, and then you, as an audience, find
                    yourselves watching the scenery as much as the actors, and
                    the hidden gribblies play out in real time and it&#8217;s
                    all very nice and spooky.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_10256\"

                        the play by having Mr Radcliffe constantly off-centre in
                        shots and filling the space behind him with shapes that
