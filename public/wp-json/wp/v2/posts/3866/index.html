dress in Po, Burkina Faso, 8 March 2009. Photo writer&#39;s own<\/p><\/div>\n
<p>
  One of my oldest memories as a small child in Bulgaria is making a fuss over
  my mother on International Women&#8217;s Day. I remember making cards in
  school, and learning poems, and generally being really impatient to grow up so
  I would get to have a fuss made over me, too. Sure, there was Children&#8217;s
  Day, but it wasn&#8217;t a patch on Women&#8217;s Day. They got a bloody
  parade. A parade! Soon I, too, would grow up, and get to have a parade. Or
  possibly a statue. I hadn&#8217;t decided.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  Of course, my innocent dreams of grandeur were all for nought. A few years
  later we moved to the UK, and Women&#8217;s Day was banished to a vague memory
  of communism and its weird ideas. I got Mothering Sunday instead. The first
  time I opted for Mothering Sunday flowers and brunch instead of the usual
  Women&#8217;s Day, my mother thought I&#8217;d forgotten and burst into tears.
  Explaining I&#8217;d switched allegiance to a movable feast instead of a fixed
  day didn&#8217;t seem to win me many fans. And my father seemed relieved that
  he didn&#8217;t have to observe it, since, he pointed out, she was his wife
  and not his mother.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  Now, look. Those first tremulous years of transition were admittedly ropey,
  and it took a while for everyone to settle into their assigned roles. Mum
  yields to brunches and jewellery more easily now, and hasn&#8217;t demanded a
  formal poem or performative dance for the longest time. And my brother just
  signs his name next to mine on the card. But that&#8217;s not really the
  point.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  I&#8217;m starting to think we shouldn&#8217;t have made the transition in the
  first place. International Women&#8217;s Day was a celebration of being
  female, and an acknowledgement of women&#8217;s roles and contributions to
  society. One of the famous women we learned about in school was <a
  title=\"Valentina Tereshkova\"
  href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Valentina_Tereshkova\">Valentina
  Tereshkova<\/a> (sans tragic end), and I remember presenting my school teacher
  with a carefully constructed posy to acknowledge her position as educator.
  Admittedly, this was all orchestrated and ultimately about the glory of
  communism, so there are problems with it. But despite all that, I took from
  those few years of observing Women\u2019s Day a sense of pride at being
  female, and an impatience to be a woman.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  So let&#8217;s look at Mothering Sunday. Where to start? It&#8217;s a familial
  observance &#8211; you&#8217;re nice to your own mother to make up for setting
  the kitchen on fire that one time, and 24 hours of labour et cetera &#8211;
  and I&#8217;m under no obligation to be nice to any mothers I meet on my way
  home. Especially if they&#8217;re pushing those 4&#215;4 buggies. Also,
  it&#8217;s a presents-and-flowers day, where you buy gifts to show
  appreciation for being born and suckled and generally not dropped on your
  head. No one is actually expecting you to do anything differently the next
  day, your duties discharged with a pink book on frills and a wilted
  bouquet.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  Finally &#8211; and perhaps damningly &#8211; it only acknowledges one aspect
  of femininity. Mothering Sunday elevates mothering to the pinnacle of
  womanhood. What happens if your mother &#8211; much as you love her &#8211;
  just isn&#8217;t very good at this mothering malarkey? She tries her best, but
  curing cancer or trekking across the Arctic takes up a lot of time. I&#8217;m
  betting she feels a little silly looking at that cat illustration now.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  There are other problems. What about other women you owe great debts of
  gratitude to? What about the grandmothers, aunts, stepmothers, big sisters,
  best friends, teachers, mentors and supporters who cheerlead you throughout
  your life? Maybe we should have a separate day for each of them. I, for one,
  am looking forward to observing Second Cousin Twice Removed Day. They always
  threw the best parties.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  I find it problematic to have motherhood as the only aspect of womanhood that
  is nationally acknowledged. I find it problematic to have motherhood as a
  system of gratitude predicated upon familial links, rather than as an
  acknowledgement by society as a whole. Finally, I find it bloody annoying that
  my own accomplishments will not be acknowledged or celebrated by anyone, least
  of all in a parade. Quite frankly, sometimes I think that I &#8211; and all
  the amazing women I see around me &#8211; deserve a parade. And why not? It
  happens elsewhere in the world. Two years ago I was in the small town of Po,
  in southern Burkina Faso, on 8<sup
    >th<\/sup> March. The reason I was wandering around the country and not busy
    with an abacus is because International Women\u2019s Day is a Bank Holiday
    there. <a title=\"8th March around the world\"
    href=\"http:\/\/www.bank-holidays.com\/selectday_3_8.htm\">And not just
    there.<\/a><\/p>\n

        <p>
          In China, Russia and large parts of Africa, International Women\u2019s
          Day still flourishes.\u00a0 Even in places such as Iran<a title=\"8
          March 2007 in Iran\"
          href=\"http:\/\/hammerandbroom.blogspot.com\/2007\/03\/iranian-students-celebrate-march-8-2007.html\">
          there are still people eager to celebrate women&#8217;s
          contributions<\/a> and to show solidarity.\u00a0 There are still
          parades, and recitals, and girls waiting impatiently to grow up and
          have a day to be proud of being female. You could argue that, in the
          UK, many women would feel proud of being female much more often than
          that. You could point towards exam results, or women\u2019s
          achievements, or women\u2019s contribution to UK society.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          You\u2019d be wrong, I think. Of course, women achieve all of these
          things in the UK, and more. But when are these achievements
          acknowledged or celebrated?<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          When they give birth &#8211; and, a few months later, get their first
          pink Mother\u2019s Day card.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          Keep your cards and glitter pens. Bring back the parades.<\/p>\n<p
