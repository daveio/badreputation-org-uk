<p>Cookery was never my fort\u00e9.<\/p>\n</p>
<p>
  Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I have a history with kitchen equipment &#8211;
  it&#8217;s a sad, sad story involving a large quantity of Red Bull, an
  all-nighter at University, an offer of 50p, a camera, a toaster, and my
  genitals. The problem is that the output of my culinary bodgejobs tend to be
  either inedible, burned, or contain more cheese than the average human is
  capable of dealing with.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  It&#8217;s hard to deny that cookery is fun, though. Get in a kitchen, crack
  out all kinds of implausibly-shaped apparatus, put squishy and goopy and chewy
  things together, bung it in the oven, hope for the best. It&#8217;s like
  science, but with an end product that will either serve as your dinner or a
  cheaper alternative to Polyfilla.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  So, if you&#8217;re like me and you feel that, for the sake of all involved,
  cookery is best done vicariously &#8211; it saves on cleanup, anyway &#8211;
  fear not, because the Internet is here to help.<\/p>\n

  It Begins: Epic Meal Time<\/h2>\n

  </p>
  <p>
    <em
      >Epic Meal Time<\/em> is where it all started. A bunch of guys got
      together with a camera and made some brilliant, stupid food. The preview
      frame for each video contains a picture of the eldritch horror that is
      produced, along with its calorie count.<\/p>\n
      <p>
        Previous creations include their riff on the turducken &#8211; the <a
        href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7Xc5wIpUenQ\">TurBacon
        Epic<\/a> (79,046 calories, pictured above, and described as &#8216;a
        bird in a bird in a bird in a bird in a bird in a pig&#8217;), <a
        href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=jXjxHQQxcLw\">Fast Food
        Sushi<\/a> (11,816 calories of I assure you that you really don&#8217;t
        want to know), and the Valentine&#8217;s Day special &#8211; 190,400
        calories of &#8216;<a
        href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=i-rD2-pgMdM\">Super Sloppy
        Sundae<\/a>&#8216;.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        I think we can rest assured that this is the kind of cookery that would
        give Jamie Oliver an aneurysm, and the rest of us a nasty case of
        angina. And why the hell not? It&#8217;s your body, and you should
        choose exactly what you want to put into it. If you can have a good time
        with your friends in the process, so much the better.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        <em
          >Epic Meal Time<\/em> was brilliant, witty, and otherwise furiously
          entertaining for a long time. It got the idea that cooking could be a
          gentlemanly pursuit out there to a lot of eyeballs, and that has
          value. What ruined it though was, like so many things, its own
          success. Suddenly, the self-parodying bravado of this group of friends
          became actual bravado. A sponsorship deal and continuous references to
          &#8216;Internet Money&#8217; took the metaphorical axe to the
          humour.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_11209\" style=\"width: 310px\"

            It wasn&#8217;t just that, though. You can be damn certain that if
            I&#8217;m getting the arse on at something on BadRep, there&#8217;s
            a gender angle too, and sure enough, there is. When the bravado
            became too genuine, the continuous (and already tenuous) references
            to &#8216;bitches&#8217; went from problematic to outright
            misogynist. Attractive women started to feature in the videos
            &#8211; but only eating the food, never participating in its
            creation as part of the group. I can&#8217;t even remember a single

              eaten straight from the jar (&#8220;PRE DINNER SNACK. IT&#8217;S
              GOOD FOR YOU&#8221;). Butter was smeared by punching it. Cardboard
              packaging was opened with teeth. Water for boiling pasta was

                              it&#8217;s hard to avoid the fact that black metal
                              fandom is a subculture full of homophobia and
                              transphobia, and is often popularly associated
                              with Nazi music. It&#8217;s wonderful, then, that

                                subversive. It&#8217;s self-deprecating mockery
                                in which you&#8217;re invited to laugh with
                                someone at the sillier bits of their own
                                subculture, and that makes it a pleasure to
                                watch.<\/p>\n
