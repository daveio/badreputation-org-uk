<p>
  Well, I hope you all had a lovely summer! My August seems to have been a
  perpetual cycle of pre-rain, rain and post-rain, with varying levels of
  humidity just to keep things interesting. Good job I don&#8217;t mind staying
  inside, isn&#8217;t it? This month there hasn&#8217;t been much
  <em
    >new<\/em> that has taken my fancy &#8211; with the exception of
    <strong
      >Unmechanical<\/strong>, everything has mostly been new content or just
      new
      <em
        >to me.<\/em> August never seems to have much in the way of games, and
        moreover it tends to be the realm of the cinema releases. But
        we&#8217;re here to talk about games! Let&#8217;s get going.<\/p>\n
        <h3>
          Unmechanical<\/h3>\n

              >Unmechanical<\/strong><\/a> is a sweet indie puzzler that is<a
              title=\"Imgur album: Unmechanical\"
              href=\"http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/3lrRR\" target=\"_blank\"> pretty
              darn gorgeous<\/a> on the eyes too. It combines a variety of
              different puzzles (physics, logic, memory) on your quest for
              freedom through an underground labyrinth designed to feel at once
              organic and mechanical. You are a little blue helicopter thing
              that&#8217;s been abducted from the surface world and dropped into
              this maze. You can fly, and you have a tractor beam, but aside
              from bumping into things like a confused bee there&#8217;s not
              much else you can do. The way you navigate and solve puzzles
              relies on your interactions with stimuli around you, pulling
              levers and lifting rocks with your tractor beam to get the desired
              result. The puzzles range from the fairly familiar &#8211; like
              the remember-the-pattern puzzle involving four different coloured
              bulbs that make different noises &#8211; to the far-reaching and
              complicated. It&#8217;s great fun and a well-composed title
              &#8211; there&#8217;s a neat bit of thinking alongside the
              Aww-Factor -and it&#8217;s available through a variety of digital
              content platforms (<strong

                                          should you so desire to, you can also
                                          pay to enter &#8220;Mann Up
                                          Mode&#8221; in which you can get the
                                          chance to win rare items as a reward
                                          for completing missions and the Tour
                                          of Duty. Currently there&#8217;s only
                                          one Tour of Duty (&#8220;Steel
                                          Trap&#8221;) consisting of six
                                          missions; in Mann Up Mode you have to
                                          pay with a Tour of Duty Ticket for
                                          each mission, and these are 59p\/99c

                                            Lured by the promise of rare items,
                                            I paid to get into Mann Up Mode and
                                            completed a Tour. Unlike my partner,
                                            who has now completed three Tours
                                            and hasn&#8217;t had any
                                            SuperCoolRares, I got a rare item at
                                            the end of my Tour. Woo!
                                            That&#8217;s not the best thing I
                                            want to talk about, though. The
                                            Co-op mode itself is pretty awesome,
                                            and a great addition to TF2, because
                                            for once you

                                              even if you aren&#8217;t Pro, with
                                              a bunch of people you have been
                                              allocated. It can create a really
                                              fun atmosphere if you get a good
                                              &#8211; and nice &#8211; team. The
                                              robot army you have to defeat
                                              presents a challenge if you
                                              don&#8217;t learn quickly how to
                                              coordinate and function as a team.
                                              Normal multiplayer doesn&#8217;t
                                              tend to require this much
                                              interaction with other humans
                                              (unless you&#8217;re a pre-formed
                                              team who know what they&#8217;re
                                              doing) and so the update has
                                              successfully added a new dimension
                                              to the experience of
                                              <strong
                                                >TF2<\/strong>. Needless to say,
                                                however, if you get a rubbish
                                                team with too many ill-informed
                                                egomaniacs, you won&#8217;t get
