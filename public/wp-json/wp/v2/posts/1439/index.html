          >Queen <\/em>is\u00a0one of the few Alphabet words with a
          firmly\u00a0British<em>
            <\/em>origin, but it makes up for its lack of Latinate pedigree by
            being extremely complicated. So this is the part where the rap
            breaks down &#8211; it comes from the Old English
            <em

              <em

                proto-Indo-European\u00a0<em
                  >gwen<\/em> (= &#8216;woman, wife&#8217;). Proto-awesome, man.
                  In this form it coincides rather nicely with the

                            languages that I don&#8217;t think we need all up in

                                The interesting thing about these origins is
                                their relation to another word:
