  When Hitchcock&#8217;s\u00a0<strong
    >Psycho<\/strong> came out in 1960, its shower scene was instantly a
    sensation. Three minutes and fifty cuts, it broke rules previously
    sacrosanct: for starters, coming about forty minutes into the film, it
    killed off Janet Leigh, the film&#8217;s protagonist &#8211; with whom the
    audience had been invited to identify from those first opening shots of her
    carefully nondescript underwear.\u00a0Not only this, its fifty cuts served
    the purpose of (in the director&#8217;s own words) &#8216;transferring the
    menace from the screen into the mind of the audience&#8217;. Viewers were no
    longer the blonde; they were the psycho. An uncomfortable shift.<\/p>\n

      <strong
        >Silver Linings Playbook<\/strong>, the menace is all in in the mind
        &#8211; it&#8217;s a film about mental illness. It is presumably for
        this reason that director David O. Russell has chosen to reproduce that
        shower scene in it &#8211; though, represented via a series of
        individual flashbacks, he&#8217;s added some more visceral cuts into it,
        as well as a middle-aged professor who&#8217;s having an affair with
        this Norman Bates&#8217;s wife.<\/p>\n
        <p>
          The film follows Pat (Bradley Cooper), who is bipolar, and his quest
          to get his marriage back together after returning home from a
          psychiatric hospital. We learn that his most recent breakdown was
          precipitated on discovering his wife Nikki in the aforementioned
          shower with a colleague; he attacked the man, which brought him up
          against assault charges and eventually landed him in the institution.
          Back home at the beginning of the film, Pat wants to get Nikki, and
          his marriage, back &#8211; despite his continuing mood swings, refusal
          to take medication and restraining order.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          Then he meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a young woman whose husband
          has recently died in traumatic circumstances. She is similarly
          Troubled (she&#8217;s been fired for sleeping with all her co-workers)
          and they hit it off, in a vague way. She agrees to take a letter to
          Nikki if Pat will partner her in a dance competition.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>The inevitable happens.<\/p>\n</p>

          listen to Hollywood, there\u00a0are dance competitions happening in
          every small town, every three minutes, just waiting for someone to do
          some self-actualisation through dance &#8211; as in dance movie
          stalwarts such as
          <strong
            >Strictly Ballroom<\/strong>,\u00a0<strong

              Council-funded\u00a0<strong
                >Billy Elliot<\/strong>. This one brings plenty of opportunities
                for personal development, which &#8211; though not so pronounced
                as the ur-dance movies &#8211; is actually why Pat agrees to do
                it: he wants to prove to Nikki that he has changed, and grown,
                since the shower incident. Cinematic history tells him this is
                the way to do it.<\/p>\n

                    dance is not really the point: the dancing pops up towards
                    the second half of the film, and while the rehearsals do

                                Now, personally, I didn&#8217;t find the
                                treatment of mental health as offensive as I
                                know some did &#8211; David O. Russell has
                                commented in interviews that he drew a lot from
                                the experience of having a son with bipolar
                                disorder, which does help. One thing that did
                                bug me, though, was its pairing of a bipolar man
                                with longstanding mental health issues with a
                                hypersexual woman recovering from a traumatic
                                bereavement. Pat&#8217;s problems are
                                longstanding, but Tiffany&#8217;s troubles
                                clearly have their origin in grief, and they
                                happen to manifest themselves in a pattern of
                                sexual behaviour that, as recounted, elicits
                                visible salivation from her male companion. We
                                might say, in fact, that in this film, there is
                                Serious Mental Illness, and there is Sexy Mental
                                Illness. That Pat&#8217;s initial crime puts him
                                in the cinematic shoes of Norman Bates, whose
                                murder is at root sexually motivated &#8211;
                                though it is repeated here as a grotesque
                                husband-on-lover attack &#8211; underscores
                                this, though admittedly at one remove.<\/p>\n
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                This is why the\u00a0<strong
                                  >Psycho<\/strong> crib, for me, was a key
                                  moment &#8211; and partly because its
                                  appearance in the film is so downright weird.
                                  It parallels the dance competition trope as an
                                  interjection of popular film history, but I
                                  suppose it also draws together some of the
                                  film&#8217;s key themes: notably, though
                                  arguably ironically, psychosis
                                  (Hitchcock&#8217;s film played a major part in
                                  popularising the slang word\u00a0<em
                                    >psycho<\/em>) and what you might very
                                    crudely call Hollywood
                                    &#8216;monster-cam&#8217;.<\/p>\n
                                    <p>
                                      I suppose one reason for including the
                                      scene (something I spent a long time
                                      puzzling over) was that, by putting the
                                      audience in the eye-view of a man
                                      mid-breakdown unleashing his rage upon two
                                      people who happen to be naked (and one of
                                      them a woman) shows the terrible power of
                                      the mental threats the film explores: we
                                      see their vulnerability, and we are
                                      invited to consider the gender issues the
                                      attack brings to the surface. Within the
                                      context of the plot, it makes sense of
                                      Nikki&#8217;s need for a restraining order
                                      and perhaps even makes an ironic comment
                                      on the thigh-rubbing Hitchcock is widely
                                      accepted to have been doing throughout his
                                      own shower scene. It certainly makes you
                                      think back to the portrayal of mental
                                      illness in the deeply

                                            seeing &#8211; despite those dodgy
