  This week I went along to see <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.ovalhouse.com\/whatson\/detail\/tomboy-blues\"><strong
    >Tomboy Blues: The Theory of Disappointment<\/strong><\/a> at South
    London&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ovalhouse.com\/\"><strong
      >Oval House Theatre<\/strong><\/a> as part of their &#8220;Lady-led&#8221;
      season. The play is a two-hander written and performed by nat tarrab and
      Rachel Mars. Together, they form the cunningly named <a
      href=\"http:\/\/www.marstarrab.co.uk\/\"><strong
        >mars.tarrab<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n
        <p>
          I got an insight into their work, and into their minds, before
          I&#8217;d even gotten into the auditorium. Alongside the programme
          (with its photo of a barbie doll <a
          href=\"http:\/\/www.ovalhouse.com\/images\/made\/Tomboy_web_crop_460_209_s_c1.jpg\">shoved
          into a pair of boxer shorts<\/a> worn by an androgynous figure) was
          something that looked like one of those ghastly tick-box
          questionnaires. Except it wasn&#8217;t. Instead, it presented a
          whimsical but pertinent checklist about the performers (tall\/small),
          the show and how you could get involved to help them (cake baking or
          pant sewing) with future projects.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_8449\"

          The play is an hour long and it&#8217;s about tomboys. Hurrah!
          It&#8217;s also about the challenges of growing up feeling confined by
          limited gender options, and the accompanying problems of underwear, of
          going into the &#8220;right&#8221; toilet, of working out who you are,
          who you want to be, and how to fall in love and be yourself. The pair
          use pseudo-science, white labcoats and some strange experiments
          alongside clownful vignettes, sad stories and bizarre situations that
          describe accurately, and often painfully so, the experience of\u00a0
          &#8220;disappointment&#8221; &#8211; how our hopes and expectations of
          life can fall short when we&#8217;re confronted with the brick wall of
          &#8220;what is expected&#8221;.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          I especially loved the physicality of the two performers, their deft
          ownership of the space, as well as the glimmer of the personal at the
          edges of their characterisation. It&#8217;s funny and very, very
          heartfelt &#8211; I found myself watching bits of my own childhood and
          teenage experience onstage. The awkward, clumsy, strangeness of having
          a cis female body but not feeling especially feminine, and not feeling
          sure that was allowed, or sure of how to be
          &#8220;in-between&#8221;.<\/p>\n

                The show ended with a discussion with <a
                href=\"http:\/\/www.genderedintelligence.co.uk\/\"><strong
                  >Gendered Intelligence<\/strong><\/a>, who work to help
                  improve awareness of gender issues in the public sphere,
                  especially amongst young people. We talked about the word
                  &#8220;queer&#8221; and what it meant, about how tomboyism
                  might sit under the queer umbrella, and about anxieties of
                  perhaps not feeling &#8220;queer enough&#8221; sometimes as a
                  person happy within their body yet unhappy with the social
                  requirements of being feminine.<\/p>\n<div

                    I also managed to catch up with nat and Rachel via email, to

                      intrigued about each other&#8217;s work, histories and
                      bodies. We made our first show,

                                work comes, foremostly, from ourselves and our
                                experience. When we were getting to know each
                                other we found places of similarity and
                                difference, and the common tomboy childhood (and
                                adulthood) was ticklish to us to explore.
                                nat&#8217;s friends were having kids, she was
                                looking again at childhood and was alarmed at
                                how often it still is &#8216;pink for a girl and
                                blue for a boy&#8217; even in these supposedly
                                broken open gender dialogue times. It was also
                                the time of <a

                                    mothers and fathers, and ourselves, and we
                                    looked at current consumer trends (and their
                                    attackers, like <a
