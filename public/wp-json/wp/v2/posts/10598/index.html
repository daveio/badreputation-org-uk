  Yep. That Game. That Ending. And all that commotion. There&#8217;s very little
  need to introduce the game, or the franchise. I&#8217;m going to take a wild
  guess that you&#8217;ve all probably heard of it. I alone have mentioned it in
  <a href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/tag\/gamer-diary\/\">almost every
  post<\/a> I&#8217;ve done since the start of the year. If in doubt, check out

    you may have.<\/p>\n
    <p>
      I will try not to be too exclusive in my content here, so I&#8217;ll try
      to avoid anything that you won&#8217;t understand unless you&#8217;ve
      played the game, and I&#8217;ll be focussing on the game through a
      feminist lens. That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re trying to do over here, after
      all, right? One last thing to say is&#8230; <span style=\"text-decoration:

            <p>
              I thought I&#8217;d get this out of the way as I reckon
              there&#8217;s very little feminist critique one can offer on this
              side of things. I played on a PC, so some of my concerns
              won&#8217;t be shared with console gamers, most obviously the
              power required in your machine to play the game. As a PC gamer,
              you have keep your technology up to speed with new titles, but
              console versions come as-is to the standardised specifications of
              the machines. My computer isn&#8217;t the fastest, or the most
              hardworking &#8211; it&#8217;s actually just a dual-core with one
              graphics card, several series behind the most recent, not for lack
              of will but for lack of cash. Keeping a PC up to date is
              expensive.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              My reason for telling you that is so I can tell you how well my
              absolutely-not-top-of-the-range PC handled a brand new,
              heavy-hitting title like
              <strong
                >Mass Effect 3<\/strong>. &#8220;Not too bad&#8221; is the
                answer. At times, faces looked a mite too angular, but I had no
                problems running the game at all.<\/p>\n
                <p>
                  The game mechanics are almost the same as the were in the
                  previous instalment, and although they can be a bit
                  frustrating to get used to for the first time, they work well
                  within the context of the game. I have heard complaints on the
                  overuse of the spacebar &#8211; that it is assigned to far too
                  many actions &#8211; and although I had no issues with it, my
                  partner did, so I suspect it&#8217;s a personally variable
                  thing.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  Combat has been streamlined slightly since
                  <strong
                    >Mass Effect 2<\/strong>, and you still have to learn how to
                    fight with each different class you can choose for Shepard.
                    For example, I played through first as an Adept, who enjoys
                    a lot of long-range Biotic powers, so you don&#8217;t always
                    need to leave cover and use guns; then I started in a
                    different class and had problems adapting to the new
                    style.<\/p>\n
                    <p>
                      <strong
                        >Some Femi-Relevant Content<\/strong><\/p>\n
                        <p>
                          As much as I could, I shouldn&#8217;t spend my entire
                          word count talking about mechanics and gameplay here,
                          so we&#8217;ll move on. While playing the game I had a
                          little list of things to look out for that I could
                          critique or criticise, and honestly, there
                          wasn&#8217;t much I could pick out. You don&#8217;t
                          get treated differently if you&#8217;re a male or a
                          female character. The only notable difference I found
                          was in a conversation with the female Krogan,
                          Eve\/Bakara, in which she says &#8220;we&#8217;ll show
                          these men how to do things!&#8221; (or similar) if
                          you&#8217;re a &#8216;FemShep&#8217;, but not if
                          you&#8217;re male.<\/p>\n
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The only sexism we see comes from the Krogans; Urdnot
                          Wreav claims that Eve is
                          <em
                            >his<\/em> and that she is obliged to father all his
                            children as he rescued her. Eve, however, is having
                            none of it. That&#8217;s good. Eve is
                            awesome.<\/p>\n
                            <p>
                              One issue many players had with
                              <strong
                                >Mass Effect 2<\/strong> was the fact that if
                                you wanted the &#8216;Romance&#8217; achievement
                                you had to initiate a heterosexual relationship.
                                This has been addressed &#8211; you can now gain
                                the &#8216;Paramour&#8217; achievement through
                                any (albeit still sexual) relationship. There
                                are a more visibly present non-hetero characters
                                too: at one point you console your shuttle pilot
                                who is upset over the death of his husband.
                                It&#8217;s never shown in a &#8220;LOOK OVER
                                HERE! I&#8217;M GAY! HAPPY NOW?!&#8221; manner;
                                it&#8217;s much more realistically handled in
                                that a character may mention something that
                                discloses their orientation, but ultimately all
                                questions of the personal kind are of little
                                consequence in the face of the impending problem
                                of Total Annihilation Of All Life In The
                                Universe.<\/p>\n

                                  I was very happy not to have any feminist
                                  niggles or femirage over the game &#8211;
                                  perhaps that does somewhat diminish my options
                                  for what to write for this, a feminist, blog!
                                  The best thing that I can say is that it is
                                  quite feminist-friendly and the only things I
                                  could suggest improving would be the inclusion
                                  of non-binary genders and equal
                                  cutscenes-for-sex with all races\/species (I
                                  got no sexy cutscene for my (F)Human-(M)Turian
                                  coupling, but one trailer shows a

                                    Before I conclude, I was content and pleased
                                    with the ending. Apparently, I may be in a
                                    minority there. My partner, for example,
                                    hated it. Basically &#8211;

                                      pretty much everyone dies. BioWare went to
                                      town on the
                                      <em
                                        >deus ex machina<\/em> mechanism here.
                                        Yes, Shepard pretty much dies no matter
                                        what you do.<\/p>\n
                                        <p>
                                          I was happy with that. I thought
                                          BioWare were very brave to stick
                                          behind such a potentially contentious
                                          ending, and they enacted it
                                          beautifully. Many on the interwebs
                                          were in uproar, and appeared to
                                          successfully bully BioWare into
                                          announcing that <a title=\"BioWare

                                          suppose it was difficult to respond to
                                          fan requests for a FemShep trailer,
                                          then stonewall on the Ending Issue,
                                          but it would&#8217;ve been nice if
                                          they&#8217;d held their ground and
                                          kept a smidge of artistic
