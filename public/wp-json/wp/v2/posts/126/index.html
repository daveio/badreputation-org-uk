<p>
  &#8220;A film that calls itself feminist?&#8221; I said, looking up from my
  morning internet. &#8220;Well, that makes me suspicious from the START.&#8221;
  I said this, because it did. I&#8217;m always a bit cautious about Feminist
  Films. For every one that&#8217;s dead on, intelligent and insightful,
  there&#8217;s one that&#8217;s the embarassing uncle at the party who asks you
  all about your love life in inappropriate detail and then tries on all your
  shoes.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  Anyway, I watched the <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt1371155\/\">trailer<\/a>, and my heart
  sank even further. No, really! It literally did. I became extremely afraid
  that, with a film made, all feelgood and by the same people who did
  <strong
    >Calendar Girls<\/strong>, it&#8217;d fictionalise the
    <em
      >ongoing<\/em> struggle for equality in the workplace and make it seem,
      well, like the battle was fought and won, and like we have nothing left to
      strive for. Which, of course, we do.<\/p>\n
      <p>So you see my trouble here.<\/p>\n</p>
      <p>
        But, as with all films when I can feel my rage glands engorging with
        fluid before I&#8217;ve even laid eyeball to celluloid, I chastised
        myself for being a judgemental prick, and went to see it anyway. I
        trotted into the darkness, full of hope and tea. The cinema was full of
        middle-aged women all talking about exciting and intelligent things (the
        couple next to me were discussing Wagner) so I felt, as a 20-something
        bleach-blond chap in skin-tight jeans, somewhat out of place.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        On came the film, and dear god, I wished that there could have been more
        people my age watching in that audience. I mean, I totally get it. I
        understand why all the ladies of that generation were there &#8211; that
        was their time and their history. But it&#8217;s
        <em
          >our<\/em> history too, and a very vicious and triumphant reminder of
          the battles fought and the ground yet to be covered. The dynamics
          shown there, right there on the screen, are things we still have to
          deal with every day. There are still men who think that they&#8217;re
          meant to be the prime breadwinners. There are still women who
          won&#8217;t speak up about what they think or believe because they
          assume that they&#8217;re wrong because a man will know better. That
          shit still happens.<\/p>\n
          <p>
            So yeah, basically all my fears were allayed with one toss of
            Miranda Richardson&#8217;s head. This is not a film
            <em
              >about<\/em> feminism &#8211; this is a film about gender politics
              that has feminism firmly in mind. It is not merely
              <em
                >observant<\/em> of its subject matter, it
                <em
                  >understands<\/em> it. And that&#8217;s a delicious and
                  refreshing thing in a time of Sarah Palin&#8217;s
                  &#8220;Pro-Life Feminism&#8221; and other such horrors.<\/p>\n
                  <p>
                    Let me give you an example. I don&#8217;t want to give too
                    much away, but there&#8217;s an argument in the film between
                    a married couple, and the man extols his virtues as a
                    &#8220;good husband&#8221; by saying that he&#8217;s never
                    hit his wife or children, and that he gets involved with his
                    kids and looks after them. The wife stares and hisses,
                    &#8220;And that&#8217;s
                    <em
                      >as it should be.<\/em> It&#8217;s not
                      <em
                        >privilege<\/em>, it&#8217;s simple, basic
                        <em
                          >rights.<\/em>&#8221;<\/p>\n
                          <p>
                            And then I cried! Burst into tears right there in
                            the cinema. It doesn&#8217;t take much to make me
                            get the waterworks out at a film, but that got me
                            right there. Basic fucking rights. And people still
                            don&#8217;t understand that. Still! And this is
                            2010!<\/p>\n
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            The characters in this are sublime &#8211;
                            immediately engaging and empathic &#8211; and Connie
                            (Geraldine James) is by far my favourite.
                            You&#8217;ll understand if you&#8217;ve seen it, or
                            when you do see it &#8211; she&#8217;s so viscerally
                            human, her torment and psyche so completely,
                            perfectly explicable that I felt like I knew her,
                            like she lived round the corner from me and I saw
                            her for tea every Saturday afternoon. These are
                            <em
                              >real<\/em> stories about
                              <em
                                >real<\/em> women, and it&#8217;s a lovely touch
                                that they get the actual Dagenham strikers
                                talking about their own experiences at the
                                credits. It feels very concrete and real &#8211;
                                which, of course, it is &#8211; but it certainly
                                doesn&#8217;t feel saccarine or fictional, which
                                is what I&#8217;d feared.<\/p>\n
                                <p>
                                  I&#8217;m now trying to think of The Stand-Out
                                  Moment of this film, but there&#8217;s so
                                  many, I don&#8217;t know where to start! A
                                  good thing, right? Well, from a personal bent,
                                  the stand-out holy-shit-I-identify-with-this
                                  moment for me was the best-ever male-ally
                                  speech (you&#8217;ll know it when you see it!)
                                  from a man who said that he was raised by his
                                  mother, who was the prime breadwinner, but on
                                  so much less than her male counterparts
                                  despite doing the same work, if not
                                  more.<\/p>\n
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  Let me tell you a little personal thing: I was
                                  raised primarily by my absolute saint of a
                                  mother, who is paid two-thirds of what her
                                  male counterparts get, despite actually doing
                                  more than them. She is labelled a
                                  &#8220;part-time worker&#8221;, because she
                                  may at any point become pregnant and leave her
                                  job to have babies, because she&#8217;s a
                                  woman. My mum is 50. AND THIS IS 2010. This
                                  struggle is current! This is happening right
                                  now! Equal Pay Act or no Equal Pay Act, there
                                  is still inequality in the workplace and in
                                  society at large that makes it seem okay and
                                  &#8220;normal&#8221; to treat women like
                                  they&#8217;re second class goddamn
                                  citizens.<\/p>\n
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  So there I was, steaming in my seat, tumescent
                                  and tremulous with the wrath of social
                                  injustice, but really having an amazing
                                  cinematic experience. Oh &#8211; another cool
                                  thing: the film is colour-treated so that it
                                  resembles vintage Sixties film. It&#8217;s not
                                  overdone &#8211; just a little desaturation
                                  and colour work &#8211; but just enough to
                                  evoke the televisual &#8220;feel&#8221; of the
                                  era. It really works. Loved it.<\/p>\n
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  Naturally, as a nit-picking little bastard who
                                  isn&#8217;t happy until he&#8217;s poked
                                  seventeen holes in a thing, I found something
                                  to grumble about after all. Hooray! Okay
                                  &#8211; get this: at the end of the film,
                                  you&#8217;ve got vintage footage of the actual
                                  strikers. They&#8217;re all middle-aged and
                                  big. Well, certainly bigger than the younger,
                                  sexy ladies they&#8217;ve got to play their
                                  roles in the actual film. They&#8217;ve been
                                  sexed up. Oh god. What&#8217;s right about
                                  that? Are the Lords and Ladies Cinema esquire
                                  <em
                                    >really<\/em> saying that we, as audience
                                    members, cannot possibly empathise with our
                                    lead characters unless they&#8217;re
                                    stereotypically easy on the eye?<\/p>\n
                                    <p>
                                      I raised this point through a mouthful of
                                      curry at my friends after the film. One of
                                      them suggested that this could be a
                                      deliberate choice on the part of the
                                      filmmakers to combat the stereotype that
                                      women who fight for women&#8217;s rights
                                      are unattractive craggy battleaxes, and I
                                      think I&#8217;m okay with that. Well,
                                      okay-er with that. Chewing out that
                                      horrible stereotype is always a win in my
                                      book. That said, I&#8217;m a big fan of
                                      craggy old battleaxes. Long live the
                                      battleaxe!<\/p>\n
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                      Overall, it&#8217;s a good film.
                                      It&#8217;s inspiring, it&#8217;s moving,
                                      and it&#8217;s satisfying like when you
                                      add an entire pot of double cream to a
                                      pasta sauce. Super.<\/p>\n
