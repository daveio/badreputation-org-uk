    >Maria Gaetana Agnesi<\/strong> (1718\u20131799), by contrast, was a quiet
    type who lived most of her life in seclusion and finished her days in a
    convent. So what made her awesome? Well, for one thing she was a
    particularly prodigious polymath of skull-burstingly intense genius.
    There\u2019s more than that too, but it makes a good place to start.<\/p>\n
    <p>
      Born in Milan to a wealthy silk merchant who had married into nobility,
      Agnesi was the oldest of 21 children (gigantic families apparently being a
      running theme amongst the people featured in this series). She was pretty
      much as prodigious as child prodigies come, speaking both French and
      Italian by the age of five, and Latin soon after.<\/p>\n<div

    <p>
      Her Latin was put to the test at the age of nine, when she began doing
      public salons and debates, organised by her father. Agnesi prepared a
      lengthy speech arguing for women&#8217;s right to education, translated it
      into Latin, and delivered it to a gathering of local intellectuals. Most
      of us, I think, at age nine, would have settled for doing well on a
      classroom mental arithmetics test, maybe getting a gold star on a spelling
      quiz. But no, Agnesi was intellectually amazing, so she jumped right past
      those and straight to giving lectures in a foreign language on
      controversial topics. As you do.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the next few years Agnesi would continue to deliver these speeches
      and take part in debates \u2013 learning Greek, Hebrew, Spanish and German
      along the way, so that she could talk to her audience in their native
      languages. She ended up giving several hundred talks, and gathered around
      two hundred of these which were published as the
      <strong
        >Propositiones Philosophicae<\/strong> in 1738. For those of you keeping
        track at home, that makes seven languages learned, hundreds of serious
        debates from age nine onwards, and one weighty tome published, all by
        the age of 20.<\/p>\n

            might be understood by all. She answered him well, after which they
            entered into a dispute, in the same language, on the origin of
            fountains and on the causes of the ebb and flow which is seen in
            some of them, similar to tides at sea. She spoke like an angel on
            this topic, I have never heard anything so remarkable&#8230;<\/p>\n

                Agnesi did not particularly enjoy the public life of the
                intellectual, however, and at age 20 asked to be allowed to join
                a convent. The request was denied, but she was able to
                semi-withdraw from the world at home, eschewing social
                interaction in favour of an almost convent-esque lifestyle
                within the family household. When she wasn\u2019t tutoring her
                vast army of siblings, she devoted her time to the study of
                maths, particularly the fields of differential and integral
                calculus \u2013 still relatively new at the time, having only
                been formalised in European circles by <a

                        Following her father\u2019s death in 1752, Agnesi was
                        appointed Professor of Mathematics at the university of
                        Bologna by Papal decree. She was the first woman to be
                        appointed to the role of professor in a European
                        university. You know you\u2019re a shining example of
                        sheer genius when the
                        <em
                          >Pope himself<\/em> decides to say \u201cto hell with
                          traditional gender roles, I want this person made a
                          professor!\u201d.<\/p>\n
                          <p>
                            Agnesi considered the professorship to be an
                            honourary role, and never actually set foot in the
                            university or taught a class, though by all accounts
                            it would actually have been a proper position had
                            she wanted it. Instead, no longer feeling obligated
                            to stay at home for her father, she devoted herself
                            to theology. She became the director of the <a
                            href=\"http:\/\/www.musee-orsay.fr\/en\/collections\/works-in-focus\/painting\/commentaire_id\/feast-day-at-the-hospice-trivulzio-20566.html?tx_commentaire_pi1[pidLi]=509&amp;tx_commentaire_pi1[from]=841&amp;cHash=00e8962cb3\">Hospice
                            Trivulzio<\/a>, working to provide for the poor and
                            the sick. She remained there until her death,
                            putting all of her not inconsiderable wealth into
                            charitable works, and dying a pauper at the age of
                            81.<\/p>\n
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            So there you have it. Seven languages, two books,
                            the first female professor by appointment of Pope
                            Benedict XIV, and decades of selfless charity work.
                            That\u2019s a pretty damn good body of evidence in
                            favour of Agnesi being brain-blisteringly
                            awesome.<\/p>\n
