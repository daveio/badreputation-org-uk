  I can&#8217;t write a political or historical retrospective on Thatcher, on
  her life or her works. If I did, it might come out like\u00a0<a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/politics\/2013\/apr\/09\/russell-brand-margaret-thatcher?INTCMP=SRCH\"
  target=\"_blank\">the Russell Brand piece<\/a>, only a bit more Northern, a
  bit more reflective on her impact on feminism.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  I&#8217;ve read and seen far too much already over the past few days, from
  endless eulogies in the papers through to angry words on the street and in the
  House of Commons.\u00a0The truth is I am genuinely shaken by it. Like the
  Queen Mother, she was one of those figures we all suspected might go on
  forever, and her shadow was long. With it gone, one of the touchpoints for my
  personal politics is gone.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  I started to think about how I might even begin to parse what has happened:
  I&#8217;m not sad, but I&#8217;ll admit I didn&#8217;t crack open the
  champagne personally; I merely drank someone else&#8217;s.So in a similar
  vein, I wanted to write not about her, but about representations of
  her.<\/p>\n

  <p>
    I&#8217;m going to start with one of my favourite political cartoonists.
    Alongside his later portrayal of her puppeteering Tony Blair, comic
    artist\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.belltoons.co.uk\/books\"
    target=\"_blank\">Steve Bell<\/a>\u00a0also focuses on her controlling
    authority. He wrote a series called
    <strong
      >Maggie&#8217;s Farm<\/strong> which depicted her\u00a0as completely
      insane &#8211; with trademark wonky eye and multiple exclamation points in
      her speech.<\/p>\n
      <p>
        The comics, which reference Dylan&#8217;s song of the same title (which
        was in itself used as a protest song against Thatcher)
        were\u00a0originally published in
        <strong
          >Time Out<\/strong> from 1979, and, to my eye, probably heavily
          influenced later depictions.<\/p>\n

            <p>
              The first time I saw
              <strong
                >Spitting Image<\/strong> I was hooked, probably helped by the
                fact my parents told me I wasn&#8217;t allowed to watch it, and
                to this day I regret that it has gone off the air. Perhaps
                it&#8217;s because no satire is strong enough to be
                distinguished from the ridiculous facts of today&#8217;s
                government? Anyway, back to Thatcher.<\/p>\n
                <p>
                  The depiction of her was grotesque, but no more so than that
                  of any other puppet on the show. That said, it was the
                  <em
                    >nature<\/em> of the grotesque that interested me.<\/p>\n
                    <p>

                      She was ridiculed for her strength and controlling nature
                      in the form of a horrific headmistress. It&#8217;s
                      interesting to note that later John Major was ridiculed
                      for his
                      <em
                        >lack<\/em> of strength.<\/p>\n
                        <p>
                          But rather than this being portrayed as an essential
                          part of her it was represented in reference to
                          Thatcher as a woman \u00a0(note the ongoing references
                          to her as &#8220;sir&#8221;).\u00a0Her strength was
                          ridiculed, in part, by presenting it as
                          &#8220;unfeminine&#8221; and therefore funny or
                          dangerous: a stereotype of women in politics that will
                          no doubt take many years to overturn. <a

                                  whereas the

                                    usually either asexual or very masculine,
                                    here she is quite the opposite. Guns and
                                    victory explosions fire from her breasts as
                                    she squats (in high heels, with rounded
                                    buttocks and suspenders, no less) over her
                                    land and nation in a parody of birth. The
                                    conflation of female and war-machine gives
                                    rise to a gross, highly sexualised
                                    fembot.<\/p>\n

                                        I returned from holiday just over a year
                                        ago to find London distressingly covered
                                        in images of Meryl Streep in
                                        <strong
                                          >The Iron Lady<\/strong>, with her icy
                                          blue eyes following me all over the
                                          place. It haunted me, <a

                                          much the same way as it did our Rhian
                                          Jones<\/a> (I&#8217;ll admit it, I
                                          couldn&#8217;t bring myself to see the
                                          film).<\/p>\n
                                          <p>
                                            It was the glossiness of the whole
                                            thing that threw me, the vogue-ish
                                            fashion magazine stylings that
                                            worked their hardest to reunite
                                            those twin features of
                                            &#8220;female&#8221; and
                                            &#8220;powerful&#8221; which had
                                            created such horrors through both

                                              >Spitting Image<\/strong> and at
                                              the pencil of Raymond Briggs. And
                                              they succeeded in being very
                                              flattering, through a combination
                                              of make-up and airbrushing.<\/p>\n
                                              <p>
                                                Streep is noticeably less
                                                wrinkled and more
                                                attractively-styled than
                                                Thatcher, looking eerily like a
                                                better-looking sister. The
                                                situation was enhanced by
                                                Streep&#8217;s own acting
                                                ability, and a script which
                                                included scenes of feminine
                                                domesticity.<\/p>\n

                                                  I never knew her. Never met

                                                  on the television as a
                                                  politician and in other
                                                  representations of her, which
                                                  are more numerous than I can
                                                  contain in one article.
                                                  Buzzfeed, for example, <a

                                                      To me, she will always be
                                                      the figurehead for all
                                                      that is wrong with right

                                                      doing it. Those with
                                                      opposing politics have put
                                                      her on a pedestal. Other
                                                      people will make her into
