    <strong
      >Ah! Forget My Fate Part II<\/strong> consists of an ambitious three-woman
      staging of Purcell&#8217;s most famous opera, Dido and Aeneas. A courtly
      drama with a twist, the production asks: how can the most powerful woman
      in Carthage survive when her worst enemies lie
      within?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n

                  ><br \ />\nWhy would a feminist opera company put on Dido and
                  Aeneas?<br \ />\n<\/strong><br \ />\n&#8220;Because in many
                  ways,
                  <strong
                    >Dido and Aeneas<\/strong> is where it all started. Whether
                    or not

                      classical tradition is up for (interminable and pedantic)
                      debate, but it&#8217;s certainly one of the earliest
                      that&#8217;s regularly performed \u2013 particularly here
                      in the UK where we&#8217;re based. And Dido is the first
                      in a noble tradition of heroines who die an arguably
                      completely pointless death (in the context of the opera as
                      a self-contained work, anyway), so to me it makes sense
                      for us to begin at the beginning.<\/p>\n
                      <p>
                        &#8220;It was also written, we think, to be performed by
                        a girls&#8217; school, which makes it well suited for
                        modern adaptations with exclusively female
                        voices.<\/p>\n

                      <p>
                        &#8220;A personal motivation for me is that <a

                          kind of conquest (sexual, emotional or literal) from
                          the men around her, and she earned the respect of her
                          people through an ironclad adherence to an
                          ideal.&#8221;<\/p>\n

                                &#8220;As a producer\/director, the main
                                question I want to ask of the work is why Dido
                                dies. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s ultimately led
                                me personally to the staging we&#8217;re about
                                to present here. I don&#8217;t believe that
                                people die of a broken heart, unless they have
                                some kind of congenital heart defect, and I
                                don&#8217;t believe that the queen of Carthage
                                has the kind of emotional pallor that lends
                                itself to dying of a hissy fit after the bloke
                                you&#8217;ve known for a couple of days decides
                                it&#8217;s time to move on. I want there to be a
                                driving force behind it. I want to know what it
                                is about the witches that gives them such power
                                over Dido.<\/p>\n
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                &#8220;People who aren&#8217;t familiar with
                                classical mythology, and the Aeneid in
                                particular, aren&#8217;t all that likely to know
                                much about Dido, and you&#8217;re certainly not
                                going to learn anything about her from the text
                                of Purcell&#8217;s opera. Our telling of the
                                story \u2013 the recasting of the witches as the
                                shadow selves of the named characters \u2013 is
                                intended to help to fill in the blanks. Nahum
                                Tate (librettist)&#8217;s Dido is not
                                controlling, masochistic, or even particularly
                                bold, and that is why Dido&#8217;s shadow self
                                \u2013 and, by extension, the witches \u2013
                                have so much power. The impulse is there, and is
                                all the more irresistible for going
                                unrecognised.<\/p>\n
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                &#8220;I want to retell Dido and Aeneas because
                                I love Dido and I can&#8217;t stand Aeneas. If
                                you take Tate&#8217;s text by itself,
                                she&#8217;s nothing but a puppet at his mercy,
                                and I don&#8217;t want that for her. I want her
                                to have agency, even if it&#8217;s an agency
                                that no-one can quite understand. And I want him
                                to look like a tool, because he
                                is.&#8221;<\/p>\n

                                    &#8220;Basically, I would like to transmit
                                    the idea that Dido&#8217;s story runs deeper
                                    than the text of the opera implies. I think
                                    we&#8217;re helping the audience along there
                                    with the addition of newspapers, which help
                                    to flesh out what might be going on beyond
                                    the confines of Dido&#8217;s palace and what
                                    kind of impact her dalliances might be
                                    having outside. In the mythology, Dido is a
                                    really great ruler who is essentially
                                    completely derailed by Aeneas&#8217; arrival
                                    on the scene. I want the audience to get a
                                    sense of that.<\/p>\n

                                            &#8220;I want to teach people to

                                            singing. That would be a unifying

                                            &#8220;Back when I was doing GCSEs,
                                            <strong
                                              >Dido&#8217;s Lament<\/strong>
                                              came up as a regularly used
                                              example of how melody + basso
                                              continuo worked, so I think it
                                              could be a great set of lessons to
                                              people aged 13+ of how
                                              Purcell&#8217;s music was
                                              constructed and how his melodies,
                                              instrumentation and word-setting
                                              were put together. I think it
                                              would be more fun and probably
                                              more instructive for people to do
                                              this\/see it done in
                                              performance.<\/p>\n

                                                to use it as an opportunity to
                                                teach story-makers of the future
