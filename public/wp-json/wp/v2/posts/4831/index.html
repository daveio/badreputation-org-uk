              Like Sarah, I felt I was the target audience. I&#8217;m a
              pubescent boy who likes ladies, dragons, guns and stuff going on
              fire. There was no ingredient that went into this that, in theory,
              I wouldn&#8217;t like. But I hated it. I was blisteringly

                The person this film was made for is a person that fetishises

                  That&#8217;s a harsh paragraph. I realise that. But it really
                  is the only way I can describe this film. It&#8217;s
                  chock-full of abuse (implied rape and explicit beating) and
                  the way it&#8217;s handled is emphatically not empowering in
                  any way. The film is ostensibly about women battling their
                  inner demons (quite literally, in this case &#8211; I see what
                  you did there, Mr Snyder) and surviving, but it fails at every
                  possible hurdle. The only way the characters can be powerful
                  and dangerous is if they&#8217;re laminated in glitter,
                  leather and fishnet. And the only way they can survive their
                  abuse is if they cry and scream on screen and track mascara
                  down their faces. Fear is sexy, you see.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  I can&#8217;t put it better than if I just quote what one of
                  the characters says (not verbatim, but it ran along these
                  lines): &#8220;They act it all out up there [on a stage].
                  It&#8217;s quite a show, you know, when they&#8217;re acting
                  out who touched them or hurt them or whatever.&#8221;<\/p>\n
                </p>

                    make the film self-aware and clever &#8211; he does it quite
                    a lot, like the bit where we traipse right into Baby
                    Doll&#8217;s inner world and there&#8217;s this line (again,
                    paraphrasing, but Zack himself paraphrases similarly in the
                    interview linked at the start of this post):<\/p>\n

                              constantly dresses like she&#8217;s 13) is all in
                              the name of ironic, clever, snappy feminism.
                              It&#8217;s a lancing, sassy criticism of
                              objectification, you say.<\/p>\n
                              <p>
                                Well, let me tell you something, Zack. There is
                                nothing sexy, sassy or ironic about rape. There
                                is nothing clever, witty, edgy or cool about
                                showing us terrified, crying girls dressed like
                                they&#8217;re 13 years old, getting abused in a
                                way that is clearly meant to be titillating. It
                                was about half-way in, and there was another
                                scene of a weeping, shaking girl being hit in
                                the face by a man who &#8211; it was strongly
                                implied &#8211; at least attempted to rape her,
                                when I realised that I just didn&#8217;t care
                                what clever, witty, ironic message Zack Snyder
                                was trying to send. The fact of the matter was
                                that I was being fed images that anyone with
                                even a hint of abuse in their past would find
                                nauseatingly upsetting to watch and I was meant
                                to be sitting there, revelling in how darkly
                                sexy it all was, and going, &#8220;Hmm, yes,
                                well done Mr Snyder, this is certainly a very

                                    I could now continue to comment further on
                                    the film and how the characters were
                                    distinguishable only by outfit and hair, and
                                    how stating facts about characters
                                    doesn&#8217;t make us care for them
                                    automatically. I could say that the only
                                    bits that I loved in the film were the bits
                                    with the airships and the dragons. I could
                                    say that the only character that I
                                    empathised with was the Mother Dragon. But
                                    Sarah&#8217;s covered that and I agree with
                                    her, so what I&#8217;m going to say instead

                                        I love it because the characters in it
                                        work as a tightly-wound, perfect

                                          But it wasn&#8217;t based on something
                                          that Snyder originally wrote. And,
                                          most crucially importantly, the
                                          objectified, sexualised Spartan
                                          warriors and their acres of bronzed
                                          musculature are not abused. They
                                          struggle, fight, love and die for each
                                          other in a war, but they&#8217;re not
                                          smacked in the face and threatened
                                          with rape every fifteen minutes. When
                                          they fight as an army, the camera
                                          caresses their strength, their
                                          competence and their teamwork

                                                too. In fact, one of the major
                                                themes in the film is that the
                                                only power these women have is
                                                their sexual desirability.
