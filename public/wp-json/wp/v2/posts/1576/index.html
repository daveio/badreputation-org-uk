  Oh, BadRep.\u00a0 How I wish I didn&#8217;t have to write the article
  I&#8217;m writing now.\u00a0 How I wish that everything we fall in love with
  in the entertainment industry was miles and miles from feministic
  reproach.\u00a0 How I wish that something, somewhere would just do everything
  <em
    >right<\/em> and not suck in sudden and unexpected ways.<\/p>\n
    <p>
      Today, I&#8217;m subverting my own trope and writing about a game.\u00a0 I
      do love a good computer game.\u00a0 I like ones with excellent, flawed
      characters, and even more excellent, bizarre plots.\u00a0 I like them big
      and sweeping and mind-bending, ideally with some kind of stealth element
      and something freaky and supernatural in the mix.\u00a0 So naturally, I
      love the
      <strong
        >Assassin&#8217;s Creed<\/strong> franchise.\u00a0 Dear god do I love
        the
        <strong
          >Assassin&#8217;s Creed<\/strong> franchise.<\/p>\n
          <p>
            &#8220;Love&#8221; is probably not the right word.\u00a0 It&#8217;s
            not enough to convey the level of brain-melting, nose-bleed-inducing
            obsession I have with it.\u00a0 It doesn&#8217;t illustrate the way
            I dissolve into a twitching heap when exposed to the soundtrack, or
            that I screamed at the ending of the first game and spent the next
            week &#8211; avoiding spoilers &#8211; sleeplessly deciphering it
            with the aid of the internet.\u00a0 &#8220;Love&#8221; just
            doesn&#8217;t cover it.\u00a0 My affection for it is worrying.\u00a0
            It feeds my soul with the purest, shimmering godlike joy from on
            high through a<em>
              glee tube<\/em>.<\/p>\n
              <p>
                So please understand how hard it is for me to criticise it in
                any way.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                The franchise is, as the title may suggest, about Assassins with
                a capital A: not hitmen-for-hire, but the original Hashshashin,
                a devoted army of politically-motivated killers locked in a
                battle against the Knights Templar in an exciting tangle of
                conspiracy theory fodder that gets increasingly bizarre as the
                series continues.\u00a0 Most of the characters are male.\u00a0
                This is partially a reflection on the time period in question
                (mid-Crusades era Syria and the Italian Renaissance) but also
                because, according to trope,
                <em
                  >there is only one type of female assassin<\/em>.<\/p>\n
                  <p>
                    &#8220;What type is that?&#8221; I hear you cry, perplexed
                    that there should be more than one type of Assassin at
                    all.<\/p>\n
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You already know.\u00a0 It&#8217;s the Sex Assassin.\u00a0
                    The one that lures in the victim with sexual desire, and
                    then! when they&#8217;re at their most vulnerable!
                    <em
                      >murders them with stabbing<\/em>.<\/p>\n
                      <p>
                        This trope is old.\u00a0 The Sex Assassin is inevitably
                        female.\u00a0 She&#8217;s the Battle Whore; a sexually
                        desirable object of cunning, guise and stabbing, and
                        it&#8217;s exciting because there she is!
                        \u00a0Subverting regular heterosexual intercourse by
                        penetrating the man she&#8217;s seduced!\u00a0
                        <em
                          >With a knife.<\/em> Do you see what they did
                          there!\u00a0 Surely we are all undone with the
                          inventiveness.\u00a0 Women being all deadly and
                          effective!\u00a0 But only if couched in the narrative
                          device of being used as a sex object.\u00a0 That is
                          the only way they can be empowered, apparently.<\/p>\n
                          <p>
                            I desperately hoped that my beloved
                            <strong
                              >Assassin&#8217;s Creed<\/strong> would break free
                              of this trope and give us some hard-ass, female
                              battle bastards, but it doesn&#8217;t,
                              really.\u00a0 I looked at the line-up of playable
                              classes for the most recent massive release,
                              <strong
                                >Assassin&#8217;s Creed: Brotherhood<\/strong>,
                                and there&#8217;s an array of interesting
                                traditionally male roles: you&#8217;ve got a
                                <span style=\"text-decoration:
                                line-through;\">tank<\/span> hangman, a plague
                                doctor and a priest&#8230; and then
                                there&#8217;s the woman.\u00a0 There she is, at
                                the back.\u00a0 You can tell that she&#8217;s
                                The Woman because there&#8217;s an awful lot of
                                cleavage going on.<\/p>\n<div

                                      unlike all the other people in the world,
                                      who are apparently all hard, breastless,
                                      cisgendered men.\u00a0 Women and their
                                      breasts are magical and rare, much like
                                      unicorns.\u00a0 So naturally, she&#8217;ll

                                      that.\u00a0 Because they don&#8217;t have
