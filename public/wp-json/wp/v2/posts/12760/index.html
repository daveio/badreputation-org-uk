                                          delivery is presented as particularly
                                          sanguinary; a festival of blood and
                                          sweat. It\u2019s a burlesque of the
                                          natural; a grotesque, pantomimic
                                          affair attended entirely by a gorily
                                          deceased medical staff provided by the
                                          house.<\/p>\n

                                        <p>
                                          With neither the clinical intervention
                                          of the modern birthing experience nor
                                          the cleanliness of the body innocent,
                                          the birth plays on both classically
                                          Freudian and modern germophobic fears.
                                          It is, from both perspectives,
                                          unclean.<\/p>\n

                                          The point of Horror, if there must be
                                          one, is to walk the line between
                                          desirable and undesirable; to cross or
                                          threaten the boundaries that separate
                                          stability and chaos. Childbirth, as a
                                          triumph of the primal over the
                                          civilised and the inner over the
                                          outer, is a natural exemplar of this.
                                          It\u2019s naturally yukky and
                                          generally unstoppable, and that makes
                                          it pretty frightening. Here we\u2019re

                                          claustrophobic urgency of the scene,
                                          and heavy blood-loss.<\/p>\n

                                                sexual organs begin to resemble
                                                a wound. The imagery is graphic,
