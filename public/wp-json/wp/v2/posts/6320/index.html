<p>
  Let&#8217;s be clear here, I love<strong>
    Caitlin Moran<\/strong>. Her <a
    href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/caitlinmoran\">tweets<\/a> make me laugh until
    milk comes out of my nose, often at times when I have not drunk milk. That
    is how magic she is. So once I found out she had written a book on feminism
    I almost broke land speed records on the way to the bookshop. <a

      Which is high praise as these days, as I usually balk at the price of
      books when they can be gotten for free from your local library &#8211; and
      indeed should be for the most part, because otherwise those fools in power
      will try to close them.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Torygeddon aside, I&#8217;ve recently been really happy with the
      &#8220;new&#8221; (over the past ten or so years; they aren&#8217;t
      appearing like the rash of teenage vampire novels) books about feminism
      &#8211; like <a
      href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/books\/2010\/jan\/31\/living-dolls-natasha-walter\"><strong
        >Living Dolls<\/strong> by Natasha Walter<\/a>. Angry books, clever
        books, often books by young women. But at the same time I did get a
        little turned off by them &#8211; they were also difficult books,
        thoughful, smart books that needed full your full attention and dealt
        with very big, very important feminist issues in very serious ways.
        After which you tend to feel sad, or angry and a bit frustrated.<\/p>\n
        <p>
          Whilst there is certainly room and need for those books, there&#8217;s
          also a need for this book. Because this isn&#8217;t about the big
          stuff, not entirely. It&#8217;s about one woman and her journey
          through a very personal feminism. It&#8217;s about pants being
          annoyingly too small, fashion, eating too much cheese, having a crap
          dog, rowing with your family and the general business of living.
          It&#8217;s pop-feminism, and we at BadRep are all behind that &#8211;
          the kind of feminism that is easy to access, relevant and
          doesn&#8217;t require you to have digested a thesaurus or the entire
          works of <a
          href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Helene_Cixous\">Helene
          Cixous<\/a> in the original french. It&#8217;s a &#8220;normal&#8221;
          book, and normalising feminism is something I am all for. It does
          cover some &#8220;serious feminist&#8221; topics &#8211; such as
          abortion (covered in more detail in a review by <a
          href=\"http:\/\/www.abortionrights.org.uk\/index.php\/media-and-resource-centre\/news\/257\">Abortion
          Rights over here<\/a>), having children, not having children,
          prostitution, rape, sexism in all its many forms. But you never feel
          preached at, or patronised.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          So, what&#8217;s it like to read? Well, it&#8217;s a bit like being in
          the pub with our Editor, Miranda, when she&#8217;s had a couple of
          ciders and is &#8220;holding forth&#8221;. Certainly as far as goes
          the excessive use of CAPS LOCK AND EXCLAMATION POINTS TO MAKE THINGS
          STAND OUT!!!<sup
            ><a href=\"#footnote_0_6320\" id=\"identifier_0_6320\"
            class=\"footnote-link footnote-identifier-link\" title=\" &ldquo;Oh
            GOD, guilty as charged&rdquo; &ndash; Ed \">1<\/a><\/sup> To call it
            &#8220;friendly and personal&#8221; sounds a bit pat and cliched,
            but it is. The book takes the form of an autobiography of growing up
            &#8211; poor and in Wolverhampton &#8211; and dealing with the
            challenges of becoming a woman. It&#8217;s deeply refreshing to find
            some non-university educated, working class feminism. Feminism that
            doesn&#8217;t rely heavily on theory. Feminism that makes me laugh,
            and read sections out to my flatmate so we can both spew milk from
            our noses. It&#8217;s a book that&#8217;s easy and fun (yes,
            feminism can be fun!) to read, and I devoured it in a few
            hours.<\/p>\n
            <p>
              I recommend it, naturally. But I also offer a few caveats. There
              were a couple of points that I didn&#8217;t like, and they came
              from the same place as the stuff I did like. You see, when you
              write informally, personally and from the heart, you also tend to
              be a bit less careful than you might with word use. And sloppy
              language is very perilous when you are criticising sexism, which
              is also about sloppy language, in part. The word
              &#8220;retarded&#8221; for example, is used a couple of times, to
              describe being like someone with a learning disability. This is
              not cool. It&#8217;s a word that we should all stop using (much
              like &#8220;n*gger&#8221;). There is no reclaiming this word. End
              of.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              I also found myself getting a bit twitchy with some of her
              assumptions &#8211; and again, these were down to the personal,
              anecdotal approach. Her feminism is not exactly my feminism. I do
              not believe, for example, that women are quite so biologically
              constrained that cystitis is the reason we didn&#8217;t found
              empires. I found the focus in on the experience of living in a
              cisgender woman&#8217;s body and the assumption of
              &#8220;natural&#8221; consequences to this a bit disarming. But
              then, my teenage years were not hers. My growing pains were
              different.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              It is a brave book. It doesn&#8217;t pull any punches, and there
              will be bits that you disagree with. But that&#8217;s part of the
              point of polemics; they stand their ground, pitbull-like, and
              assert a view. The ensuing debate carries them forward. And the
              jokes. Still cleaning milk off my t-shirt over the high-heeled
              shoe bit.<\/p>\n<ol class=\"footnotes\"><li id=\"footnote_0_6320\"
