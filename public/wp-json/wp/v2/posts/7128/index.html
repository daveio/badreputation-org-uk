  Today\u2019s hero had some really quite impressive career advancement over the
  course of her life. Starting as a small time actress (and most likely
  prostitute &#8211; the entertainment industry of the time was apparently
  incredibly sleazy), she moved on to wool spinning, a job path she took to its
  logical conclusion as\u2026 Empress? Oh, and then Saint. Who makes a career
  move like that? The

        time of Theodora only the Blues and Greens were particularly
        influential. \">1<\/a><\/sup>. Following her father\u2019s death she was
        presented to the Blue faction and became a supporter of theirs. Being a
        supporter of the Blue faction would prove to be significant later in her
        life.<\/p>\n
        <p>
          The details of her time as an actress or prostitute are somewhat
          unclear, with a lack of reliable resources on the topic. <a

          spends a lot of his

            href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/John_of_Ephesus\">John of
            Ephesus<\/a> calls her \u201cTheodora ek tou porneiou\u201d, or
            \u201cTheodora from the brothel.\u201d Historian Lynda Garland,
            however, argues that there\u2019s little reason to believe Theodora
            worked in what we\u2019d recognise as a modern brothel. Instead, she
            claimed, it was more like a stage-house in which the acting involved
            lewd displays and off-stage sexual activities with clients were
            standard. Either way, it was definitely a low status job.<br

            <p>
              Around about 516 AD, Theodora leaves the theatre\/brothel and
              travels to North Africa. By the time she returns to Constantinople
              four years later she\u2019ll have made the acquaintance of several
              high ranking officials throughout the Empire, converted to <a
              href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Monophysitism\">Monophysite
              Christianity<\/a>, and decided to take up a career as a wool
              spinner. Well, possibly. It\u2019s also possible that the
              &#8216;wool spinning&#8217; was a detail added to her life by
              writers in the 11th century. It was seen as a more virtuous
              career, one that would partially forgive the &#8216;sins&#8217; of
              her earlier life, and thus may have been fabricated to give her
              respectability.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              Whether she was a wool spinner or not, it was around the time of
              her return to Constantinople that she became associated with the
              young Justinian, the adopted heir of Justin I. It\u2019s unclear
              quite how they met, but quite likely it was through a dancer,
              Macedonia, a member of the Blue faction and informer to Justinian
              who was himself a Blue faction supporter. <\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              Marriage between Theodora and Justinian was initially problematic.
              Byzantine laws prevented the heir from marrying an actress, and
              Emperor Justin\u2019s wife Euphemia would not grant Justinian
              permission to pursue this. Following her death however the
              Emperor, being fond of both Justinian and Theodora, changed the
              law, allowing an actress to repent her past and be considered a
              clean slate of virtue. Thus the pair were married, and in 527
              ascended to the position of Emperor and Empress.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              Of course, just becoming the Empress of the Byzantine Empire,
              though undeniably one hell of an achievement, does not
              automatically make a person awesome. Theodora gets awesome because
              of what she did while she was in power. For one thing, she was by
              all accounts Justinian\u2019s intellectual equal, taking a hand in
              the forming of Byzantine policy. They may have gotten together
              because of basic lust, but a sharp mind kept her respected and on
              the throne (despite being a follower of the Monophysite
              heresy).<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              The Blue and Green factions mentioned earlier? About five years
              into the reign of Justinian and Theodora, they caused trouble in
              something halfway between a political uprising and a football riot
              (though with chariot racing instead of football). An event known
              as the <a
              href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nika_riots\">Nika
              Riots<\/a> (which is one of history\u2019s most fascinating
              incidents) saw half of Constantinople burned to the ground, and
              thousands killed. Justinian and his officials were on the brink of
              abandoning the city and fleeing for safety when Theodora, so the
              sources claim, made a stand. <\/p>\n
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                Those who have worn the crown should never survive its loss.
                Never will I see the day when I am not saluted as empress.
                Royalty makes a fine burial shroud. <\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                &#8211; Attributed to Empress Theodora\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                Spurred into action by Theodora, Justinian rallied his forces,
                the riots were put down, and order restored. Over the following
                years Theodora and Justinian would engage in a large scale
                public works programme to rebuild the city, including rebuilding
                the <a
                href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hagia_Sophia\">Hagia
                Sophia<\/a> in its current form as one of the architectural
                wonders of the world.<br \ />\nWhen not putting down rebellions,
                Theodora was instrumental in passing laws aimed at increasing
                the rights of many women in the Byzantine Empire. This included
                the institution of the death penalty for rape, the increasing of
                property rights and the rights to guardianship of children, and
                the closing of brothels followed by the opening of a convent to
                support former sex workers. <\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                Theodora died of unknown causes in 548 AD. Afterwards Emperor
                Justinian worked to keep the peace and protect her small
                community of Monophysites, despite being a <a
                href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Chalcedonian_Christianity\">Chalcedonian
                Christian<\/a> himself. Both of them were eventually canonised
                by the Eastern Orthodox Church.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                So there\u2019s Theodora. Given to a sports team as a child,
                grew up in the sleazy Byzantine entertainment industry, ended up
                one of the most powerful women in the world and eventually a
                saint. How\u2019s that for an achievement?<\/p>\n
