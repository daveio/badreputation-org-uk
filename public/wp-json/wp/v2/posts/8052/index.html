    <h3>
      Pr0n<\/h3>\n
      <p>
        I&#8217;ll get my position down as briefly as I can here so I can get on
        with the post. I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m &#8216;pro-porn&#8217;
        because I&#8217;m dead against the unsafe and exploitative (like many
        industries, it must be said) mainstream porn industry. I find a lot of
        it distressing and unpleasant to watch. But I don&#8217;t accept the
        argument that violent porn has any causal link to violence against women
        beyond the fact that it re-inscribes the values already at large in our
        society. Symptom not cause, I\u2018d say.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        I have no problem with porn in theory. But mainstream heterosexual porn
        and all its cliches has become so dominant and so widely accepted that
        it has become the &#8216;norm&#8217; against which the bodies, fantasies
        and sexual experiences of real people are judged. We need positive,
        progressive sex education and much greater diversity, acceptance and
        openness about sex and representations of sex.<\/p>\n

          Anyway. Here&#8217;s a brief synopsis I pinched from this <a

        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Celluloid is the story of a woman who, during a moment of sexual
            frustration, discovers a film projector and reel of film that
            depicts a couple having sex\u2026 this woman finds herself traveling
            from our world into a dreamlike realm of sexual fantasies
            that&#8217;s presented in the artist&#8217;s trademarked
            style(s)&#8230;. The woman begins simply as a voyeur and eventually
            graduates to full participant in various activities with the
            entities she encounters.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n

            slideshow<\/a> of images from the book so you can see what
            they\u2019re talking about. It\u2019s terribly beautiful, which to
            be honest I have come to expect from McKean. But the whole thing
            left me with a sadly unsexy feeling of \u2018meh\u2019.<\/p>\n

          <h3>
            Tickle my Intellect<\/h3>\n
            <p>
              Of course, reviewing an erotic work is tricky because what flicks
              your switches is such a personal matter, but even setting that
              aside I found I was disappointed. It didn\u2019t turn me on. But
              it didn\u2019t interest me either. In this <a
              href=\"http:\/\/www.comicbookresources.com\/?page=article&amp;id=32469\">Comic
              Book Resources interview<\/a>, McKean outlines some of his aims
              behind the project:<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                Most pornography is pretty awful. I mean, it does the job at the
                most utilitarian level, but it rarely excites other areas of the
                mind, or the eye. It&#8217;s repetitive, bland and often a bit
                silly. I was interested in trying to do something that\u2026
                tickles the intellect as well as the more basic areas of the
                mind.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                Yay for intellect-tickling! That sounds right up my street. But
                I don\u2019t think
                <strong
                  >Celluloid<\/strong> delivered. I realise now that what I was
                  hoping for was something that felt as different to mainstream
                  porn as <a title=\"Black Orchid\"
                  href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/2011\/05\/24\/black-orchid-ecofeminism-and-the-feminine-superheroic\/\"><strong
                    >Black Orchid<\/strong><\/a> was from most 1980s superhero
                    comics. And of course it
                    <em
                      >is<\/em> different on its shimmering surface, but the
                      fantastic situations and sensual artwork are resting on
                      some conventions from mainstream pornography that hold no
                      allure for me.<\/p>\n
                      <p>
                        For example: the female protagonist is inevitably thin,
                        white, and able-bodied, with long blonde hair.
                        She&#8217;s apparently bi-curious heterosexual. After
                        having a bath in her empty house, she decides to put her
                        high heels back on. The situation that frames her sexual
                        journey is that she comes home and calls her
                        boyfriend\/husband\/playmate, but he\u2019s still at the
                        office, so she\u2019s stuck with a pout, a bath and some
                        self-pleasure. I was half expecting her to order a pizza
                        and get it on with the delivery man. One reviewer, who I
                        won\u2019t grace with a link, even described her as a
                        \u2018bored housewife\u2019.\u00a0It just feels so
                        clich\u00e9d, and for me that undermines the eroticism
                        of the art and the originality of the project.<\/p>\n

                          I\u2019m going to call the Boobfruit section, in which

                            conveniently dropped into a painting of a youthful

                                But although the story \u2018stars\u2019 a
                                woman, it\u2019s not really told from her
                                perspective. I mean, you follow her on her
                                surrealist sex adventures, but at no point do
                                you get any real idea of her feelings or
                                thoughts. She is stereotypically passive; she
                                wanders into situations and things happen to
                                her, and she embraces them, but doesn\u2019t act
                                or take the initiative.<\/p>\n

                                Although the woman begins as an observer and
                                becomes a participant, it\u2019s just a trade of
                                one kind of objecthood for another, we have no
                                sense of her interior life, to the extent that I
                                find it a bit creepy. She is even drawn in a
                                remarkably dead-eyed, expressionless way.<\/p>\n

                                I still admire Dave McKean as an artist and
                                illustrator, and I don&#8217;t intend this
                                review as an attack on him; he seems like a
                                thoroughly nice bloke. I understand that he
                                didn\u2019t produce

                                  target audience, and perhaps he never intended
                                  to challenge all (or any) of the conventions
                                  of mainstream porn. But I wish he had, since
                                  for me that would have turned a mildly
                                  interesting and attractive book into something
