<p>
  I\u2019ve had a few people ask me about one of the presents I mentioned in my
  suggestions for <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/2010\/12\/21\/team-badrep-do-christmas\/\">Team
  BadRep&#8217;s Christmas list<\/a>: the cartoon series
  <strong
    ><a
    href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender\">Avatar
    \u2013 the last Airbender<\/a><\/strong>. Unlike some of the gift
    suggestions it\u2019s not a specifically feminist item, but I recommended it
    because I think it\u2019s awesome on many levels and feminist-friendly as
    well. (Some spoilers ahead!)<\/p>\n
    <p>
      First of all, there\u2019s a rough gender balance. The core group is made
      up of two boys and two girls. They are as important as each other on
      average &#8211; one of the boys is the title character, but the other is
      something of a clown figure who doesn\u2019t have any of the powers that
      the two girls do. It\u2019s not that clear-cut because everyone has a lot
      of growth over the series, but there is no \u201c<em
        >male hero and some sidekicks<\/em>\u201d dynamic going on here. They
        are all important, and talented in different ways.<\/p>\n
        <p>
          The enemies are initially men (especially a teenage boy and his
          grandfather), but his sister and her female friends take even more of
          the villain roles later on (and are frankly better at them). When the
          core group gains another man, a woman who was previously a side
          character gets more screentime too.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          What\u2019s more interesting to me than strict number balance is that
          the roles for women are
          <em
            >very, very good<\/em>. The show is set in a fantasy world in which
            combat is a critical part of cultural identity and power, but if
            anything the women are more precise and technically proficient at
            fighting than the men. There is even an early scene where a
            blustering male fighter spars with an expert female warrior,
            assuming he\u2019ll have to go easy on her, and she deliberately and
            calmly takes him apart. In the \u2018enemy\u2019 family, the sister
            has a greater knowledge and tighter focus of their family\u2019s
            technique than anyone else.<\/p>\n
            <p>
              Another thing it does well is to show real martial arts, and how
              women can be just as effective at them without falling into the
              typical trap of only being given the soft and gentle styles. In
              this story the arts are learned by tribe, and if either men or
              women show talent then they can perform them. So the main young
              woman in the group does Tai Chi (thought of as soft by anyone who
              hasn\u2019t had to go up against it, seriously, bloody hell) but
              all the men of her tribe do too. In fact, she encounters prejudice
              from a teacher who won\u2019t train her because he doesn\u2019t
              see it as a woman\u2019s role \u2013 so the show certainly
              didn\u2019t assign her the style because it sees it as soft and
              feminine.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              The other girl in the main group (and I mean girl, I don\u2019t
              think she\u2019s a teen yet?) knows the style which is the
              heaviest and most unmovable, based on rock. When you have a mixed
              group like this the female roles often just happen to result in
              \u201cInvisible Woman with passive\/protective powers\u201d.
              Healer girlfriend, in other words. Not here &#8211; these female
              characters are determined, immensely capable in attack, and in
              some cases the most ruthless people in the show. The camera
              doesn\u2019t cut away from the effects of their rage or violence
              either, as we\u2019ve seen a trend recently where women
              aren\u2019t shown equally during violent scenes. The fighting is
              an extension of their character, even their soul, so is shown in
              great detail because it is relevant and part of the
              storytelling.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              The series is also very good on race. The \u201cTribes\u201d are
              roughly based on Asian countries, with Japan, China and Tibet
              being obviously represented. The Water Tribe live at the poles (on
              the ice), and are darker skinned than everyone else. This is never
              once commented on: they are the Water tribe, of course
              they\u2019re the colour they are. While there\u2019s plenty of
              tension between the groups, there\u2019s absolutely no racial
              hatred. Characters acknowledge that one of the tribes is being
              warlike right now, but they know that all four make up the world
              and never treat anyone as lesser based on skin colour. Those
              planning the long-term subjugation of other tribes are shown to be
              dangerously out of control and out of balance.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              (This became a sore point when M Night Shyamalan made a Hollywood
              movie of the series and <a
              href=\"http:\/\/cdn-www.cracked.com\/articleimages\/ob\/avatar_the_last_airbender_r.jpg?w=408&amp;h=440\">cast
              predominantly white actors as the all-Asian characters.<\/a> And a
              British-Indian actor as the baddie, who ironically is the palest
              person in the cartoon series).<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              Most of all I recommend
              <strong
                >Avatar: The Last Airbender<\/strong> to everyone because
                it\u2019s just so full of joy. The comedy is genuinely funny and
                never gets old; the sentiments are exactly what I want kids to
                be learning from TV. The characters are deep, flawed, and have
                development arcs, the women are not sidelined even though the
                cultural and fantasy setting could have made that easy and even
                likely. It celebrates establishing yourself but doesn\u2019t
                glorify violence. It\u2019s just superb, frequently beautiful
                and very admirable.<\/p>\n
                <p>
                  I\u2019ve seen quite a lot of the anime series and movies
                  which are popular in the West. I\u2019d put this up as one of
                  the best children&#8217;s shows I\u2019ve seen in any format,
                  an anime which holds its own alongside more famous adult fare
                  such as
                  <strong
                    >Akira<\/strong>,
                    <strong
                      >Ghost in the Shell<\/strong> and
                      <strong
                        >Neon Genesis Evangelion<\/strong> etc.<\/p>\n
                        <p>
                          It\u2019s critical that we teach equality to our
                          children from an early age and TV is still the best
                          medium to reach the most people. I think this is a
                          series you can choose without hesitation. Look for it
                          in the post-Christmas sales!<\/p>\n
