<p>
  I&#8217;ve been thinking about the Bechdel Test recently, and it&#8217;s
  something which has come up frequently in the comments on this site. For those
  who don\u2019t know, this is a test which rates a movie by whether it
  has:<\/p>\n
</p>
<ul>
  \n
  <li>At least two women in it<\/li>\n</li>
  <li>Who talk to each other<\/li>\n</li>
  <li>
    About something other than a man<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n
    <p>
      Now let\u2019s face it, this shouldn\u2019t be difficult. It actually
      doesn\u2019t go very far &#8211; it&#8217;s entirely possible to write a
      movie which passes but is in no way &#8220;feminist&#8221;, or is even
      actively misogynist. It&#8217;s very important not to overestimate
      Bechdel. It tells you nothing about the tone, content or values of a
      film.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      But it does prove that there are two women, and they talk about something
      other than men. That has value, in an industry where the pass rate for
      movies is truly pathetic.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the reasons for this low pass rate are actually more about lazy
      narrative structure than lazy sexism. Far too often if a conversation
      between two women happens, it still fails because it is only about the
      lead character, who is a man. In order to maximise tension and pace, all
      small talk not relating to explosions or imminent danger is cut from the
      script. (Sadly it\u2019s more often replaced with \u201cI hope hero-man X
      can save us!\u201d. Even today, it\u2019s ridiculous how much this
      happens.)<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Network TV suffers from this more than cinema because in most television
      the lead character MUST, MUST be a white male. Must. No negotiation. Must.
      If you deviate from this, you are
      <em
        >That Brave Show with the Alternative Lead<\/em>, and some other stuff
        that no-one pays as much attention to as the fact you have an
        Alternative Lead. Some movies are pushing the boundaries, but the US
        networks generally refuse to.<\/p>\n
        <p>
          So I\u2019m going to talk briefly about TV shows instead of the usual
          movies. TV science-fiction is a genre which usually scores
          pathetically badly in particular, so let\u2019s take a series from
          there which Does It Right:<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong
            >Fringe. <\/strong>(Minor spoilers to follow!)<\/p>\n
            <p>
              Olivia Dunham, a female FBI agent, investigates paranormal events
              with the aid of a genius, his insane father, another female FBI
              agent and occasionally some very recognisable beloved genre
              actors.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              Even here there are problems. The biggest one is that she\u2019s
              arguably not the main character anymore: the show provided such a
              rich story for the insane father (and to be fair, an absolutely
              astonishing actor) that he&#8217;s nearer the centre of the
              show.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              But it certainly does pass the Bechdel test. Olivia frequently
              speaks to her female colleague, her sister and various others on
              work and personal matters. Although she\u2019s quite unemotional
              about many things (due to trust issues and a twisted childhood), a
              lot of the screen time is on her experience as a woman in her
              role. The character is sympathetic and far from
              two-dimensional.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              Much more impressive (and one point which really raised the
              series) is the episode where she is kidnapped and the male leads
              are racing to save her from several armed thugs.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              But they don\u2019t need to, because
              <em
                >she\u2019s an FBI agent<\/em> &#8211; she promptly frees
                herself and beats the living crap out of everyone nearby,
                escapes and phones it in. Because female agents are armed and
                trained professionals, not princesses in a tower.<\/p>\n
                <p>
                  True, it\u2019s another case of a woman excelling by acting in
                  ways traditionally associated with male aggression. Proving
                  they can punch people in the face as hard as men can is NOT
                  the same as depicting realistic female lives on TV. Similarly
                  in politics, being more aggressive, intolerant and eager for
                  war than the male Hawks isn\u2019t the way to be an
                  inspiration for women &#8211; it just means there\u2019s
                  another right-wing patriarchal asshole in the room, and the
                  world has enough of those. But in this case, Dunham\u2019s
                  principles are so strong and her courage so constant that the
                  show is very clearly about her being a competent agent and a
                  woman in the FBI&#8230; without her gender ever marking her
                  out as special. She isn&#8217;t cut any slack by her bosses,
                  and isn&#8217;t expected to react differently under pressure.
                  Olivia naturally starts as the focus and no-one ever reacts to
                  it as being unusual.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  Female leads in action movies are still a hot issue. Elsewhere
                  on the site we&#8217;ve had a blogpost on the movie
                  &#8220;Salt&#8221;, which got made because Angelina Jolie can
                  do
                  <em
                    >anything the hell she wants<\/em> in Hollywood, and
                    they\u2019re already reassured that she can handle guns and
                    car chases. But the press were astonished at the idea of a
                    woman playing a role which had been written for a male
                    spy.<\/p>\n
                    <p>
                      I would dearly love to see something that has a truly
                      interchangeable lead. A fully-rounded character with
                      opinions and instincts, but one which could be equally
                      played by a man or a woman. What would be really
                      interesting is \u201cPerson X has a love interest Y, and
                      doesn\u2019t get on with their ex, Z\u201d. Now roll some
                      dice to decide which gender everyone is.<\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      For me, Bechdel isn&#8217;t the point. It proves itself,
                      and is therefore a useful barometer for how female roles
                      are being treated across the industry, but it
                      doesn&#8217;t tell you about the movie or show. Fringe
                      goes way beyond it, and the interesting parts about Fringe
                      aren&#8217;t described by the pass\/fail: the female
                      characters are SO strong that it&#8217;s the struggle of
                      wills between Olivia and Nina that is really behind the
                      drive to reveal or cover the truth, not the men.<\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      For example, another TV show which passes the test (but
                      this time just barely) is the unashamedly cowboy-centred
                      modern police story <a
                      href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt1489428\/\"><strong
                        >Justified<\/strong><\/a>.\u00a0 At one point it has the
                        main character\u2019s current lover and ex-wife talk to
                        each other, but naturally includes him as a subject of
                        the conversation. Given their romantic connection to him
                        and the tension between them right at that moment which
                        comes from it, it\u2019s not an ignorant fail on the
                        part of the writers. It would be bizarre for him
                        <em
                          >not<\/em> to be a topic of conversation&#8230; but
                          this example is typical of the few times that two
                          women talk to each other in a lot of movies and
                          TV.<\/p>\n
                          <p>
                            In this case the lead is once again a white male,
                            but the show\u2019s entire existence is due to the
                            actor playing a Sheriff in (the excellent)

                                          that male viewers will vomit
                                          themselves into a coma after being
                                          exposed to anything more than 5
                                          seconds of it. (This is actually true
                                          for Grey\u2019s Anatomy, but then it
                                          had that effect on EVERYONE after the
