Diary] What I&#8217;ve been playing&#8230; September

<p>
  First off, my apologies for being so late with this edition of Playing!
  \u00a0I work in a university, and the arrival of freshers and term starting
  again has made everything a little hectic. My secondary reason is that of the
  two new games I was playing in September, I\u00a0<em
    >still<\/em> haven&#8217;t finished either, and I didn&#8217;t want to give
    half-prepared reviews. \u00a0However, as time drags on I feel I must bring
    you something!<\/p>\n
    <p>
      So I bring you a short and sweet look at\u00a0<strong
        >Torchlight 2\u00a0<\/strong> and some interesting developments re:
        Booth Babes.<\/p>\n
        <p>
          <a title=\"Torchlight 2 game\"
          href=\"http:\/\/www.torchlight2game.com\/\"
          target=\"_blank\">Torchlight 2<\/a>\u00a0is an adventure RPG that has
          a slightly more cartoon-like presentation than big-budget rivals like
          <strong
            >Diablo III<\/strong>. Despite this, it&#8217;s been a huge success.
            \u00a0It allows a lot more freedom than
            <strong
              >D3<\/strong> does when levelling up your character with skill
              points, and there&#8217;s character points to spend where\u00a0<em
                >you want<\/em>, not just automatically assigned.
                \u00a0There&#8217;s a great variety of skills to play with to
                suit your play style and your character. \u00a0I&#8217;m
                currently playing through as an <a title=\"Torchlight 2
                Character Class: Engineer\"
                href=\"http:\/\/www.torchlight2game.com\/classes\/engineer\"
                target=\"_blank\">Engineer<\/a>, and although long-range
                weaponry is an option I&#8217;m sticking with my two-handed
                melee weapons because I much prefer bashing my way through
                enemies. \u00a0That&#8217;s my example, but as I mentioned, I
                have yet to finish the game (or test the other classes out) so
                all I can do is advise you on what I know so far.<\/p>\n
                <p>
                  <img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft\" title=\"Screenshot
                  from Torchlight II\"

                </p>
                <p>
                  My favourite feature of the game is one&#8217;s pet.
                  \u00a0There&#8217;s more choice in this game than the first as
                  to what species of pet you have &#8211; I picked a ferret for
                  the novelty &#8211; and being able to dump items in Professor
                  Furzl&#8217;s inventory when mine is full is like a gift from
                  the gods of gaming. \u00a0No longer shall you agonise over
                  which rare item to pick up with only one space left in your
                  backpack!\u00a0Even better, you can send the pet to town with
                  a bag full of junk, and he&#8217;ll return to you
                  &#8211;\u00a0wherever\u00a0you are &#8211; with some lovely
                  gold coins. \u00a0Best feature ever.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  The final plus-side I&#8217;ll bring for you today is
                  <strong
                    >Torchlight 2<\/strong>&#8216;s price: \u00a315\/$20, which
                    is half (or less) than what you&#8217;ll be paying for the
                    big-budget, AAA+, giant developer titles (I think I paid
                    \u00a335 for Diablo 3 on release). \u00a0The smaller price
                    doesn&#8217;t give you any less enjoyment, I&#8217;ve found.
                    \u00a0It&#8217;s a great title with brilliant features, and
                    comes in at a decent price.<\/p>\n
                    <h3>
                      Now, a brief word on Booth Babes<\/h3>\n
                      <p>
                        \u00a0<br \ />\nYou probably know what I&#8217;m on
                        about here; you go to a show or an expo, and the
                        companies bring scantily clad women to sell their games.
                        \u00a0It&#8217;s insulting to the gamers and
                        there&#8217;s a lot of bad press about how these women
                        are treated, too. \u00a0Well, as of next year&#8217;s
                        show the Eurogamer Expo here in the UK will be <a
                        title=\"Eurogamer Booth Babe Ban\"
                        href=\"http:\/\/www.eurogamer.net\/forum\/thread\/242422\"
                        target=\"_blank\">formally enforcing a ban on booth
                        babes<\/a>. \u00a0Frankly, I am glad, but I fear that
                        those people who really don&#8217;t get the message will
                        still try and sell their games with
                        <em
                          >a little T&amp;A<\/em>. \u00a0We will have to see
                          what happens next year, but from my point of view, and
                          that of others I&#8217;ve spoken to on this topic,
                          it&#8217;s a step in the right direction!<\/p>\n
                          <p>
                            Hopefully by the next post I&#8217;ll have completed
                            at least one playthrough with
                            <strong
                              >Borderlands 2<\/strong>&#8230; which, as I
                              suspected it would be, is a secret feminist game.
