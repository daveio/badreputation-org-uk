  A couple of weekends ago I went to see the <a
  href=\"http:\/\/london.iwm.org.uk\/server\/show\/nav.24678\">Women War
  Artists<\/a> exhibition at the Imperial War Museum. I strongly recommend it
  for anyone with an interest in art and \/ or history as it\u2019s a great
  collection. I won\u2019t go through the exhibition work by work, but here is a
  <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/artanddesign\/gallery\/2011\/apr\/08\/women-war-artists-imperial-museum-in-pictures\">slideshow<\/a>
  of some of the key pieces and an <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/entertainment-arts-12992856\">audio
  slideshow<\/a> featuring curator and Head of Art at the Imperial War Museum
  Kathleen Palmer talking about some of the star items. If you\u2019re super
  keen I recommend <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.iwmshop.org.uk\/product\/22089\/Women_War_Artists\">buying
  the book<\/a> as there are many more artworks and artists in there than make
  it into the physical exhibition.<\/p>\n

  <p>
    Just to get one thing out of the way before I get stuck in: women artists
    are not an invention of the 20<sup
      >th<\/sup> Century, they have been around for a very long time indeed.
      Just because you may never have heard of them doesn\u2019t mean they
      don\u2019t exist or they weren\u2019t producing accomplished, arresting
      and intelligent works alongside male artists. But there are reasons you
      have never heard of them.<sup
        ><a href=\"#footnote_0_5944\" id=\"identifier_0_5944\"
        class=\"footnote-link footnote-identifier-link\" title=\" I wrote an
        article about that here, if you&rsquo;re interested.
        \">1<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n
        <p>
          Let\u2019s get another old chestnut out of the way: there\u2019s no
          feminine unity of theme, approach, subject or style in art produced by
          women, just as there\u2019s no equivalent in the work of men. However
          in small collections of art by any group you can sometimes see common
          patterns based on the conditions of production.\u00a0 For example very
          few of the works in Women War Artists directly depict combat. This is
          not womanly squeamishness, they weren\u2019t allowed on the field.
          Similarly there aren\u2019t many images of chisel-jawed tommies
          striding forth in a blaze of noble violence, because the government
          paid their official (and male) war artists to produce most of the top
          propaganda. Female artists were drafted in for specific jobs, for
          example Laura Knight\u2019s famous, glamorous portrait of <a
          href=\"http:\/\/www.citylife.co.uk\/img\/12885\/19983_star_piece_laura_knights_ruby_loftus.jpg\">Ruby
          Loftus<\/a>.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <h2>
          Unofficial artists<\/h2>\n
          <p>
            Britain has such a wealth of art documenting the experience of war
            not only because it was diligently collected by post-war art
            committees (including the Imperial War Museum Women\u2019s Work
            Sub-Committee, created in 1918) but also because the government
            commissioned artists to record the war. The first official war
            artists scheme was set up in 1916, to create propaganda and to
            commemorate the national war effort. 51 artists were commissioned,
            47 men and four women, and of these four, three had their work
            rejected and one did not take up the commission. But while there was
            no &#8220;official&#8221; female representation, women artists
            recorded the impact of the war on civilians, what they saw in the
            factories and military hospitals, as nurses, drivers and auxiliary
            staff close to the frontline.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            In the Second World War over 400 artists were commissioned, of whom
            52 were women. Only two were given overseas commissions and only one
            \u2013 <a
            href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Evelyn_Dunbar\">Evelyn
            Dunbar<\/a> &#8211; was given a salary. But again a rich body of
            \u2018unofficial\u2019 work by women emerged during and after the
            war, and this forms the bulk of the Women War Artists exhibition,
            documenting everything from queues at the fishmongers (fish was
            popular because it wasn\u2019t rationed) to shipyards and weapons
            factories, bombed out streets and army camps and hospitals.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <h2>
            Argh<\/h2>\n
            <p>
              To my mind the most powerful work in the exhibition, and in fact
              one of my favourite paintings full stop (because I think it\u2019s
              brilliant, not because I particularly want to look at it) is
              <em
                >Human Laundry<\/em> by Doris Zinkeisen. Commissioned by the
                British Red Cross to record their activities, Zinkeisen arrived
                at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945, soon after it
                was liberated. Her painting shows a scene in the stable that was
                nicknamed the \u2018human laundry\u2019 in which survivors were
                washed and de-loused by staff from a nearby German army hospital
                before being treated in the makeshift hospital at the
                camp.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_5946\" style=\"width: 410px\"

                  The contrast between the sparkling white uniforms and plump
                  pink arms and faces of the German nurses and the grey
                  emaciated bodies of the camp inmates is full of quiet horror.
                  The ambiguous, unreadable expression of the foreground nurse
                  and the blurred faces of the other nurses and the two doctors
                  also contrast with the realism and detail of the water
                  spreading across the floor, the texture of the metal buckets.
                  What were they thinking, as they washed these half dead
                  creatures? Whatever it is, we have no sign of their emotion.
                  Then there\u2019s the contrast between the tenderness and
                  intimacy associated with washing somebody and the industrial,
                  mechanical nature of this operation, underlining the sheer
                  scale of the task. They found 60,000 sick and starving people
                  at Belsen, alongside 10,000 corpses.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  I know you know this, I\u2019m sure you studied it at school
                  just like I did. But that\u2019s one of the main reasons war
                  art is so important \u2013 it\u2019s not just propaganda, it
                  communicates the human cost of war more powerfully than the
                  numbers do, or at least it does for me. I can\u2019t imagine
                  10,000 dead bodies. I can\u2019t really imagine 100. But I
                  look at a painting like
                  <em
                    >Human Laundry<\/em> and I can grasp it, the horror of
                    it.<\/p>\n
                    <p>
                      However, I think the painting also contains if not hope,
                      then the possibility of hope (or at least I feel it does
                      compared to <a
                      href=\"http:\/\/www.bergenbelsen.co.uk\/pages\/Database\/BuildingsHohnePhotographs.asp?BuildingsID=3&amp;Submit=View&amp;PhotographsID=1003&amp;index=0\">photographs<\/a>
                      of the same scene) The hope of a new beginning is present
                      in the symbolism of washing, and in the way that the water
                      spreads like a shadow across the bottom of the painting,
                      but the people are picked out in light.<\/p>\n

                        Across the way from the exhibition is another gallery,
                        which is just called \u2018The Art Collection\u2019 and
                        looks to be part of the museum\u2019s permanent
                        exhibitions. There are some very fine works in there as
                        well (John Piper! Paul Nash! &lt;3) but my companions
                        couldn\u2019t find any by women. I hope that when the
                        Women War Artists exhibition closes in January some of
                        the works will remain on permanent display alongside the
                        works of male artists rather than being returned
                        immediately to the vaults and forgotten all over
