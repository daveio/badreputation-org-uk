          It turns out that it&#8217;s only an actor playing the hapless bobby,
          because Edith is the person responsible for
          <em
            >teaching the Suffragettes jujutsu<\/em>.<\/p>\n
            <p>
              Before we ask how a middle-aged woman in a respectable hat was
              able to learn the (then barely discovered) Japanese martial art,
              let&#8217;s look at why she&#8217;d bother:<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                We have not yet made ourselves a match for the police, and we
                have got to do it. The police know jiu-jitsu. I advise you to
                learn jiu-jitsu. Women should practise it as well as men.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                We have got to have [military] drilling in the East End. If
                there is any man who has been in the Army or who knows anything
                about drilling, will he please communicate with me, and we will
                start drilling.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                You should all go out with your sticks [<a
                href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Indian_clubs\">Indian
                clubs<\/a> which were popular for exercise at the time, and
                easily hidden in clothing]. What is the use of demonstrating for
                freedom and going unarmed? Don\u2019t come to meetings without
                sticks in future, men and women alike. It is worth while really
                striking. It is no use pretending. We have got to fight.<br

                  in the New York Times<\/a> on Aug 12th 1913, shortly before

                  <p>
                    With the recent practice of police using
                    &#8220;kettling&#8221; to contain students during anti-cuts
                    protests, and any (very predictable) resulting violence
                    against police by the protesters subsequently being loudly
                    criticised in newspapers, it&#8217;s refreshing to see the
                    sentiments above. &#8216;Well, we have to learn jujutsu too,
                    or the police might be able to stop us. And obviously we
                    can&#8217;t have THAT. This is a protest! Get someone who
                    can make it happen and have him report to me immediately.
                    Next?&#8217; While the actions may cause debate today, the
                    sheer &#8216;nothing will stop us&#8217; attitude is
                    amazing.<\/p>\n

                  <p>
                    But Sylvia is not the focus of this post, much as we love
                    her here on BadRep. It&#8217;s Edith who is less well known
                    but also truly remarkable. She taught PE at a school and
                    married William, also a PE instructor, when she was 21 and
                    he 22. They moved to London and met the intriguing Edward
                    William Barton-Wright, who in 1899 started to teach them
                    both jujutsu.<\/p>\n
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I have to pause again and talk about Barton-Wright, because
                    England produces a unique brand of truly bonkers things and
                    he was definitely responsible for one of them which is of
                    great importance to this narrative.<\/p>\n<div

                      written in a later story as knowing the gentleman&#8217;s
                      martial art of &#8220;Baritsu&#8221;. This was a
                      mis-spelling of Barton&#8217;s invention, &#8220;<a

                      (Barton-jujitsu). Asian martial arts weren&#8217;t very
                      widely known in the West before 1900, and he was one of
                      the first instructors in Europe. It was a time when&#8230;
                      well, when men had moustaches and hats like those in the
                      accompanying image. Barton-Wright had learned Shinden Fudo
                      Ryu jujutsu and judo, and developed a new system for
                      English people of &#8216;class and bearing&#8217; to use
                      with dignity (and often a walking stick or
                      umbrella).<\/p>\n

                        It was his academy that Edith and her husband attended,
                        and they both went on to become students of <a
                        href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sadakazu_Uyenishi\">Sadakazu
                        Uyenishi<\/a> who taught there. When Uyenishi left his
                        own dojo a few years later, they took over as teachers
                        of that club in Soho. (Their daughter, Isabel, also
                        assisted them in running the dojo from 1911 onwards, at
                        the age of fifteen.)<\/p>\n

                      <p>
                        Edith was almost certainly the first female jujutsu
                        instructor in Europe. She and her husband continued
                        teaching until 1925 &#8211; but from 1908 she alone ran
                        some classes which were only open to
                        suffragettes.<\/p>\n

                        the quotes above, Edith didn&#8217;t hold back either.

                                  the protest movement she was part of is not
                                  just that she was a suffragette, or taught
                                  others to take on police during protests, but
                                  that she trained the 30 women known as
                                  &#8220;The Bodyguard&#8221;. This group was
                                  set up to prevent the frequent arrest of top
                                  suffragette protesters (the police would
                                  release those who were on hunger strike and

                                      during one public demonstration, a
                                      reporter from the Daily Mirror was invited
                                      to attack the 4&#8217;11&#8221; Edith on

                                      time, he wrote of his experiences in an

                                          crawled painfully away, pitying the

                                          Again and again in her story we see
                                          parallels to the student and anti-cuts
                                          protests earlier this year. The
                                          suffragettes knew that property damage
                                          meant headlines, but there were
                                          generally strict boundaries &#8211; no
                                          people were to be hurt, and no factory
                                          or other workplace was to be damaged
                                          where people&#8217;s jobs would be
                                          affected. One incident Edith was
                                          involved in was a gathering of women
                                          on Oxford Street, who, when Edith blew
                                          a whistle, pulled hammers and rocks
                                          from under their clothes and threw
                                          them through shop windows. This was
                                          seen as a logical, necessary and
                                          entirely justified action which had a
                                          place in protest, not just empty
                                          vandalism, and she defends it
                                          eloquently. Newspapers and blogs are
                                          still having that debate today.<\/p>\n

                                          She presented a suffragette petition
                                          to Lloyd George, who started to argue
                                          with her. Edith replied &#8220;Now
                                          then, you are dealing with a fellow
                                          countrywoman from the Welsh Valleys.
                                          Be sensible, man!&#8221; (She was born
                                          in Bath but grew up in Wales). They
                                          then had entirely civil conversations
                                          on more than one occasion, although
                                          never agreed on ideals.<\/p>\n<div

                                            more of the mind. Even at that age

                                            just and that you must therefore do
                                            everything to help protest succeed.
