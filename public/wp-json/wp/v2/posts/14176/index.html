    <p>
      Welcome back to
      <strong
        >Hopeless Reimantic Presents<\/strong>! <a
        href=\"http:\/\/badreputation.org.uk\/2013\/12\/04\/hopeless-reimantic-presents-anita-blake-vampire-hunter-part-one\"
        target=\"_blank\">Last time we got our teeth into
        <strong
          >Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter<\/strong><\/a>, and I found myself
          actually saying some pretty positive things about the books.
          (Honestly, I&#8217;m as surprised as you. My fourteen-year-old self is
          throwing one hell of a sulk.) It&#8217;s not the full story, though,
          and there&#8217;s still quite a lot about this series to
          unpack.<\/p>\n
          <p>
            First of all, there&#8217;s something I need to make clear: as I
            said in <a
            href=\"http:\/\/badreputation.org.uk\/2013\/12\/04\/hopeless-reimantic-presents-anita-blake-vampire-hunter-part-one\"
            target=\"_blank\">Part One<\/a>, I went into this review determined
            not to talk about the series in relation to Laurell K. Hamilton
            herself more than was necessary.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            I generally hold that unless an author has done something that I
            can&#8217;t reconcile myself to morally, I don&#8217;t feel like
            it&#8217;s my business to talk about their personal life when I am
            supposed to be reviewing their books. And from what I&#8217;ve read
            of Laurell K. Hamilton&#8217;s blog posts, she seems kind of
            entitled and I find her annoying, but&#8230;well, let&#8217;s just
            say that as far as I can tell she&#8217;s no Orson Scott Card. By
            and large my problems with the ideas she puts across can easily be
            expressed in criticism of her work rather than criticism of
            her.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            I ran into some problems with this approach, to be sure; the
            evidence for Anita Blake being the author&#8217;s avatar is pretty
            compelling. But for the purposes of analysing the text, I&#8217;m
            putting that debate to bed. From here on out, guys, they&#8217;re
            just books, so if anyone is reading this expecting it to be a
            catalogue of Ms Hamilton&#8217;s character flaws, well, it&#8217;s
            not going to be. Hashtag sorry not sorry, or something.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            Oh, one more thing: I&#8217;m limiting myself to a maximum of one
            book quotation per point here, because SEVENTEEN BOOKS LORD HAVE
            MERCY.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            Okay! Let&#8217;s get started. Where were we? Was I wanting to tear
            my eyes out? I think I was wanting to tear my eyes out.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            &#8230;I&#8217;m going to need to slip into a more concise format, I
            think, or that&#8217;s just going to be the entire article. Here,
            then, in no particular order, are My Main Problems with Anita Blake,
            Vampire Hunter:<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <h3>
            1) Anita only has one dating experience that I would describe as
            fully consensual.<\/h3>\n
            <p>
              She dates Richard, a werewolf, and then she gets engaged to
              Richard, and\u00a0<em
                >then<\/em> the vampire she&#8217;s been hanging out with
                decides that he needs &#8220;equal time&#8221; to win her over,
                or he&#8217;s got no choice but to duel Richard to the
                death:<\/p>\n
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    &#8220;You have dated him for months, and I have said
                    little. Before you marry him, I want equal
                    time.&#8221;<\/p>\n
                  </p>
                  <p>&#8230;<\/p>\n</p>
                  <p>
                    &#8220;I&#8217;ve been trying to avoid you for months.
                    I&#8217;m not just going to give in now.&#8221;<\/p>\n
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    &#8220;Then I will start the music, and we will dance. Even
                    if I die, and you die. Richard will die first, I can promise
                    you that. Surely dating me is not a fate worse than
                    death.&#8221;<\/p>\n
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    &#8211; Laurell K. Hamilton,

                      <p>(I&#8217;m not so sure about that, dude.)<\/p>\n</p>
                      <p>
                        There&#8217;s also the shapeshifter leopard who
                        basically just rapes her (it&#8217;s okay, she enjoys
                        it) and then is her mate and it&#8217;s all fine, and
                        the other shapeshifter leopard who is Terrifyingly
                        Submissive at her until she gives in (more on that
                        later). These are her four main men and, last I checked,
                        the various loves of her life.<\/p>\n
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        There are a couple of things at play here, and I can
                        intellectually grasp them both. One is that an easy way
                        to add darkness and tension to a story is to have your
                        main character interact with a world which doesn&#8217;t
                        recognise their morality, which is how we get all those
                        kind of racist &#8220;I was ravished by a
                        barbarian\/sheikh\/otherwise rich and dark-skinned
                        man&#8221; stories (remind me to talk to you about <a
                        href=\"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/2180276.The_Panther_and_the_Pearl\"
                        target=\"_blank\"><strong
                          >The Panther And The Pearl<\/strong><\/a> some time).
                          And that&#8217;s not necessarily a bad thing in a
                          fantasy world where you are dealing with beings that
                          might have witnessed the greater part of human
                          history. I do take the point that you might well not
                          care so much about pesky human morals when
                          you&#8217;ve been living off blood or sex or male
                          tears or whatever for about a thousand years.<\/p>\n
                          <p>
                            And, credit where it&#8217;s due, Laurell K.
                            Hamilton does make some effort to deal with the
                            effect this is having on Anita; she agonises, at
                            least initially, over the detachment she feels from
                            her humanity as she gets drawn deeper into the
                            preternatural world. Hamilton doesn&#8217;t really
                            take that conflict anywhere, which is a shame
                            because it makes the whole thing feel a bit too
                            insta-conflict for my liking, but she tries.<\/p>\n
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            The considerably more disturbing thing is the second
                            point, which is that this is supposed to be

                              but one thing that I think I missed there is
                              actually what I find grossest about this
                              particular fantasy &#8211; that being threatened
                              or coerced, either physically or by other means,

                              of part of a woman&#8217;s power and mystique.
                              It&#8217;s not that these guys are proto-rapists,
                              no &#8211; it&#8217;s that women are so damned
                              irresistible that they overwhelm men&#8217;s
                              judgement and common sense. Basically, they are

                                There is an element of pick-up artistry that
                                states that when you overcome LMR (last minute
                                resistance, usually to sex) you&#8217;re
                                actually doing the woman a favour, because
                                you&#8217;re taking the responsibility out of
                                her hands. She can&#8217;t be a slut, because
                                she&#8217;s not in control; you&#8217;re
                                preserving her purity while still giving her the
                                sex she wants. That is gross and messed-up and a
                                terrible bit of rape apologia, but it&#8217;s
                                the same kind of logic that I&#8217;m seeing
                                here; it&#8217;s a way to skirt around having
                                Anita own her own sexuality. She can&#8217;t
                                help it! She&#8217;s just got this

                                      It took me a while to realise this. I

                                        only okay for Anita Blake, and by

                                            Anita starts out the series not
                                            believing in pre-marital sex. She
                                            ends up having quite a lot of it,
                                            but there&#8217;s never a sense that
                                            she revises that belief, which would
                                            be really interesting if it
                                            didn&#8217;t have such weird
                                            implications for the other women in
                                            the books. Anita has sex because of
                                            deep love, a deep sense of
                                            obligation (erk) and\/or because she
                                            is a succubus. Metaphysical events
                                            or very strong emotion compel her to
                                            bone, and the fact that she ends up
                                            enjoying it immensely is somehow a
                                            coincidence, which is possibly the
                                            strangest permutation of the forced
                                            seduction trope I&#8217;ve ever
                                            seen. <\/p>\n

                                            And even that would be okay, were it
                                            not for the fact that every single
                                            other woman in the books who has sex
                                            for such a frivolous reason as the
                                            fact she just enjoys it is painted
                                            as either a) shallow and heinous, b)
                                            mentally unstable, or c)

                                              honest here; this isn&#8217;t just
                                              offensive, it&#8217;s lazy
                                              writing, in the same way that
                                              blaming serious criminal offences
                                              or terrorism on mental illness is
                                              lazy journalism. It&#8217;s a way
                                              to avoid grappling seriously with
                                              what could actually be some pretty
