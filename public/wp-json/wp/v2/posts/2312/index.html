<p>
  Regular readers will know I grew up in Cornwall, the land of old ladies. You
  have probably noticed that elderly women in popular culture are issued with
  just two personalities to share between them: the dear old biddy and the evil
  crone. This hasn\u2019t been my experience of actual old women &#8211; though
  I have met biddies and crones both &#8211; on the whole I have met people,
  with all the complexity and variety that entails.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  However one common characteristic did emerge, although this may be more to do
  with Cornwall than with old age: eccentricity. Some of the most bizarre and
  wonderful people I have ever met have been women in their 70s. Cornwall is
  full of them. And I can tell you they make &#8216;quirky&#8217; young women
  look like amateurs. I aspire to join their ranks. Don&#8217;t want to put too
  many teddy bears in your cat&#8217;s room in case he feels crowded? Written a
  play about an easter egg&#8217;s journey to self-understanding? Eat raw onions
  like apples? Genuinely believe you have a telepathic connection with that
  robin? JOIN US.<\/p>\n

  \/><\/a>So imagine my delight on receiving a novel almost entirely populated
  by said ladies. You may already know about Surrealist painter Leonora
  Carrington (if not, here&#8217;s a quick primer on <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.thefword.org.uk\/reviews\/2010\/09\/looking_for_leo\">The
  F Word<\/a> and some decent-sized <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.all-art.org\/art_20th_century\/carrington1.html\">images<\/a>
  of her work) but you may not know that she was also a writer. One of her books
  is
  <strong
    >The Hearing Trumpet<\/strong>, which features 92-year-old Marian Leatherby
    as its polite, sensible and intrepid heroine.<\/p>\n
    <p>
      Marian\u2019s adventures begin when she is given a hearing trumpet as a
      gift. She overhears her son and daughter-in-law\u2019s plans to install
      her in a medieval Spanish castle that has been converted into a home for
      old ladies. There a mystery begins, involving a decidedly witchy 18thC
      Abbess, the Holy Grail, and a plate of poisoned brownies. Trying to
      describe the plot doesn&#8217;t really do it justice, just go and read it.
      If you mixed a bit of Angela Carter, Spike Milligan, Agatha Christie and
      Roald Dahl together you might get something close. It&#8217;s enchanting
      and funny, and makes for a refreshing encounter with Surrealism
      <em
        >sans<\/em> machismo.<\/p>\n
        <p>
          In a cast of old women there are no crones and just one biddy: kind,
          timid Maude. Although even she is not what she appears to be. Instead
          the reader is introduced to glamorous and cynical Georgina,\u00a0
          Veronica, who is blind, painting endless watercolours, dignified and
          enigmatic Christabel, religious visionary Natacha, graceful French
          Marquise Claude, frantic Anna, and Natacha\u2019s devoted spiritual
          disciple Vera.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          In her 2005 introduction to
          <strong
            >The Hearing Trumpet<\/strong> author Ali Smith wonders if the
            decision to write a story with such an elderly narrator and
            characters was \u201ca reaction against Carrington\u2019s Surrealist
            objectification as astonishingly gifted child-woman\u201d. The idea
            of the
            <em
              >femme-enfant<\/em> was very important to the Surrealist movement,
              as her spontaneity and innocence (supposedly untainted by logic or
              rational thought) were felt to bring her closer to the
              unconscious. Though of course equating female creativity with
              youth left little room for the women associated with the movement
              to mature and develop as artists.<\/p>\n<div

              <p>
                While the book is very definitely concerned with feminine
                experience, creativity and spirituality, there is no trace of an
                oppressive female essentialism. This is partly because old age
                has rendered most of the characters a little androgynous: Marian
                explains that she has \u201ca short grey beard which
                conventional people would find repulsive. Personally I find it
                rather gallant.&#8221; But also because the book seems largely
                uninterested in restricting the feminine to the female.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                As well as the ladies of Lightsome Hall there is Marian&#8217;s
                best friend Carmella, who writes letters to strangers, smokes
                cigars, brings port in a hot water bottle to evade confiscation,
                and devises audacious plans to spring Marian from the home.
                Their friendship is one of the loveliest aspects of the book,
                and was inspired by Leonora Carrington&#8217;s close friendship
                with fellow painter Remedios Varo.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                Varo is less well known in the UK than Carrington, despite the
                success she found in her adopted home of Mexico &#8211; here are
                a few of her <a
                href=\"http:\/\/www.all-art.org\/art_20th_century\/varo2.html\">paintings<\/a>.
                Their work shares some common themes and motifs, with both
                exploring mysticism and the significance of ritual, as well as
                drawing heavily on the natural world. In her biography of Varo,
                <strong
                  >Unexpected Journeys<\/strong>, Janet Kaplan writes:<\/p>\n
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>
                      Traveling together into what the poet Adrienne Rich has
                      called \u2018the cratered night of female memory,\u2019
                      they undertook a shared process of self-discovery, working
                      together to probe the possibility of woman\u2019s creative
                      power. Through their exploration of hermetic and magical
                      paths, they developed a common pictorial language, derived
                      from the realms of domestic life, the fairy tale and the
                      dream.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Their shared and similar experiences built a strong sense
                      of mutual trust between them, not least the fact they had
                      both recently been in detention \u2013 Carrington was
                      incarcerated in a Spanish asylum following a mental
                      breakdown, and Varo was interned in France for several
                      months at the start of the Second World War.
                      Carrington\u2019s mistrust of institutions, family and
                      doctors is very clear in
                      <strong
                        >The Hearing Trumpet<\/strong>, which ends with a
                        joyful, absurd, anarchic revolution in society and in
                        nature.<\/p>\n
                        <p>
                          While they regularly spoofed their friendship in
                          stories and letters to each other, its affectionate
                          portrayal in
                          <strong
                            >The Hearing Trumpet<\/strong> is the best known,
                            and particularly poignant now as Leonora Carrington
                            is still alive and older than Marian Leatherby, but
                            Remedios Varo died in 1963 in her early 50s.<\/p>\n
                            <p>
                              It\u2019s a strange and wonderful book, which I
                              would heartily recommend to anyone with a taste
                              for the peculiar and a playful sense of humour. Go
                              on, it\u2019ll brighten your January, trust
