  No doubt most of you will have heard of <a title=\"Kickstarter\"
  href=\"http:\/\/www.kickstarter.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Kickstarter<\/a>,
  the crowdfunding platform for creative projects. If this were a newspaper the
  headline would probably be &#8220;Move over boys&#8221; or &#8220;The
  feminists are coming&#8221; or something like that because I&#8217;m going to
  point out that there are some feminists using it.<\/p>\n

<h3>
  Kickstarter<\/h3>\n
  <p>
    I like Kickstarter because of its pleasing by-the-people-for-the-people
    ethos and the fact it gives independent filmmakers, writers, musicians and
    artists a chance to make their ideas a reality. It&#8217;s all very
    &#8216;open&#8217; as they say. In fact <a
    href=\"http:\/\/opensource.com\/business\/10\/1\/giving-creative-projects-community-kickstart\">Open
    Source blog<\/a> says this:<\/p>\n
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      The beauty of Kickstarter is that it bypasses the traditional channels
      artists would need to navigate in order to fund a project. Here funding
      depends on community participation rather than closed-door gatekeepers.
      The individual investments can be small and spread among those who care
      about that project\u2019s success.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      What we have here of course is also a fantastic opportunity for political
      or minority groups to get unpopular projects off the ground, projects that
      would never be able to attract funding from traditional investors (who
      tend to be of the wealthy white male variety) because they can&#8217;t see
      the &#8216;market&#8217; for them.<\/p>\n

          A project I&#8217;d been following for a long time before it was at

          target=\"_blank\">The Illusionists<\/a>:<\/p>\n

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            The Illusionists is a feature-length documentary about the
            commodification of the body and the marketing of unattainable beauty
            around the world.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            The film will explore the influence that corporations have on our
            perceptions of ourselves, showing how mass media, advertising and
            several industries manipulate people&#8217;s insecurities about
            their bodies for profit.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n

            Having followed its development over the last couple of years I
            think its going to be a corker. And it&#8217;s not quite at its
            funding target yet, so you know&#8230; *cough* stump up!

            Microloans for women in the developing world<\/h3>\n
            <p>
              The idea of crowdfunding has taken off in a big way over the last
              couple of years, and it&#8217;s often linked to the microfinance
              initiative in development, particularly in relation to empowering
              women.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              There is something quite thrilling about using <a title=\"Kiva\"
              href=\"http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Kiva<\/a> or
              another platform to give funding directly to a woman in Kenya or
              Nepal to help her start a business. And of course you get your
              money back so you don&#8217;t have to lose any time worrying
              whether genuine altruism really exists.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              However it&#8217;s worth bearing in mind that even though you may
              be helping one woman, her family and maybe her community (which is
              nothing to be sniffed at!) spreading capitalism to every corner of
              the earth isn&#8217;t necessarily the best way to help women as a
              group. Microloans don&#8217;t do much to tackle the structural
              causes of poverty and inequality. In fact they <a

              women.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              Don&#8217;t stop giving, but think about giving to projects that
              will also help women protect themselves from violence, disease and
              discrimination while they run their business.<\/p>\n<div
