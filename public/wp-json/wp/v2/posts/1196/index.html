  FINALLY. It&#8217;s a fortnight late, but I couldn&#8217;t
  <em
    >not<\/em> post about <a href=\"http:\/\/ladyfestten.com\/\"><strong
      >Ladyfest Ten<\/strong><\/a>. Rather than reviewing the whole event
      &#8211; there&#8217;s quite a few reviews floating around by now &#8211; I
      thought I&#8217;d just spotlight the best picks from my rucksack-hoard of
      discoveries.<\/p>\n
      <p>
        For those for whom this blog is a First Foray into feminist websites,
        what is a Ladyfest? Well, they happen worldwide &#8211; <a
        href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ladyfest\">here&#8217;s
        Wikipedia&#8217;s entry<\/a>. Succinctly, they&#8217;re community-based
        arts and culture festivals focussed on women creating culture and
        campaigning for social change. The first one was in 2000 in the US;
        today Ladyfests go on all over the world. This one, my first, was the
        decade-marker!<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        Sarah J, Jenni and I pitched up on the Saturday afternoon with
        &#8220;Rest of the Fest&#8221; tix. I went for a wander in the stalls of
        the Lady Garden (you read that correctly). Hence, without further
        ado:<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">FIVE THINGS I FOUND AT
