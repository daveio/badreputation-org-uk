<p>
  I went to
  <strong
    >SlutWalk<\/strong> on Saturday. It was a lovely thing; banners, posters,
    chanting, brilliant footwear and some truly magnificent outfits all around
    and about in the inspiring and fun atmosphere. I wore a tank top and
    spray-on jeans and cooked to death, but the BadRep banner was proudly borne
    aloft through the heat and the billions of photographs that were taken of
    it, and I think I did us justice.<\/p>\n
    <p>
      Mostly, it was lovely to see so many people rallying to the cause of
      (primarily, but not exclusively) women being able to wear what they want
      in public without it being seen as consent to harassment and assault.
      It&#8217;s true. Consent to sexual activity is divorced from anything
      other than what we say. Nothing else consents for us.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, we went clubbing, and on the way home on the tube, some men used me
      as their paid-for amusement for the evening against my will.<\/p>\n

      I was wearing this: <a

      So I stood out, yes. Get
      <em
        >in.<\/em> I looked the fucking
        <em
          >business<\/em>, people. We&#8217;d just been to a club whereby
          anything went as far as costume went, and I&#8217;m a guy that will
          jump at any opportunity to tart up. Thus, tarted up I was.<\/p>\n
          <p>
            I was hassled for photographs by some young men who only cursorily
            asked whether they could get a picture of me before pawing me and
            grabbing me and threatening me. But that&#8217;s fine, if awful
            &#8211; I could deal with that. I&#8217;ve dealt with that before.
            They were young and quite drunk, for what it&#8217;s worth, not that
            it\u2019s an excuse.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            I clocked a group of people, some men and some attached women,
            checking me out and talking amongst themselves further down the
            carriage. As I watched, one of them &#8211; a young man,
            approximately a few years older than me &#8211; stalked down towards
            me, looking at my body as he went. He looked at my face, my jawline,
            my throat, my chest, my waist and my hips. He continued past me, and
            continued his observation of my body from behind. He said nothing,
            and got out his phone and started fiddling with it.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            Intimidated, I moved to put my back to the wall of the carriage,
            next to the door, and told him that if he wished to take my picture
            as well, he could ask.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            He looked up. &#8220;Oh,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t want
            to take your picture. It&#8217;s just that my mates have a bet on as
            to whether you&#8217;re male or female.&#8221;<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            It couldn&#8217;t have hurt me more suddenly or sharply if
            he&#8217;d slapped me. He had been assessing my body to see whether
            I was of the female-assigned-at-birth or male-assigned-category. I
            bristled. &#8220;Firstly, I&#8217;m male,&#8221; I hissed,
            &#8220;and secondly, I&#8217;m not a fucking
            <em
              >zoo<\/em> exhibit. I am actually quite offended.&#8221;<\/p>\n
              <p>
                &#8220;Hey, calm down,&#8221; he started, before my best friend
                Mim stepped in to ask him, in my defence, what sort of entitled
                arsehole he thought he was, and what gave him the right to use
                me as his amusement? Would he put bets on whether someone was
                gay or straight?<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                &#8220;I just wanted to know what
                <em
                  >she<\/em> was dressed as,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n
                  <p>
                    Not only had I been gawped and ogled at like a caged animal,
                    he didn&#8217;t even take my own word for my own gender.
                    Apparently, his opinion based on his flawed assessment of my
                    physicality over-rode my own identity. I had my identity
                    casually erased before my eyes. Despite my protestations, I
                    wasn&#8217;t human to him. I wasn&#8217;t a person. I was a
                    freak, an indeterminate outsider, and therefore he found it
                    acceptable to treat me like subhuman filth.<\/p>\n
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This may sound minor to some of you. He never touched me, he
                    never hit me, raped me, spat at me, threw a beer can at me
                    &#8211; none of the things he could have done. I got off
                    lightly. I&#8217;m still intact, aren&#8217;t I? No swabs,
                    police reports or bruises.<\/p>\n
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But he&#8217;ll have got home and laughed with his friends
                    about how they hassled this weird girl on the tube who
                    thought she was a man and forget all about it. I
                    won&#8217;t. I&#8217;m not going to forget. Every time I
                    wonder if there&#8217;s a place for me in society,
                    it&#8217;ll be his face and words I remember. I&#8217;ll
                    remember how he looked at my body &#8211; the very thing I
                    fret about every morning to dress carefully around so that
                    people won&#8217;t see my tiny waist and curvy bottom and
                    think, &#8220;That&#8217;s a girl&#8221; &#8211; and how his
                    cissexist assessment of my shape nullified my
                    identity.<\/p>\n

                    We had a march that very morning about this, didn&#8217;t
                    we? Women marching, unified by their contempt for the
                    assumption that they are somehow to blame for their own
                    assault and victimisation. A Facebook event was made, and it
                    ballooned! We had a whole march! And do you remember the <a

                    kicked-out guys.<\/p>\n

                      anger and outrage for the trans* people? It&#8217;s still
                      the Seventies for us in many respects. The internet-based
                      feminist communities are slowly but surely opening their
                      arms to us, but we&#8217;re still widely invisible. <a

                          there&#8217;d be about three people there. <a

                          who were directly in contact with a trans* person.
                          We&#8217;re invisible. But we&#8217;re here. And as
                          the social atmosphere changes from hostility to
