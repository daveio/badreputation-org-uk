<p>
  Over the weekend, Viktoriya and I went to a fanzine fair at <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.constructiongallery.co.uk\/\">The Construction
  Gallery<\/a>, a pop-up arts space in Tooting. We were excited by this, and not
  just because we didn&#8217;t have to venture far from home. I&#8217;m really
  cheered by the huge upswing in arty, crafty, DIY community stuff that&#8217;s
  happening right now, like the <a
  href=\"http:\/\/handmadeintooting.wordpress.com\/crafty-pint\/\">Crafty
  Pint<\/a> series of making-stuff-inna-pub. It makes me feel connected to
  things that are going on locally, and I love the mash-up of traditional
  &#8220;feminine&#8221; pursuits, like <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/2011\/09\/28\/guest-post-craft-is-a-feminist-issue\/\">sewing<\/a>,
  in traditional &#8220;masculine&#8221; environments like the pub. It&#8217;s
  almost as if people of all genders could get involved. Serious.<\/p>\n
</p>
<h3>
  &#8220;I used to write for a &#8216;zine back when there was no
  internet&#8230;&#8221;<\/h3>\n
  <p>
    But to the &#8216;zines. I used to write for a fanzine, back in sixth form,
    when I was trying to be as cool as the girl who made the fanzine in
    question, who wanted to be a music journalist and who didn&#8217;t like Kula
    Shaker so I had to pretend not to like them either (but I did, and I do). I
    remember getting super excited over the fact that I was holding in my hand
    something that I had helped to make, and seeing my art in print for the
    first time. It made me realise that I could actually be creative, that there
    were things I could physically make outside of the dismal sessions of Art
    Class where I woefully, grudgingly failed to reproduce any of the techniques
    of the grand masters. This involved scissors and glue and a photocopier.
    <em
      >I could totally do those things!<\/em> I did pictures for two issues,
      until teenage bitching meant that no one was talking to anyone and it all
      got a bit fraught.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_10036\" style=\"width:

      <p>
        So that was my experience. I&#8217;m glad to say that
        <em
          >other<\/em> people are still making fanzines, and that they are
          varied, beautiful, different and amazing. I spent a tenner on a stack
          of &#8216;zines and came home giddy with the fact I owned little bits
          of art, thought and lovely stuff. Counter culture. I was gobsmacked
          with the array of fanzines on offer and made even happier when I
          realised how fucking feminist all of it was. And how diverse that
          feminism felt. All kinds of people were making all kinds of cool,
          gender-diverse, body-shape positive, politically forward things. Which
          were funny. And nice to look at.<\/p>\n
          <p>Here are some of my faves.<\/p>\n</p>

              I fell in love with <a
              href=\"http:\/\/www.creepclub.co.uk\/nancy\/\"><strong
                >Nancy<\/strong><\/a> just from the cover alone, and more so
                when I read the contents. A series of personal essays, rants and
                raves on the subject of effeminate gay men and why there is such
                antagonism towards them both within mainstream AND gay culture.
                A seriously smart read, which delivers one gay chap&#8217;s take
                on queer theory sliced through with pics of Lady Gaga and Brian
                Molko. I particularly enjoyed the list of &#8216;positive femme
                men&#8217;. <a

                    exactly what it said on the cover. A whole bunch of artists
                    had done different pages, in different styles, giving
                    stories and pictures about women as varied as <a

                        out from its photocopied sisters. The rich, lush artwork

                            I really liked the curvy, sexy heroine &#8211;
                            depicted on the cover in a seashell like Venus, but
                            clothed in a polka dot dress. The simple storylines
                            unfolded into wonderful fantasies: a bit of cotton
                            candy becomes a pink cloud landscape where she
                            sculpts her own David; a piece of apple grows into a
                            new Eden complete with Adam. This was a real change
                            from the lycra-clad hardbodies and explosion-tasms
                            of the usual suspect superheroines I&#8217;ve become
                            so used to seeing. This comic focused on her
                            desires, rather than using her as a vehicle for the
                            (assumed straight male) reader.<\/p>\n
