  Alright, so here\u2019s one last, slightly late poke at
  <strong
    >Game of Thrones<\/strong>. Things that are worth discussing but which
    didn\u2019t fit in the <a
    href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/2011\/06\/27\/game-of-thrones-redux\/\">main
    recap<\/a> at the end of the series. As with last time,
    <strong
      >there may well be spoilers ahead<\/strong>.<\/p>\n
      <p>
        First up, there\u2019s something interesting about the way the series
        presented sexuality. Straight sex was shown in abundance, with not one
        episode going by that failed to meet HBO\u2019s Mandatory Nipple Quota.
        That said, very little of it was what you could consider
        \u201cordinary\u201d &#8211; instead we get an array of incest,
        non-consent and prostitution. We never see Ed and Catelyn Stark
        together, or any of the show\u2019s other (non-sibling) couples. The
        closest we have is Danaerys and Drogo, and by the time their partnership
        becomes less disturbingly non-consensual we pretty much stop seeing them
        as well. Straight sex, then, is abundant but somehow always
        unpleasant.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_6595\" style=\"width: 310px\"

        style=\"text-align: left;\">Homosexual acts are distinctly less common
        in the series. Between female characters we get some slight implications
        with Danaerys and one of her serving girls as she learns how to please
        Drogo, a scene that is noticeably less graphic than the straight scenes
        in the show. The one time we are shown things by the same standards is a
        particularly unusual scene. The focus throughout is pretty much entirely
        on Lord Baelish as he instructs two recently arrived prostitutes. The
        scene is somewhat reminiscent of moments from (link is not worksafe) <a
        href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=aPL8TTjn_KY\">American
        Psycho<\/a>, where Bateman does much the same, the sex a mere sideshow
        to his monologue. It places the male character directly at the centre of
        the scene and becomes almost parodic as Lord Baelish informs one of the
        pair to \u201cbe the man\u201d in their actions.<\/p>\n<p
        style=\"text-align: left;\">And lastly, gay male pairings. We get one,
        and it\u2019s an interesting one. On the one hand, it\u2019s
        significantly more overt than it is in the books. Where the books give
        us a few sly remarks and implications from people, HBO pretty much
        flashes a giant neon \u201cHEY GUYS, THEY\u2019RE BONING\u201d sign. And
        yet nothing is actually shown, only implied by sound effects, and the
        pair are then immediately written out for the rest of the series. Yes,
        they leave in the books as well, but given that HBO has already shown
        willingness to make changes, why not go a little further and develop
        them more fully? Certainly, HBO hasn\u2019t shown a problem showing male
        relationships in past titles &#8211; see Michael Hall and Mathew St.
        Patrick in
        <strong
          >Six Feet Under<\/strong>, for example. So why the shying away this
          time?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Next up, issues of race.
          These have been widely discussed across the internet (see for example
          <a
          href=\"http:\/\/thedisorderofthings.wordpress.com\/2011\/06\/21\/race-gender-and-nation-in-game-of-thrones-2011\/\">this<\/a>,
          which we recently linked to), so I won\u2019t go into it too much
          here. In summary, the handling of race is fairly disappointing and the
          presentation of the Dothraki never rises much above the Savage Other.
          The one key comparison that really illustrates this, and which is
          worth talking about in a little more depth takes place in the first
          episode.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_6594\" style=\"width: 310px\"

          this awfully tiresome uncivilisation.<\/p><\/div>\n
          <p>
            The Starks, as we are first introduced to them, are going about the
            business of executing a deserter from the Night\u2019s Watch, the
            brotherhood that guards the great wall in the North. It\u2019s all
            shown as very grim and honourable, in that way that the Starks are
            throughout the series. No one takes any joy in it, but it\u2019s a
            necessary task and the younger Starks learn a lesson about duty and
            suchlike from watching this poor chap get beheaded. Later we see the
            marriage celebrations for Danaerys and Khal Drogo. It\u2019s a wild
            party with dancing and public sex. A fight breaks out over one of
            the women, ending with the disembowelling of the loser. Two public
            deaths, two very different contexts. When the (very, very white) men
            of the North kill someone it\u2019s honourable and we sympathise
            with them. When the Dothraki do it it\u2019s savage and lets us know
            that they\u2019re Not Like Us. And that\u2019s a problem.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly, a minor character worth discussing: Lysa Tully, sister to
            Catelyn Stark. She\u2019s an uncomfortable character, and a hard one
            to depict tastefully. If Cersei Lannister has something of the
            manipulative Lady Macbeth to her portrayal, Lysa Tully is entirely
            caught in the moment of \u201cout damned spot, out I say!\u201d
            Driven into a state of paranoid mania following the death of her
            husband, and with an entirely inappropriate relationship with her
            sickly son, there\u2019s just something awkward about the
            implications of her character. As with a few others (notably Hodor),
            it\u2019s a character that it\u2019s hard to see how HBO could have
            done right without massively deviating from the source
            material.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            Okay, that\u2019s the last I\u2019m going to say on
            <strong
              >Game of Thrones<\/strong> until season two rolls round. In the
              mean time, book five is finally out after a generation-long wait,
              so there\u2019s that to get through between now and next
              spring.<\/p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div
