<p>
  This is in some ways a sequel to my last post <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/2012\/02\/08\/the-maenads-are-in-the-gym-meditations-on-80s-fitness-videos\/\">on
  80s fitness videos<\/a>. But if you missed that one, fear not, for here is the
  backstory: gremlins have taken over my body and given me a sudden interest in
  physical fitness.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  In particular, I have been interested to see how the ideologies and
  assumptions of the real-life, modern-day gym contrast with the 80s fantasy
  world to which, until now, my side-bends and sit-ups have been largely
  confined.<\/p>\n
</p>
<h3>
  Ain&#8217;t got a motor in the back of her Honda<\/h3>\n
  <p>
    I wanted to start with a class. My local facility was offering a number of
    options for my preferred time of day: Spinning, Yoga, Body Attack and Body
    Pump. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.spinning.com\/\">Spinning<\/a>, of course, has
    long been a
    <strong
      >Cosmo<\/strong>-favourite, but it sounded a bit too terrifying for my
      tentative post-Christmas explorations, so I went for Body Pump because
      it&#8217;s on a Tuesday, and Tuesdays are good for me.<\/p>\n
      <p>
        Like Body Attack, Body Pump originates with the New
        Zealand-based\u00a0<a
        href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Les_Mills_International\">Les
        Mills workout group<\/a>.\u00a0I suppose I&#8217;d always known,
        objectively, that someone must make up these workouts, but I&#8217;d
        always vaguely assumed it was the class instructor, or the gym, or
        something. I certainly hadn&#8217;t realised there are whole
        organisations dedicated to churning them out &#8211; of which Les Mills
        is one.\u00a0Body Pump was the first of their workouts to make it out of
        New Zealand and into Europe, which it did in the early-to-mid-90s.
        It&#8217;s now pretty much a young professional gym standard, along with
        the emerging new trend, PowerPlate (which claims to deal with cellulite,
        although what doesn&#8217;t [and what does?], frankly).<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <h3>
        Never stray too far from the sidewalk<\/h3>\n

          In addition to\u00a0a kind of\u00a0<a

          titles, Les Mills also has about them something of the cultish air
          that also characterises Jane Fonda&#8217;s seminal 1980s oeuvre. <a

            Scary stuff. The almost-militarism of the Les Mills style plays out
            into the actual Body Pump workout, which is a weight training class
            accompanied by &#8216;chart-topping hits&#8217; (well&#8230;
            &#8216;Because of You&#8217;). Its use of zeitgeisty-kinda music to
            drive you along aligns it with aerobics more generally, but with the
            80s fitness craze in particular, which was similarly interwoven with
            pop culture, including the emergent disco culture\u00a0(the
            seminal\u00a0<strong
              >Saturday Night Fever<\/strong>,\u00a0with its all-dancing star <a
              href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Yu8z1DIMe9Q\">John
              Travolta<\/a>,\u00a0came out in 1977).<\/p>\n
              <p>
                But Body Pump is no\u00a0leotard-wearing 80s-style
                &#8216;jazzercise&#8217; with instructors whose hair flows wild
                and impractically free (my school gym teacher used to make us
                use elastic bands as a punishment for forgetting proper hair
                ties) &#8211; and, unlike the films Jane Fonda made for
                housewives everywhere, Body Pump&#8217;s not, primarily, about
                women. Indeed, it was originally designed to \u2018bring men
                into the aerobics room\u2019, after the female-focused group
                exercise trends that preceded it. Whether former female
                dominance in said room was because women are known to prefer
                exercising in nice social groups (cos, you know, that&#8217;s
                how we go to the toilet and choose our clothes, isn&#8217;t
                it?), or because instructors were targeting women as
                particularly vulnerable to body fascism, is too big a question
                to address in whole here.<\/p>\n

                        female. As is the instructor herself, though she&#8217;s

                        (&#8216;this is for the wibble-wobbles on the inner

                        with a sense of shared understanding much akin to what
                        you might experience in the disco toilets at 2am with
                        mascara running down your face, only with more brutalist
                        physical pain &#8211; Body Pump is more like that bit in

                            Indeed, whereas the 80s fitness dream was one of
                            self-improvement and the drive for the Body
                            Beautiful, Body Pump and the Les Mills ideology is
                            actually more like a War on Fat, with concomitantly
                            refigured notions of gender &#8211; men and women
                            exercise side by side, with parallel physical
                            goals.<\/p>\n

                            dance-fitness (sexualised to an often ludicrous

                            of militant A-team dream.\u00a0This probably has a

                            rather more of a general health priority than it
                            once was, but since the original 80s fitness craze
                            rose at much the same time as the rise of the disco

                            tangentially following our terpsichorean

                            itself around the idea of maenadic levels of
                            adrenaline, but in a kind of nightclub context. I
                            have to NB here that I go to a rather Executive gym
                            chain, which to be honest is probably actually
                            constructed in the 80s power-professional mould
                            &#8211; there&#8217;s coloured strip-lighting and
                            everyone&#8217;s wearing matchy-matchy black lycra
                            &#8230;and thongs. (I mean, seriously, think about
                            the physics of that. There will be squats.). In
                            Spinning it goes literal, as the room is darkened
                            and there&#8217;s pounding rave music (at 7am on a
                            Monday morning).<\/p>\n
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            So where does this leave us? Much of this may seem
                            largely irrelevant, since the numbers of women who
                            attend the gym (indeed, the numbers who can even
                            afford it) are relatively small compared to the
                            population at large. And yet! What happens in those
                            harrowing halls may reflect some curious external
                            trends.<\/p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy

                                                  to my last post, on 80s
                                                  fitness videos. But if you

                                                  interest in physical
