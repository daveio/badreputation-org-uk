  A bit late to the internet table on this one, which was meant to be part of
  the <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/tag\/revolting-women\/\">Women in
  Protest<\/a> series (sorry!).<\/p>\n

  For those of you who don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m a massive foodie. I will
  happily spend an entire day poncing around making dinner from scratch for my
  friends (including sugar-coating rose petals for Rose Martinis. Helpful hint:
  overdo it and they glue to saucers, never to come off). I was the only person
  at school who wanted to take Home Economics at A Level, with the result that
  it didn&#8217;t run so I had to do Chemistry instead, which is just Maths
  Cookery anyway *ducks*.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  So, I love food, food prep and all things kitchen related. Yet there&#8217;s a
  Bad Reputation (geddit?) between women, feminism and kitchens, and I&#8217;d
  like to talk about that. Not just in the wake of the <a

      Women&#8217;s Lib, to coin an old phrase, has been linked to the rise of
      labour saving household appliances, yet it&#8217;s a fact that women do <a
      href=\"http:\/\/www.anythingbutwork.com\/society\/women-shopping.htm\">most
      of the shopping and cooking<\/a>, probably because whilst we&#8217;ve made
      great leaps forward in terms of being able to vote and not being treated
      as the property of husbands, there&#8217;s still a massive social
      expectation around looking after the home. <a
      href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Separate_Spheres\">Separate
      Spheres<\/a> for the 21st century.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, on a practical front, this means that it&#8217;s women who are often
      in control of what a family eats, what a family thinks about food. This
      can be both a good and bad thing. This setup means that many families
      understand a &#8220;woman&#8217;s role&#8221; as one which involves
      spending time feeding and looking after them, and whilst it&#8217;s great
      to be the nurturing one, the one who can make the AMAZING pie, the one who
      keeps the place feeling like a home. It&#8217;s less great to be that
      person
      <em
        >because you are female.<\/em> And that&#8217;s the problem.<\/p>\n
        <p>
          The kitchen is the centre of a lot of families and households. Control
          of the kitchen means control over a lot more than that. Women are,
          whether they realise it or not, at the very centre of what kinds of
          food we eat and hence the sort that is offered, produced and sold.
          Realistically, the entire industry of <a
          href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fast_moving_consumer_goods\">FMCG
          products<\/a> &#8211; and the potential for increasingly
          environmentally friendly products, fair trade products, and organic
          products &#8211; is supported by the habits of women when they go to
          the store.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          In short &#8211; women can make a huge amount of difference to the
          world by leveraging their role as consumer. And this is where the
          feminist bit comes in. It&#8217;s not about consigning the entire role
          of &#8220;homemaker&#8221; to the bin of 1950s retro parties and
          relief over how we&#8217;re not <a
          href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Betty_Draper\">Betty
          Draper<\/a>. It&#8217;s about using the history of women in the home,
          women cooks, our mums and grandmothers, to think about (and act upon)
          a new tradition of taking charge and getting on.<\/p>\n

          My gran taught me how to cook. She also taught me many other things
          about making my own way in the world, which included a damn good
          shortcrust pastry.<\/p>\n

            They&#8217;ve even helped us understand more about countries and
            cultures beyond the UK and Europe &#8211; food being an excellent
            and tasty way of enjoying a bit of intercultural sharing. In the
            70s, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.madhur-jaffrey.com\/\">Madhur
            Jaffrey&#8217;s<\/a> travel-diaries mixed recipes with vignettes on
            where the food was found, who made it and interesting titbits of
            stories on Indian culture. More recently, <a

          <p>
            Next up, we can look at women&#8217;s roles in the kitchen in
            connection with the economy. The recent waves of recession after
            recession have seen a rise in cost of living with a corresponding
            reactive change in shopping habits as women revolt every day against
            the high cost of food prices by <a
            href=\"http:\/\/business.scotsman.com\/consumerdebt\/Cheaper-food-in-the-baskets.6804877.jp\">changing
            where they buy things<\/a> and what is being cooked and eaten in the
            home. The fact that the cuts <a
            href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/2010\/10\/22\/making-laws-count-together\/\">fall
            more heavily<\/a> upon women, and that the burden of dealing with
            households with lower incomes also falls into the pockets of female
            aprons, has led many <a
            href=\"http:\/\/womenagainstthecuts.org\/\">women to become
            increasingly political<\/a>.<\/p>\n

                    I&#8217;m going to close by saying that I really believe
                    that teaching everyone to cook, to know where food comes
                    from and the value of properly sourced, sustainable food
                    products is part of the feminist movement. The power of the
                    kitchen is not something to be set aside in the belief that
                    we are letting down the sisterhood by being chained to the
                    oven. Instead, we can help make a much better world by
                    getting <span style=\"text-decoration:
