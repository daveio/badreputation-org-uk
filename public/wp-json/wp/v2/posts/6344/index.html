      >Welcome back to Rai, who kicked off our Gamer Diary <a

        As a new addition to BadRep I thought it\u2019d be a good idea to
        introduce myself a bit more thoroughly, seeing as I intend to keep
        popping up. I don\u2019t mean in the typical sense of &#8220;Hi, my
        name\u2019s Rai, I\u2019m 23 and I like&#8230;&#8221; because most of
        that isn\u2019t entirely pertinent. Instead I thought I\u2019d talk
        about gaming and me.<\/p>\n

        \/><\/a>I\u2019ve been playing computer games for well over 15 years
        already; I started with
        <strong
          >Wolfenstein<\/strong> and
          <strong
            >DOOM<\/strong> when I was eight years old and before that played
            puzzle games and other now-\u2018retro\u2019 games like
            <strong
              >Space Invaders<\/strong>or
              <strong
                >PacMan<\/strong>. Over the years my tastes haven\u2019t varied
                too much, merely widened to encompass other styles, such as RPG
                and strategy games. Admittedly, I&#8217;m still a die-hard PC
                gamer, but I also own an Xbox 360 for some console action and an
                old PSP that rarely gets used.<\/p>\n
                <p>
                  The games that I invariably come back to time after time
                  almost always have some element of the supernatural, sci-fi or
                  fantasy in them and more often than not are shooters, though I
                  have developed a healthy interest in \u2018sandbox\u2019 style
                  games like
                  <strong
                    >Assassin\u2019s Creed<\/strong> or
                    <strong
                      >Prototype<\/strong>. For your delectation and amusement
                      I&#8217;ve included a quick snap of a
                      <em
                        >few<\/em> of my boxed games (I have many, many more on
                        <a
                        href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/wvelkala\/games?tab=all\">Steam<\/a>
                        and a few Xbox 360 games elsewhere).<\/p>\n
                        <p>
                          Why am I telling you all this? So that I can ease
                          slowly into a conversation about gender perceptions
                          and stereotypes in gaming from my own experiences. Now
                          that you know I like shooting aliens and occasionally
                          wielding swords and casting magic spells, there is one
                          more thing you need to know about me before we
                          continue: I could be perceived by others to be, at
                          least ostensibly, female.<\/p>\n
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Normally, this fact is
                          <em
                            >utterly irrelevant<\/em> but unfortunately it
                            becomes relevant in the context of gaming and being
                            known as a gamer. Why is it relevant in these
                            circumstances? Because stereotypes are rampant, and
                            I have had more than my fair share of encounters
                            with them.<\/p>\n
                            <p>
                              An excellent example of this is when a very close
                              friend of mine, who had known me for years, was
                              watching me play an FPS game on the computer.
                              After I\u2019d had a good few headshots and
                              diligently eradicated the enemy, he declared,
                              \u201cYou\u2019re pretty good&#8230; for a
                              girl.\u201d Upon seeing my best \u2018I am not
                              impressed\u2019 look (a mix of anger and despair)
                              he back-pedalled and said, \u201cNo, not like
                              that&#8230; just that girls aren\u2019t
                              <em
                                >usually<\/em> good at shooting
                                things.\u201d<\/p>\n
                                <p>
                                  Needless to say, I remained rather irked, but
                                  in the interest of peace, love and friendship
                                  we decided to move on swiftly. So the problem
                                  I am trying to illustrate here is the
                                  assumption, which is ridiculously widespread,
                                  that if one is ostensibly female then one must
                                  play a certain type of game. Similarly, if one
                                  is ostensibly male then one must play a
                                  certain
                                  <em
                                    >other<\/em> type of game. Never the twain
                                    shall meet!<\/p>\n
                                    <p>
                                      In practice (and in the most polite
                                      phrasing possible) this is naught but a
                                      rather large, steamy pile of manure.
                                      However, the stereotypes remain. I admit I
                                      may be at the extreme end of the spectrum
                                      when I play games like
                                      <strong
                                        >F.E.A.R.<\/strong>,
                                        <strong

                                          <strong

                                            <strong
                                              >DOOM<\/strong>, etc, but there
                                              are plenty of female gamers who
                                              play other shooters, like the RPG
                                              shooter
                                              <strong

                                                example. Equally, there are male
                                                gamers who play things other
                                                than

                                                    don\u2019t involve killing

                                                      aren\u2019t smart enough).
