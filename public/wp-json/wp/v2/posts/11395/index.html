<p>
  This June just gone, I\u2019ve been having fun on a variety of games &#8211;
  but that also means I haven\u2019t finished any of them just yet.\u00a0 Plus
  I\u2019ve only had three weeks of the month to play before writing this as
  I\u2019m moving home, so I expect some disruption.\u00a0 Nevertheless, I can
  finally bring you comments on
  <strong
    >Assassin\u2019s Creed: Revelations<\/strong>
    <em
      >(over 6 months after release &#8211; soz),<\/em> alongside
      <strong
        >Bastion<\/strong> from the
        <strong
          >Humble Bundle V<\/strong>, which, by the way, ended up with over
          $5,000,000 raised.\u00a0 Also:
          <strong
            >Torchlight<\/strong> and some
            watching-over-my-partner\u2019s-shoulder of
            <strong
              >Max Payne 3<\/strong> (for PC).<\/p>\n
              <p>
                I\u2019ve also had a bit of a <a
                href=\"http:\/\/www.tf2.com\/\"><strong
                  >TF2<\/strong><\/a> revival this month, and that\u2019s been
                  fun, but what more can be said about TF2?\u00a0 There are no
                  female characters (yet), although there are plenty of female
                  gamers.\u00a0 I personally haven\u2019t seen much SexistFail
                  in chat but I know it does happen on some servers (you do,
                  however, get a
                  <em
                    >lot<\/em> of childish insults and obscene
                    \u2018sprays\u2019 on some servers).\u00a0 It\u2019s a fun,
                    team-based game that\u2019s F2P (Free2Play), and
                    <strong

                      further still.\u00a0 That\u2019s interesting, right?\u00a0

                          >Bastion<\/strong><\/a>!\u00a0 This is a very curious
                          indie title that offers a considerable amount of
                          play-time compared to other indie offerings.\u00a0
                          It&#8217;s described as \u201c<em
                            >\u2026an action role-playing experience that
                            redefines storytelling in games, with a reactive
                            narrator who marks your every
                            move<\/em>\u201d.\u00a0 I\u2019ve heard similar
                            claims before and ended up disappointed, but
                            <strong
                              >Bastion<\/strong> really delivers on this
                              concept.\u00a0 Admittedly, the narrator\u2019s
                              voice does get on my nerves but it really does
                              react to what you do.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure
                              there\u2019s an inventory of quips and comments
                              that are selected according to specific trigger
                              events in the game but it\u2019s still pretty
                              cool.<\/p>\n
                              <p>
                                The art is lovely and it isn\u2019t just the
                                simple damsel-in-distress format that I have
                                encountered in a lot of other indie titles
                                (<strong
                                  >LIMBO<\/strong>,
                                  <strong
                                    >Braid<\/strong>, for example), which is a
                                    nice change of pace.\u00a0 Although the main
                                    active characters are all male and the one
                                    female (so far) has been pretty passive,
                                    there\u2019s still a good bit of joy to be
                                    taken from this game.\u00a0 It\u2019s simple
                                    enough to grasp and you can make it harder
                                    in a variety of ways, so for gameplay and
                                    originality it gets a thumbs-up from
                                    me.\u00a0 Unfortunately, if you didn\u2019t
                                    get lucky and snap up the Humble Bundle,

                                            mention about

                                              and I bring this up because I also
                                              want to make a special note of
