      After September\u2019s reshuffle, Theresa May remains as Home Secretary, a
      role in which she has occasionally <a
      href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-politics-12296269\">talked a good
      game<\/a> but done <a
      href=\"http:\/\/brightgreenscotland.org\/index.php\/2012\/06\/why-theresa-mays-immigration-proposals-are-a-feminist-issue\/\">little<\/a>
      <a
      href=\"http:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/news\/uk\/politics\/theresa-may-scraps-power-to-ban-domestic-abusers-from-victims-homes-2042596.html\">materially<\/a>
      to endear herself to women. Maria Miller\u2019s appointment as Minister
      for Culture, Media and Sport, as well as Minister for Women and
      Equalities, got off to a flying start when an unexacting series of
      anti-equality accusations against her went viral; even if the list was
      badly and disingenuously worded, <a
      href=\"http:\/\/fullfact.org\/articles\/facebook_maria_miller_minister_equality_homophobia_racism-28089\">the
      facts behind it<\/a> still don\u2019t exactly fill one with confidence in
      her. The high-profile irritant Louise Mensch, meanwhile, has given up on a
      parliamentary career after serving just over two years of her term. So
      much for \u2018Tory feminism\u2019.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      The UK is currently ranked 57th <a
      href=\"http:\/\/www.ipu.org\/wmn-e\/classif.htm\">here<\/a>, and has never
      been spectacular at getting women into government. As of early 2012, women
      represented only 16% of Conservative MPs and 31% of Labour MPs \u2013 but
      what does the number of women in government mean?<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Gender parity is obviously not synonymous with strategic influence or
      decision-making power, and, particularly after <a
      href=\"www.badreputation.org.uk\/2012\/01\/10\/on-thatcher-icons-and-iron-ladies-rhian-jones\/\">Exhibit
      M<\/a>, it&#8217;s slightly preposterous to think that a particular
      demographic will vote or make policy according to gender rather than
      ideology. <\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      The current government itself has provided examples of this, with some of
      its most prominent and media-friendly female MPs \u2013 step forward
      Nadine Dorries \u2013 also pushing the harshest lines on reproductive or
      employment rights. All of which strengthens the argument for viewing and
      judging the actions of female politicians on an individual basis, rather
      than viewing them all as an undifferentiated flash of eye candy whose
      political presence is considered automatically progressive. This last
      trope reached its probable peak, as did so much bland but deeply damaging
      smuggery, under Tony Blair and his insipid cohort of \u2018Blair&#8217;s
      Babes\u2019. In France, this year&#8217;s slightly more optimistic victory
      for the Socialist Party under Francois Hollande has nevertheless drawn
      comparisons with New Labour&#8217;s use of women MPs as relatively
      powerless tokens of progressiveness:<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        In an article entitled \u201cThe irritating photo\u201d, Isabelle
        Germain asks why these highly qualified women are being treated like
        Hollande\u2019s trophies. Just like the \u2018Blair Babes\u2019,
        Hollande\u2019s female ministers have their own twee media nickname; the
        \u2018Hollandettes\u2019. Linguistically, the \u2018Hollandettes\u2019
        are to Hollande what \u2018Beliebers\u2019 are to the pop star Justin
        Beiber \u2013 relative to their male leader and their roles determined
        by his authority. \u2013 <a
        href=\"http:\/\/francefemmesfeminisme.wordpress.com\/2012\/05\/18\/blairs-babes-and-the-hollandettes-spot-the-difference\/\">Source<\/a>.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        Even for a place so historically rife with sniggering male privilege and
        suspended adolescence as the House of Commons, the language and
        attitudes recently faced by female MPs has been some of the most
        patronising for years \u2013 not least the current Prime Minister
        instructing Labour MP Angela Eagle to \u2018Calm down, dear\u2019 and
        not even bothering to acknowledge a question from the admittedly
        objectionable Nadine Dorries, instead dismissing her with the snide
        innuendo \u2018I realise the honourable lady is frustrated\u2019. Not
        that female parliamentarians should automatically be given an easy ride
        (hur hur), but neither should their opponents draw so instinctively and
        with quite so much entitled relish on lazy and reactionary stereotypes
        of hysteria and frustration as a means of avoiding the issues they wish
        to raise.<\/p>\n

      <p>
        Perhaps of a piece with the deeply retrograde, public school and
        debating club roots of the present government, we seem to be seeing a
        renewed emphasis on the idea of politics as an adversarial,
        point-scoring arena in which women are ill-equipped to spar. This kind
        of thing is part of what
        <strong
          >The Thick Of It<\/strong> subverts and satirises so well. For all the
          show\u2019s scattergun profanity, and the \u2018violent sexual
          imagery\u2019 and Freudian nightmares in its characters\u2019 verbal
          volleys, the majority of humour in
          <strong
            >The Thick Of It<\/strong>is derived not from the successful
            exercise of power but from impotence and frustration.<\/p>\n
            <p>
              In addition, <a href=\"http:\/\/calitreview.com\/30599\">as Jem
              Bloomfield has noted elsewhere<\/a>, there\u2019s the extent to
              which the Lib-Dem avatars\u2019 try-hard laddishness and awkward
              stabs at dick-swinging plays into their dislikeability \u2013
              Roger Allam\u2019s shire-tastic Peter Mannion MP, for all his
              downtrodden One Nation Tory-out-of-time woes, manages to exude
              more patrician authority than either of them. Overtly chauvinist
              or patronising attitudes are the preserve of characters, like the
              awkwardly overfamiliar Steve Fleming, whom the viewer is invited
              to regard with contempt.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              Like
              <strong
                >The League of Gentlemen<\/strong> before it,
                <strong
                  >The Thick Of It<\/strong>\u2019s female grotesques are no
                  less venal or useless or dim or inane than their male
                  counterparts. Besides giving as good as they get, the
                  show&#8217;s women, in the current series in particular, tend
                  to crop up as self-possessed and efficient centres of
                  competence within a given episode\u2019s crisis and
                  clusterfuck, whether it&#8217;s Terri\u2019s brisk and
                  matronly, almost instinctive civil servant\u2019s
                  professionalism, or Emma\u2019s ruthless and steely slither up
                  her party\u2019s ladder of opportunity.<\/p>\n
                  <p>
                    The exception to this is of course Rebecca Front&#8217;s
                    portrayal of the well-meaning but hapless Nicola Murray MP,
                    first introduced as a Minister put out to grass and now
                    floundering as Leader of the Opposition. Chronically lacking
                    in self-belief, ideas or ideology, beset by power-hungry
                    underlings and colleagues, and unsupported by her offscreen
                    husband, Murray is almost painfully unsuited for the
                    environment in which she finds herself having to operate
                    \u2013 but so, crucially, is Peter Mannion, and so was
                    Murray\u2019s forerunner, the spectacularly hangdog Hugh
                    Abbott.<\/p>\n

                    She has the odd display of offhand feminist snark (\u2018I
                    love the division of labour in here \u2013 how the women do

                    tragedy of several characters that they exist in a political
                    and media world in which those who flourish are flavourless
                    post-Blair clones like the largely unseen Dan Miller.<\/p>\n

                      the predominance of women in Plaid Cymru\u2019s leadership
                      is likely to have. Leanne Woods, Plaid&#8217;s first
                      female leader, is refreshing enough for her unabashed
                      socialist and republican ideals \u2013 although these
                      principles are very much not common to the whole

                        Woods has attracted the always-dubious label of
