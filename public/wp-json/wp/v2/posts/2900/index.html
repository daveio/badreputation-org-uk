      Twitter hashtags make conversations and exchanges that would previously
      have been invisible to anyone not involved in them available to everyone.
      You can stick your head out of your own online bubble and peer into
      someone else\u2019s. If you listen in to a conversation on a bus or in a
      bar you\u2019ll often get a similar effect, and if you ever share a train
      carriage with a stag party you may well overhear some of the same
      sentiments.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a lot of possibilities and interesting conversations growing out
      of this (here\u2019s a good <a
      href=\"http:\/\/mashable.com\/2010\/10\/14\/twitter-cross-cultural\/\">Mashable
      post<\/a> about cross-cultural conversations) but it can be uncomfortable
      having a front row seat for the social reproduction of gender stereotypes
      in real time.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <h3>
      Tweeting gender<\/h3>\n
      <p>
        [Apologies to any gender theorists out there for this next bit, in which
        I will be oversimplifying some complex ideas.]<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        [Oh and just to be clear, when I&#8217;m talking about men and women I
        don&#8217;t mean
        <em
          >all<\/em> men or<em>
            all<\/em> women, and I know those categories are far more fluid than
            our friends the hashtaggers would like to admit.]<\/p>\n
            <p>
              Part of the Great Promise of the internet was that in the gap
              between your avatar and your fingertips on the keyboard all kinds
              of subversive genderfuck fun was to be had. And it is being had
              (hooray!), but there\u2019s a tangible disappointment in some
              areas that the web is used as much to police and reinforce
              gendered ideas of appropriate behaviour as it is to undermine
              them. Social networks, it turns out, are simply another arena in
              which to enact and consolidate gender identity. Like the bus, like
              the pub.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              And a big part of successfully Being A Man or Being A Woman is
              policing the behaviour of others. By laying down the rules
              you\u2019re letting everyone know you understand them. In fact
              you\u2019re an expert. By calling out someone else on their
              inappropriate behaviour (for example, women that are
              \u2018loud\u2019 &#8211; how unfeminine!) you\u2019re picking up
              gender points for yourself. And appropriate gender behaviour
              points <a

            <p>
              You can see this in action in the huge numbers of women
              participating in sexist hashtags and imparting helpful advice to
              their own gender:<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>#rulesforgirls stoppp being so easyyyy!<\/p>\n</p>

              <p>
                Thanks for that. Now I&#8217;m all set. In another recent
                hashtag, #youneedanewboyfriend, large numbers of male and female
                Twitter users took the opportunity to remind everyone that male
                femininity = gay! Which as we all know = very bad indeed:<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <p>
                  \nyour man has more clothes with different shades of pink than

                </p>
                <p>
                  If your man turns down sex from you,
                  #youneedanewboyfriend<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>
                  It&#8217;s not just about putting women in their place,
                  it&#8217;s about keeping men in line as well. If you can do
                  both that makes you the Manliest Man of all, and king of all
                  you survey. The tweets I quoted in the first post are part of
                  this process. On the one hand encouraging traditionally
                  feminine behaviours, and on the other boosting the masculinity
                  points of the men tweeting, and asserting their dominance and
                  entitlement (consider yourself lucky if you missed #itaintrape
                  \u2013 that one was Not Nice).<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  What I think is happening here is that a large number of
                  people are using a new medium to do exactly what an even
                  larger number of people have already been doing for centuries,
                  millennia, even. What\u2019s different is that the isolated
                  conversations are being collected and shared on a global
                  platform.<\/p>\n

                    The flagrant misogyny of most of these trending topic
                    hashtag tweets makes me furiously angry. But I don&#8217;t
                    find them shocking. I think Germaine Greer is wrong on lots
                    of things but right on this one: \u201cWomen have very
                    little idea of how much men hate them.\u201d Well, now we
                    have a handy index in our Twitter sidebar. The scale of the
                    problem is intimidating, I agree, but being shocked
                    isn\u2019t going to help.<\/p>\n
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The good news is we don&#8217;t need to start a cultural
                    revolution from scratch. There\u2019s some excellent work
                    already going on: for example, <a
                    href=\"http:\/\/www.womankind.org.uk\/uk-schools.html\">Womankind<\/a>
                    and <a
                    href=\"http:\/\/www.pinkstinks.co.uk\/\">PinkStinks<\/a> are
                    challenging misogyny and sexist attitudes among young people
                    (who seem like the obvious group to start with, to my
                    mind).<\/p>\n
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There are also lots of truly wonderful online projects that
                    are trying to break down some of these poisonous stereotypes
                    and ideas. BadRep is one, of course ;-) .\u00a0 But another
                    of my favourites is <a
                    href=\"http:\/\/genderfork.com\/\">Genderfork<\/a> \u2013
                    follow them on Twitter for the perfect antidote to all this
                    #rulesforgirls\/boys crap.<\/p>\n
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What else can we do? Mocking the hashtags is fun. Hijacking
                    them is fun too. It might not overthrow the sexist idiot
                    regime, but if it makes just one person stop and think then
                    it&#8217;s surely worth it. Another blogger on the topic of
                    hashtags suggested getting some feminist hashtags
                    circulating. Suggestions included #feminist and
                    #ilovemybody. That&#8217;d be nice for other feminists, but
                    I can\u2019t see how they\u2019d have very wide appeal,
                    particularly because they don\u2019t invite people to
                    personalise them.<\/p>\n
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So I\u2019m going to end with a challenge:

                      >can we come up with a funny, pro-feminist \/ genderfuck
