  Poor old millionaire superstar
  <strong
    >Adele<\/strong>, eh? No sooner has the dust settled on the furore over her
    <a
    href=\"http:\/\/politicalscrapbook.net\/2011\/05\/adele-tax-brit-school\/\">objections<\/a>
    to being a higher-rate taxpayer, than she gets thrown into the vanguard of
    another of those putative Real Women in Music revolutions. A mere three
    years after she started out, and after just seventeen weeks of her second
    album at Number One, it appears to have suddenly dawned on Richard Russell
    that Adele exemplifies <a
    href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/music\/2011\/may\/29\/adele-change-women-music-business\">all
    that\u2019s healthy and hopeful<\/a> in the otherwise dire and overheated
    state of contemporary pop.<\/p>\n
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &#8220;The whole message with [Adele] is that it&#8217;s just music,
        it&#8217;s just really good music,&#8221; said Russell. &#8220;There is
        nothing else. There are no gimmicks, no selling of sexuality. I think in
        the American market, particularly, they have come to the conclusion that
        is what you have to do.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n

        \/><\/a>The main reason why Russell\u2019s claims about Adele should be
        regarded with scepticism is that Russell is the head of Adele\u2019s
        record label. Even leaving aside such vested interests, his argument
        that she represents some kind of paradigm shift has been ably
        deconstructed <a

        The
        <strong
          >Guardian <\/strong>article linked to above has a few frustrating
          facets of its own. I\u2019m not sure why Rihanna\u2019s
          &#8216;S&amp;M&#8217; should be hoicked in to illustrate
          Russell\u2019s point: there\u2019s a difference between having a
          sexualised image \u2013 usually, when it&#8217;s the subject of
          criticism, one that\u2019s been externally imposed on an artist \u2013
          and singing about sex and sexuality. Especially when
          &#8216;S&amp;M&#8217; is a more complex song than that framework
          allows for &#8211; arguably one in which Rihanna presents
          non-mainstream sexuality in terms of female agency. Finally, the idea
          of good-girl, sexless Adele vs bad-girl, sexualised Rihanna is a false
          dichotomy with problems in abundance.<\/p>\n
          <p>
            Adele\u2019s own image is hardly free of contrivance, harking back
            as it does to the blue-eyed soul divas of the 1960s &#8211; classily
            sexualised, perhaps, but sexualised nonetheless. In her chosen brand
            of popular music, a degree of sex in your self-presentation is, as
            Russell correctly identifies, inextricably linked to commercial
            success. It\u2019s even arguable, unfortunately, that it\u2019s
            Adele\u2019s very distance from the currently acceptable aesthetic
            norms of her genre that has necessitated she be marketed with a
            different, &#8216;desexualised&#8217; focus. Had Adele possessed her
            own voice but the body of, oh, let&#8217;s say Katy Perry, would her
            image have been sexed-up business as usual?<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            Russell is taking issue, of course, not with the marketing and
            self-presentation of all women in music, but with a particular
            branch of commercial pop, and the marketing therein of female
            artists by predominantly male management, which was ever thus. If
            his comments do kickstart a new way of measuring the money-making
            potential of women in music, then great, but it&#8217;s going to be
            an uphill struggle in view of the constant and increasing pressures
            on female performers &#8211; as well as male &#8211; to conform to a
            blandly beautiful industry standard.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            Is Adele&#8217;s refusal to bow to that standard, as Russell claims,
            as radical today as the Prodigy were in the early 1990s? Let\u2019s
            face it, mainstream acts are so limp and colourless right now, and
            popular culture so devoid of ideas, experiments and imagination,
            that yeah, it probably is. Never mind that the Prodigy were highly
            politicised and engaged with a wider oppositional culture, while
            Adele is outspoken in bemoaning her tax burden.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            While no one can begrudge Adele her success, or deny that it&#8217;s
            refreshing to witness, the fact that she can be said to occupy a
            radical position is more an indictment of contemporary music than it
            is a compliment to her. The most positive thing about
            Russell&#8217;s remarks is the opportunity they offer to reiterate a
            greater truth: that commercial profit-driven pap purely designed to
            generate a profit is more than socio-culturally damaging for women,
            it\u2019s dull.<\/p>\n
