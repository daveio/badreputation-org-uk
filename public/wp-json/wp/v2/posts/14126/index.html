  Early December. The leaves have fallen, the sky has darkened. Rain lashes the
  windows. Doors yawn open before you; blackness whispers chill secrets into
  your hair, and your worst nightmares take shape &#8216;twixt the smoky trees,
  taunting, menacing. Waiting.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  Basically, at the time of writing it was the month with Hallowe&#8217;en in
  it, and I hate to waste a perfectly good theme. So without further ado, allow
  me to welcome you to
  <strong
    >Hopeless Reimantic Presents<\/strong>! In this column I&#8217;ll be going
    in-depth into the works of specific authors who are in &#8211; or cross over
    into &#8211; the romance genre. In the spirit of the season, I thought
    we&#8217;d take a look at the stuff of nightmares: let&#8217;s talk about
    Laurell K. Hamilton. More specifically, let&#8217;s talk about
    <strong
      >Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter<\/strong>, one of the weirdest and most
      controversial series I&#8217;ve ever interacted with.<\/p>\n<div

        First of all, a slightly complicated preface. Before I ever picked up an
        Anita Blake book I knew quite a lot about them, and while I&#8217;d like
        to stress that I&#8217;m here to talk about the
        <em
          ><\/em>books and
          <em
            >not<\/em> Ms Hamilton herself I feel like I&#8217;ll be remiss if I
            don&#8217;t at least give a quick summary of some common
            controversies surrounding the series and its author.<\/p>\n
            <p>
              I first became aware of Laurell K. Hamilton via Anne Rice. Well,
              not Anne Rice herself, but <a
              href=\"http:\/\/www.journalfen.net\/community\/fandom_wank\/515245.html?nc=911\"

              which I arrived at a couple of years after the fact and
              consequently saw linked to&#8230;Laurell K. Hamilton&#8217;s <a
              href=\"http:\/\/eragon-sporkings.wikispaces.com\/Hamiltons_Response_To_Negative_Readers\"
              target=\"_blank\">similarly poor handling of criticism<\/a> (link
              to a Wikispace article, as the original blog post has
              vanished).<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              Hamilton isn&#8217;t quite as vitriolic in her I Can&#8217;t
              Believe Not Everyone Likes My Book-ness, but she&#8217;s still
              pretty irritatingly condescending, although I do agree with her
              that if someone&#8217;s taking their book up to you so that you
              can sign it, then opening with &#8220;I hated this one and what
              you&#8217;ve done with the series&#8221; is kind of poor
              form.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              She&#8217;s since made a name for herself on Twitter for calling
              her critics <a

              a nice catalogue of her various posts, blogs and misdemeanours,
              and I&#8217;ve been on it all day, which might explain why my
              brain is starting to feel too heavy for my skull.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              As a lot of you probably aren&#8217;t familiar with what makes the
              Anita Blake series so divisive in the first place, I&#8217;ll give
              you a quick, neutral description to start us off (don&#8217;t
              worry, we&#8217;ll get to the incoherent ranting later). The
              <strong
                >Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter<\/strong> series started out as a
                kind of monster-of-the-week dealio, with some romance in it but
                not a huge deal. The romantic &#8211; and sexual &#8211; content
                of the books got a lot more page time as the series went on, and
                the tenth book in the series,
                <strong
                  >Narcissus In Chains<\/strong>, saw a metaphysical event turn
                  Anita Blake into a succubus who needs sex to survive.<\/p>\n
                  <p>
                    Subsequent books are arguably more &#8220;paranormal
                    erotica&#8221; than anything else, and the last time I
                    checked in with Ms Blake she was in a polyamorous
                    relationship with five guys and happy as a clam. This, and
                    the fact that a lot of the events of Anita Blake&#8217;s
                    love life seem to mirror the author&#8217;s, have led to
                    accusations that Laurell K. Hamilton is using Anita to brag
                    about how much sex she&#8217;s having, and have turned a lot
                    of readers off the series.<\/p>\n
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The upshot of all this is that this time three months ago,
                    your intrepid romance novel enthusiast knew
                    <em
                      >of<\/em> Laurell K. Hamilton and had formed a pretty
                      strong impression of the
                      <strong
                        >Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter<\/strong> books &#8211; but
                        had never actually picked one up. So when the call came
                        around for horror-themed posts for autumn and winter,
                        and I decided to take them on, I was&#8230;nervous, but
                        excited. Here was a series with a strong female lead
                        which had lost popularity as the erotic content had
                        upped and the quality of the writing had deteriorated
                        &#8211; the stuff of feminist bad-porn-lovers&#8217;
                        wildest dreams, right?<\/p>\n
                        <p>
                          All that given due consideration, I wanted to approach
                          the series with an open mind, but I didn&#8217;t want
                          to actually buy any of the books because a) this
                          isn&#8217;t somebody I want to give money to and b)
                          there are approximately bleventeen of the damned
                          things and I don&#8217;t have a job. I put out a call
                          on my social medias for donations to the cause.<\/p>\n
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Three weeks later, I had
                          <em
                            >seventeen Laurell K. Hamilton books<\/em>. And with
                            various deadlines coming up? I had a week to read
                            them in.<\/p>\n
                            <p>
                              Some would have panicked. Some would have
                              faltered. Some would have done several noisy
                              circuits of the living room, sobbing about the
                              hilarious injustice of life. Some would have said,
                              &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s okay, I don&#8217;t have
                              to read all of these, I&#8217;m not
                              <em
                                >that<\/em> much of a masochist&#8221;, picked
                                out a selection, and called it a day.<\/p>\n
                                <p>
                                  I did all of these things except the last one.
                                  Here&#8217;s how I got on. The following are

                                          17th, so I guess we&#8217;ll find out

                                          This is going to be a difficult bit of
                                          analysis to write, because &#8211;
                                          well, I read seventeen books, you
                                          guys. I&#8217;m having to be extremely
                                          choosy about which books I quote and
                                          why. Maybe I&#8217;ll upload a list of
                                          Supplementary Supportive Material,
                                          but, um, I wouldn&#8217;t count on

                                          Broadly speaking, dear readers,
                                          here&#8217;s the thing:
                                          <em
                                            >I didn&#8217;t hate these books the

                                            <p>
                                              Look, fourteen-year-old me assumed
                                              I&#8217;d hate these books because
                                              they were a self-insert
                                              Mary-Sue-type series that ended
                                              with the main character having far
                                              too much ridiculously improbable
                                              sex and being the best at
                                              everything. Fourteen-year-old me
                                              was also scared of non-monogamy,
                                              kind of selective in her feminism
                                              and a lot more judgmental.
                                              Fourteen-year-old me would
                                              probably have written this bit of
                                              the article in a far more
                                              entertainingly vitriolic
                                              manner.<\/p>\n

                                              Unfortunately, you&#8217;re stuck
                                              with twenty-three-year-old me, and
                                              twenty-three-year-old me
                                              doesn&#8217;t have a problem with
                                              any of these things on principle.
                                              Look, okay, self-insert Mary-Sues
                                              aren&#8217;t my cup of tea, and I
                                              can see why a sharp rise (hurr) in
                                              sexual content in a series which
                                              basically had no sexual content at
                                              all for the first four books might
                                              turn readers off &#8211; but those
                                              two facts don&#8217;t make either
