<p>
  In 1994 I was 12. I was also spending most of my time in the late 70s. Surely
  the only punk in my small Cornish town, I&#8217;d got a short back and sides,
  a pair of docs and a blazer prickling with safety pins. I&#8217;d got my
  Pistols, Clash, Ramones, Buzzcocks, Undertones. And I wanted to tear
  everything to pieces. I was all set.<\/p>\n

<p>
  Then one day while rifling through my parents&#8217; (excellent, though I

        When I put the record on it was like nothing I&#8217;d heard before. It
        was as if
        <strong
          >The Slits<\/strong> had stolen their beats from the gaps in other
          peoples&#8217; songs. The rhythms seemed alien but I felt something
          click into place &#8211; next time I had the bus fare to get to Truro
          I found and bought the magnificent
          <em
            >Cut<\/em> and fell in love. Here was something truly radical, with
            the chaos and creative destruction that I loved in punk but with
            irony and humour and WOMEN.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_359\"

              The Slits were true musical innovators, drawing as much from
              reggae and dub as from the punk scene. They were funny,
              aggressive, embarrassing, chaotic, and sexual without trying to be
              sexy. From the name of the band onwards they played with gender
              and with ideas of what women were and were meant to be.<\/p>\n

              <strong
                >Ari Up<\/strong> (aka InnoDBnna Forster) died yesterday aged
                48. She was only 14 when she formed The Slits with drummer
                Palmolive (anyone else feel kinda old? Are you even
                <em
                  >allowed<\/em> to form a punk band after you\u2019re 20?) and
                  was still gigging this year. Her music means a lot to me and
                  to many others, and the importance of The Slits for women in
                  punk and, well, most alternative music really is difficult to
                  convey. They cracked the mould.<\/p>\n
