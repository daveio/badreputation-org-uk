    The \u201cRock the Red Pump\u201d campaign is our annual initiative to
    commemorate National Women and Girls HIV\/AIDS Awareness Day. It has become
    our biggest initiative, and is what started The Red Pump Project. Since
    2009, when we had over 100 bloggers \u201cRock the Red Pump,\u201d we have
    started the \u201cRock the Red Pump \u2013 500 in 50\u201d to get 500 blogs
    to participate in the 50 days leading up to NWGHAAD.<\/p>\n
  </p>
  <p>
    The blog network we have is unique in that they are women who acknowledge
    the severity of the issue and understand the importance of conversation. The
    power and influence of these bloggers has driven The Red Pump Project to
    where it is today.<\/p>\n

        Hey now, I thought. Why isn&#8217;t this more well-known? Why
        didn&#8217;t I know about this day? I only know about World AIDS Day.
        Maybe it
        <em
          >is<\/em> more widely known, but only in the US? I hear about lots of
          other US-y things with a tedious regularity from Black Friday<sup

              Project isn&#8217;t UK-based, I thought it was way cool.<\/p>\n
              <p>
                If you&#8217;re US-based (and maybe even if you&#8217;re not;
                does it matter?) you can sign your blog up and download a Red
                Pump badge. There are <a
                href=\"http:\/\/www.theredpumpproject.org\/hivaids-and-women\/\">excellent
                reasons to get involved here<\/a>. One reason I would add: I
                believe, with a strength that leads me to shout unbecomingly in
                pubs, that HIV awareness campaigns should always be designed and
                conducted in a way that is inclusive and above all
                non-stigmatising of people living with HIV. The <a
                href=\"http:\/\/www.thebody.com\/content\/art61152.html\">Hitler
                campaign?<\/a> The <a
                href=\"http:\/\/girllikeme.org\/2011\/03\/09\/taking-away-stigma-i-am-not-an-ugly-scorpion-which-adds-to-the-stigma\/\">Scorpion
                campaign?<\/a> Ugh. It doesn&#8217;t help if you raise awareness
                of HIV transmission risks by presenting HIV positive people as
                dangerous monsters. It leads to more concealment, less
                disclosure, less openness generally about HIV, and people being
                actively ostracised and in many cases places in actual physical
                danger. It&#8217;s disgusting. I could rant a while about stigma
                and the vicious circle of ignorance and erasure it feeds. Or,
                y&#8217;know, <a
                href=\"http:\/\/www.thebody.com\/content\/46169\/hiv-aids-blog-central.html?ic=3001\">go
                read The Body<\/a>. Actually, that&#8217;s a better idea. Do
                that instead. Preferable campaigns in my book: examples such as
                <a
                href=\"http:\/\/www.hivaware.org.uk\/act-aware\/support-campaign.php\">Act
                Aware<\/a>, which <a
                href=\"http:\/\/www.hivaware.org.uk\/be-aware\/real-stories.php\">actually
                engages with the concept of stigma<\/a>, or <a
                href=\"http:\/\/www.tht.org.uk\/howyoucanhelpus\/worldaidsday\/\">THT&#8217;s
                Stand Up, Stand Out<\/a>.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                So, yeah: I get very excited when I see a well-designed
                awareness project. On a broader political level I think there
                are limits to the efficacy of consumerism-inspired charity
                initiatives in the West &#8211; <a
                href=\"http:\/\/www.joinred.com\/red\"><strong
                  >(RED)<\/strong><\/a>, for example, relies not solely on
                  donations but on people shopping for expensive products and in
                  some cases wearing their awareness as a fashion item, which
                  only goes so far. (RED)&#8217;s &#8216;use global capitalism
                  for good&#8217; approach was groundbreaking to a point, but
                  the level to which large sections of its site will simply
                  redirect you to the Converse store can be quite grating. Its
                  campaigning focus is primarily on funding initiatives in
                  subsaharan Africa, which is great &#8211; but not the whole
                  story.<\/p>\n
                  <p>
                    However, the Red Pump Project, unlike (RED), is a grassroots
                    initiative that has taken off in the US, with an emphasis on
                    women and women of colour which I can only applaud. I like
                    that the project takes elements of the (RED) approach and
                    focuses less on the idea that &#8220;luxury goods over here
                    will generate aid over
                    <em
                      >there<\/em>&#8221; and more on, say, testing a thousand
                      people in an inner city community. I like that the graphic
                      &#8211; which has trainers on it too! &#8211; places
                      non-white wearers of the pumps front and centre and in the
                      majority. It makes a nice change. Rae Lewis-Thornton, who
                      <a
                      href=\"http:\/\/www.raelewisthornton.com\/2012\/02\/problem-of-stigma.html\">speaks
                      eloquently about stigma here<\/a>, has also endorsed it.
                      While fighting stigma is an implicit rather than explicit
                      aim in the approach the project has taken, they are <a
                      href=\"http:\/\/www.theredpumpproject.org\/2011\/09\/hiv-criminalization-what-do-you-know\/\">talking
                      about<\/a> the issues, and via their blog badge campaign,
                      helping make sure anyone can get involved, rather than
                      those who shop for luxury goods. Most of all,
                      they&#8217;re effectively marketing a breakout in HIV
                      activism from simply focussing on World AIDS Day in
                      December, instead broadening the approach to include
                      dedicated action throughout the year on behalf of women
                      and girls (March 10), Black HIV\/AIDS Awareness Day
                      (February 7) and so on.<\/p>\n
