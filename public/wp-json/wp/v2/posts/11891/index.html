        It\u2019s difficult not to take <a
        href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=E5xd0x9ThGM\">this book<\/a> as
        something of a betrayal. Not of principles or community, but of me
        personally, and the fact that I\u2019ve always admired P.D. James as
        someone who really understood Jane Austen. (By which I mean, agreed with
        me. Naturally.) When I was an undergraduate I went to see P.D. James
        speak about detective fiction, and she said one of the most brilliant
        things I have ever heard anyone say about literature. She declared
        calmly that Austen\u2019s
        <strong
          >Emma<\/strong> was the most perfect detective novel in the English
          language. It gave the reader all the information, she argued, in a
          perfectly fair way and just let them come to exactly the wrong
          conclusion for themselves. At the twist, you can look back and see
          where you went wrong, and how obvious the answer was if you\u2019d
          only thought it through. And then you can read the novel again,
          enjoying your awareness of the double tracks the story moves along
          \u2013 knowing about the other story half-submerged in the surface
          narrative, and switching your attention between them when they come
          into contact.<\/p>\n
          <p>
            I loved this statement so much because it showed a respect for
            Austen as an artist, and a recognition that her works are
            deliberately crafted and not simply cleverly observed portraits from
            life or timeless insights into human nature. They\u2019re literary
            artefacts with their own integrity and internal structures,
            something which often gets missed by both detractors and
            enthusiasts. The former castigate her for not including economics,
            the Napoleonic Wars or shifting models of gender relations, because
            no one ever stands up in an Austen novel and tells everyone how
            worried they are about economics, the Napoleonic Wars or shifting
            models of gender relations. This is treating her like a newspaper,
            not a novelist, as if it was Austen\u2019s duty to set down the
            events of the day in order of importance, and by not explicitly
            tackling the aftermath of the 1789 revolution she has relegated
            herself to the Lifestyle supplement. <\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to see the economics and politics in the novels, you have
            to first take them seriously as works of art whose stories and
            shapes have some sort of weight, not naive diary columns to be
            discarded if they don\u2019t trumpet their opinions on current
            affairs. At which point you notice that the legal arrangements which
            tie up Mr Bennett\u2019s estate in
            <strong
              >Pride and Prejudice<\/strong> prevent his daughters from
              inheriting it, meaning that their survival is dependent upon
              marrying relatively soon, particularly as the eligible young
              officers of the militia may be posted to another camp at any time.
              The entire Lydia-Wickham subplot takes place at the intersection
              between the legal instruments of primogeniture and the troop
              movements of the Napoleonic Campaigns. But we can only see this if
              we stop reading the novels as a transparent window onto the period
              they were written in, and respect them as novels whose internal
              structures give them meaning.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_11893\"

              <p>
                Exactly the same mistake is made in the opposite direction, I
                think, by Austen enthusiasts and the outlets of the
                Dating-Industrial-Complex.
                <strong

                      >The Jane Austen Guide to Living Happily Ever
                      After<\/strong><\/a> and all the rest seem to assume that
                      the value of these novels about courtship in the Regency
                      lies in how similar they might be to courtship in the
                      second Elizabethan era. The blurb of one suggests that
                      \u201cwe might have just lost touch with the fundamental
                      rules\u201d of dating, and offers \u201cthe only
                      relationship guide based on stories that really have stood
                      the test of time&#8230;full of concrete advice and wise
                      strategies that illustrate how honesty, self-awareness and
                      forthrightness do win the right man in the end and weed
                      out the losers, playboys and toxic flirts.\u201d For this
                      attitude, Austen was the Monet of prose fiction \u2013
                      only an eye, but my God, what an eye. The novels can offer
                      us nothing but a meticulous copy of reality, which we can
                      superimpose over our own lives and shuffle around the
                      pieces so they match. It lacks a sense that the works
                      might not be porous and amorphous, that we can\u2019t
                      simply dip in and haul up a ladle full of
                      \u201cAusten\u201d, but might have to investigate where
                      that particular ladleful came from and what relation it
                      bore to the bucketful around it. For the dating guides,
                      the stories lack individual integrity and shape, they can
                      just be copied and printed across any surface like a Cath
                      Kidston pattern.<\/p>\n
                      <p>
                        Both attitudes are obviously, as <a
                        href=\"http:\/\/isthisfeminist.tumblr.com\/\">that
                        Tumblr<\/a> would say, PROBLEMATIC. The first tends to
                        deny that women writers writing about women\u2019s lives
                        can have any significance beyond their literal content.
                        It\u2019s the attitude that provides us with a
                        women\u2019s supplement in newspapers because everything
                        else in the paper is assumed to pertain to men. It
                        reinforces the supposed distinction between a private
                        female sphere, in which dating and clothes are the
                        ruling topics, and a male public sphere where politics
                        and economics takes place. The second underpins the
                        male\/female spheres in a slightly different way,
                        encouraging us to think that one of the great female
                        writers is mostly interesting because of what she can
                        tell us about Catching A Man. It takes Austen\u2019s
                        insights into the inequalities of social life and the
                        power imbalances between the genders, and calcifies
                        those inequalities as the fundamental \u201crules\u201d
                        of dating. More generally, the lack of concern for the
                        specific form of the works seem to risk playing into a
                        long-standing tradition in Western thinking to associate
                        men with \u201cform\u201d and women with
                        \u201ccontent\u201d. I may be over-reading that last
                        point, but the line from Plato to Augustine to critiques
                        of women\u2019s fiction as interchangeable
                        \u201cslush\u201d provides a definite context for
                        thinking about attitudes to Austen which assume her
                        writing is an undifferentiated and unstructured
                        mass.<\/p>\n
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        P.D. James seemed to be standing out against both these
                        approaches, insisting that books like
                        <strong
                          >Emma<\/strong> or
                          <strong
                            >Sense and Sensibility<\/strong> deserved respect as
                            consciously crafted artefacts, whose meanings
                            couldn\u2019t be reduced to their surface in either
                            direction. Along with that came a respect for the
                            distinction between \u201cJane Austen\u2019s
                            world\u201d and the books which Austen wrote \u2013
                            that the novels were neither a photographic copy of
                            Regency life, not were they series of episodes in a
                            world-building project which could be placed
                            end-to-end to produce a fictional universe across
                            which characters could wander. On the contrary, each
                            one had its own concerns and perspective. <\/p>\n
                            <p>
                              Or so I thought. When she wrote <a
                              href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/Death-Comes-Pemberley-Baroness-James\/dp\/0571283578\"><strong
                                >Death Comes To Pemberley<\/strong><\/a> it
                                seemed that James had displayed the same
                                attitude as the dating guides and the Austen
                                pastiche industry: that her novels could be
                                regarded as creating \u201cAustenworld\u201d,
                                which anyone could stroll in and out of at will.
                                Slightly ironically, it was her comments about
                                <strong
                                  >Emma<\/strong> as the most perfect detective
                                  novel in the language which made me think that
                                  writing an actual detective novel set in
                                  Pemberley demonstrated a cavalier disdain for
                                  the integrity and form of
