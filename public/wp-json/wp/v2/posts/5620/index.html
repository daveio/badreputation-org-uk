                    and folklore?<\/strong><\/p>\n
                    <p>
                      &#8220;Robert Curley at Atomic Diner comics pitched the
                      core idea of
                      <strong
                        >R\u00f3is\u00edn Dubh<\/strong> to me and told me about
                        the existing myth around Abhartach. I did what I always
                        do: research. I thought a great deal about the time
                        period, the story of Abhartach, R\u00f3is\u00edn herself
                        and her situation.<\/p>\n
                        <p>
                          For me, I need to find what I think of a &#8216;mythic
                          resonance&#8217; in a story that I&#8217;m trying to
                          create. Making a character swing a sword and lop off a
                          head is easy: making a story with horror and fantasy
                          elements feel like it could possibly be real requires
                          that it resemble mythology itself.<\/p>\n
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          So, I went back to my books on Irish mythology &#8211;
                          of which I have many &#8211; and kept reading until
                          elements connected with what I already had in my head
                          about the story. I added a few Irish gods into the
                          mix, a companion character and a couple of magical
                          items. I widened the canvas. And I gave
                          R\u00f3is\u00edn a very painful thing to do, which
                          happens in issue 2 and is something that will haunt
                          her forever. <\/p>\n
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Equally, I thought a lot about Abhartach. I
                          don&#8217;t like simplistic villains. I added to his
                          backstory and made him into a person who does
                          unpleasant things, but who has motivations and reasons
                          for his view of the world. Thankfully, Rob was very
                          receptive to me bringing all this to the characters
                          and the story!<\/p>\n
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          I&#8217;ve been reading mythological stories from all
                          cultures since childhood. One story that holds a lot
                          of fascination for me is &#8216;the descent into the
                          underworld&#8217;. There is a variation on that in
                          issue 1 of
                          <strong
                            >R\u00f3is\u00edn Dubh<\/strong> &#8211; though
                            I&#8217;m not always aware of every element like
                            this that I&#8217;m tapping into when I write the
                            story. Sometimes it doesn&#8217;t become obvious
                            until later.<\/p>\n
                            <p>
                              Ultimately, when writing I try to feed my
                              subconscious to stuffing point with lots of
                              influences and then allow it to serve me up
                              suggestions as I&#8217;m going on. I trust it to
                              give me the right element at the right time. Then,
                              some time afterwards, I marvel at how it all came
                              together. That&#8217;s when it&#8217;s really
                              doing its job.<\/p>\n
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              But I have days when it gives me nothing and I
                              soldier on anyway.&#8221;<\/p>\n

                                >Creating a comic book in this way, with a
                                separate writer and artist, is a collaborative
                                process, and one that tends to be favoured by
                                most American and European publishers. How did
                                this process work for you, how much input did
                                the artists have, and what was it like seeing
                                your character come to life in their
                                hands?<\/strong><\/p>\n
                                <p>
                                  &#8220;The collaborative element is what I
                                  enjoy the most. I can&#8217;t tell you how
                                  amazing it is to see the words I&#8217;ve
                                  written translated into images. Mostly,
                                  it&#8217;s better than I hoped. Sometimes
                                  we&#8217;ll discuss how a certain panel is
                                  working and ask for changes.<\/p>\n
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  No one is going to draw the R\u00f3is\u00edn
                                  in my head unless I do &#8211; so I have to
                                  allow the artists to bring their version of
                                  her to the page. A successful comic book
                                  collaboration &#8211; in my experience &#8211;
                                  is about respecting the strengths each person
                                  brings to the project. The writer understands
                                  story dynamics and the artist knows visual
                                  storytelling. You have to learn to depend on
                                  the other person&#8217;s knowledge and
                                  experience to guide changes in the comic
                                  book.<\/p>\n
                                </p>

                                  Also, you have to be open to seeing things
                                  from a different perspective, and accepting
                                  change. I&#8217;m always happy when the artist
                                  makes suggestions that are innovative and work
                                  better than my original concept. We&#8217;re
                                  all pulling together for the same goal: to
                                  create a comic book people will
                                  enjoy.&#8221;<\/p>\n

                                            fun project. Again, Robert Curley
                                            came to me with the core idea, and I
                                            went off and did my research &#8211;
                                            and that was just brilliant. The
                                            1920s was an amazing era of change:
                                            social, economic, and cultural. The
                                            story is lighter, and more in the
                                            detective genre &#8211; albeit with
                                            a supernatural element. Jennifer is
                                            a French artist who &#8211; through
                                            personal tragedy &#8211; becomes
                                            embroiled in a mystery that takes
                                            her from France, to England and
                                            finally to Ireland &#8211; all
                                            helped by the ghost of Oscar
                                            Wilde.<\/p>\n

                                              Writing Wilde is the most
                                              intimidating aspect of the
                                              project. I&#8217;ve done a lot of
                                              research on him, and he was a
                                              brilliant, complex man, but not
                                              always wonderful. I try to be
                                              respectful of who he was and to
                                              bring as much of that to the
                                              project as possible.<\/p>\n

                                                  non-fiction, screenplays short
                                                  stories, poetry, a novel. I
                                                  even have an idea for a comic
                                                  book strip, which I would draw
