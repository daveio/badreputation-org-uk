  Let me begin with some residual New Year

    <strong
      >New Yorker<\/strong>\u2019s music critic <a
      href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Alex_Ross_%28music_critic%29\">Alex
      Ross<\/a> is not the problem here. It\u2019s just that one sometimes needs
      to take an inventory of the symptoms before starting on the cause. Last
      month I attended a talk by Ross on the release of <a
      href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/books\/2010\/nov\/28\/alex-ross-listen-to-this-review\"
      target=\"_blank\">his latest book<\/a>. The talk and the discussion which
      followed were was interesting enough, but throughout the evening I
      couldn\u2019t help noticing that, although there were several women in
      attendance, every single raised voice in the room was male.<\/p>\n
      <p>
        Hardly revelatory, I know. This time last year, I contributed to a
        relatively prominent and very good music blog\u2019s retrospective on
        the best songs of the past decade. More depressing if grimly predictable
        than Kate Nash\u2019s inclusion in the best-of was the fact that, out of
        over forty contributors, I was one of only two women. From the demise of

            music criticism is a truth universally acknowledged.<\/p>\n<div

            <p>
              As part of Ross\u2019s audience, I\u2019m not saying I felt
              excluded or unwelcome, nor did I find the questions less
              interesting, relevant or articulate for being asked in a masculine
              rather than feminine register. But something did click with me
              when, towards the discussion\u2019s end, a man towards the front
              reticently asked Ross: &#8220;This might sound a silly question,
              but \u2013 do you like to dance?&#8221;<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              The opening caveat there is as important as the question itself.
              Let\u2019s start with the latter, which threw into sharp relief
              the varying ways one can engage with music. Let&#8217;s call the
              difference that of Pure versus Applied. Where Alex Ross excels is
              his ability to demystify music, separating and examining its
              component parts. This scholarly and almost clinical approach can
              succeed brilliantly, particularly when discussing Ross\u2019s
              first love, classical music. But, as an exclusive approach, I find
              it lacking, and the absence of attention to dancing helps explain
              why.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              I find it very hard to think of any song I truly love that I
              cannot also dance to &#8211; whether by \u2018dance\u2019 I mean
              drunken mock-waltzing to

                Man) In Hammersmith Palais<\/a><\/strong> or that routine one

                    <\/strong>which involves attempting to stab your knees with
                    your eyebrows. I intellectually analyse the music I love,
                    scouring its lyrical content and its social and cultural
                    context for meaning to enhance my enjoyment of it, but not
                    necessarily to justify my enjoying it in the first place. I
                    am equally interested simply in experiencing its rhythm, its
                    flow, its grind, its melody, the way it makes me want to
                    move as well as the mechanics of how it achieves that, its
                    impact on my body as well as my brain. I attach as much
                    weight to a physical and emotional response as to a cerebral
                    anatomising of music. Until that question was asked, the
                    talk had concentrated wholly on the latter, lacking any
                    consideration of the former, equally useful, dimension of
                    how music works. So no, it wasn\u2019t \u2018a silly
                    question\u2019. Why the questioner, and we, might feel that
                    it is, perhaps approaches the heart of the matter.<\/p>\n
                    <p>
                      I\u2019m sceptical of the patronising and reductive idea
                      that men and women appreciate music in intrinsically
                      different ways, men with a cold and technical analysis and
                      women with an exclusively personal and emotional response.
                      But this scepticism is a continual struggle against the
                      weight of cultural conditioning and its success in
                      bequeathing to boys and girls approved modes of
                      engagement<em
                        >.<\/em> The male = analytical\/female = emotional
                        dichotomy is a counterproductive product of social
                        training, and identifying and questioning this
                        assumption in relation to engagement with music is part
                        of breaking down the barriers between genders and
                        combating sexism in general. Doing so is hindered,
                        however, by the extent to which these different
                        approaches are accorded varying weight in wider
                        discourse, with prevailing attitudes in music criticism
                        privileging one over another. The implications of this
                        will be explored in Part Two.<\/p>\n<p
