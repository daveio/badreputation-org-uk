        Gather &#8217;round, Internet; let me tell you the tale of how I became
        a feminist. It&#8217;s a good one, I promise. Take a seat, please! Open
        your mind-hatch and brace yourselves for my infosquirt.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>(How many articles have I opened like that? ALL OF THEM)<\/p>\n</p>
      <p>
        I discovered that I was a feminist at university. I was nineteen. It
        took an enthusiastic, fiery, inspirational woman with icy blonde hair
        and a stack of books about gender and queer theory explaining to my
        class that feminism was, you know,
        <em
          >Feminism<\/em>, and not, in fact, the exclusive reserve of
          stereotypical humourless Second Wave womyn-born-womyn fanatics.<\/p>\n
          <p>
            This came as a great relief to little transgender me, and
            highlighted that everything I thought about sexuality, gender
            expression and the nature of equality neatly fitted under the
            feminist banner. What a relief! So that made me a feminist, because
            I held those views. And those beliefs were almost unanimously
            implanted in my psyche by an anime called <a

                                set in a high school. It&#8217;s all very sweet
                                to start with; you&#8217;ve got the hero (Utena)
                                and her best friend, and you&#8217;ve got the
                                absurdly powerful school council. And then
                                there&#8217;s a heavy injection of what-the-fuck
                                when you meet the Duelling Theme. There&#8217;s
                                a mechanism in place for long, convoluted
                                reasons, whereby selected Duellists &#8211;

                                to win the Rose Bride as a prize. Her name is
                                Anthy, and her entire purpose is to be a
                                fought-over, won-and-owned slave.<\/p>\n

                                  So far so messed up. But it&#8217;s fucked up
                                  for a purpose. The hero, Utena, has a prince
                                  complex. She wants to &#8211; literally
                                  &#8211; be a prince that rescues princesses
                                  &#8211; that&#8217;s her gender expression.
                                  She cross-dresses habitually and is frequently
                                  described as &#8220;a tomboy&#8221; (despite
                                  actually being quite femme), and she falls in
                                  love with Anthy, primarily by wanting to save
                                  her. The whole series is full of fluid,
                                  ambiguous gender expression and sexuality, and
                                  it&#8217;s treated and handled in a
                                  non-sensational, perfectly intelligible way.
                                  Nothing is mysterious or exotic &#8211; it is
                                  just the way it is.<\/p>\n

                                          adolescence-is-hard story:
                                          there&#8217;s pitch black themes of
                                          rape and sexual coercion in there that
                                          are painful and harrowing to watch,
                                          but resolve themselves. It&#8217;s a
                                          story of survival, but it&#8217;s not
                                          just a story of female survival.
                                          There&#8217;s Utena who is absolutely
                                          not your average girl, and
                                          there&#8217;s Mamiya and Miki, both
                                          femme men, and survivors of the
                                          destructive obsession of
                                          others.<\/p>\n<div

                                            So I fell madly in love with it, as
                                            I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll
                                            understand, because it was a thing
                                            that showed me that there was hope
                                            for me, as a trans* person, because
                                            here was a whole series full of
                                            atypical gender expression that
                                            just<em>
                                              existed<\/em>, neither as a joke
                                              nor as a plot point. It also
                                              demonstrated to me me that it is
                                              possible to fight and vanquish
                                              your ascribed social role.
                                              It&#8217;s a story of seeing
                                              oppression and unfairness and
                                              fighting it with every fibre of
                                              your being. Utena literally gives
                                              her life to liberate Anthy from
                                              her sexual degradation, slavery
                                              and torment because she cannot
                                              live in a world that would condone
                                              and support such condemnation.
                                              Every time I watch the series to
                                              the end (and it&#8217;s bloody
                                              long!) I end up in floods of tears
                                              and with a profound desire to
                                              march around town shouting at
                                              people.<\/p>\n

                                                  without its problems, nothing
                                                  is &#8211; because of how
                                                  powerful and liberating it is
                                                  to watch, but I caution you
                                                  that the themes get darker
                                                  than the forgotten recesses of
                                                  hell and some bits are
                                                  genuinely hard to watch. Each
                                                  character is sympathetic, but
                                                  flawed to fuck, and no-one
                                                  emerges at the other end
                                                  untarnished &#8211; and

                                                    that&#8217;s how people are.
                                                    Despite its weird, fantastic
                                                    elements, it&#8217;s very
