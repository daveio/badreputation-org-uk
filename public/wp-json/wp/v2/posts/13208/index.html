          <p>
            In the dim and distant past, I edited an original anthology of
            horror stories called
            <strong
              >Skin of the Soul<\/strong>. Most of the stories were new (there
              were two reprints) and all of the contributors were women. What
              sparked my decision to do it was an all-male horror anthology
              published a couple of years earlier to much acclaim: <a
              href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Prime_Evil_(anthology)\"
              target=\"_blank\"><strong
                >Prime Evil<\/strong><\/a>, edited by Douglas E. Winter, was a
                showcase for \u201cthe masters of modern horror\u201d, and
                Winter\u2019s introduction was dedicated to the argument that
                horror is not a genre but an emotion, to be found throughout all
                literature,from high to low.<\/p>\n

                <p>
                  I agree; I don\u2019t care much for generic
                  \u201chorror\u201d, even if I prefer it to generic
                  \u201cromance\u201d, and although I\u2019ve written a lot of
                  horror stories, and most of my novels have some element of
                  horror in them (one,
                  <strong
                    >Lost Futures<\/strong>, published as horror in the US, was
                    nominated for a science fiction award in Britain) I\u2019m
                    not that comfortable identifying myself as a \u201chorror
                    writer\u201d.<\/p>\n
                    <p>
                      The writers Winter invited to contribute to his anthology
                      included nearly all the big names of the time (Stephen
                      King, Peter Straub, Clive Barker) but also lesser-known
                      writers (Jack Cady and Paul Hazel). Even the introduction,
                      pointing to the many sources of horror in the mainstream,
                      gave a name-check to just one woman writer throughout
                      literary history.<\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Who was this paragon? You might guess Mary Shelley, Emily
                      Bronte, Christina Rossetti, Edith Wharton, Patricia
                      Highsmith, Shirley Jackson, Anne Rice, Joyce Carol
                      Oates&#8230; but no, the solitary example the editor chose
                      was \u201c&#8230;the best-selling novels of V.C.
                      Andrews.\u201d (I did wonder if he knew her first name was
                      Virginia rather than, say, Victor.)<\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      So I was horrified \u2013 not in a good way \u2013 by this
                      compilation of horrors, and daydreamed about selling my
                      own anthology, inviting a list of excellent writers to
                      contribute, writing my own erudite introduction about
                      great horror fiction of the past. If anyone pointed out
                      that all of those writers were women, I\u2019d act
                      surprised, pretend it was just the luck of the draw, these
                      were the best stories submitted and naturally the examples
                      I chose were my personal favourites.<\/p>\n

                      \/><\/a><br \ />\nI certainly did not set out to
                      deliberately exclude men; there were lots of good male
                      writers, but now that I came to think about it, not many
                      of them wrote horror. I mean real horror, genuinely
                      well-written and original, not that childish gross-out
                      stuff, not those tired generic clich\u00e9s, not dreary
                      old male fantasies, but the kind of thing I wanted to
                      read, because, after all, it only counts as horror in my
                      book if it fits my definition&#8230; and I reserve the
                      right to change the rules whenever I like.<\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Over years of going to conventions, and reading and
                      writing and reviewing (even teaching classes) in the
                      fields of science fiction, fantasy and horror, I\u2019ve
                      noticed how much time is devoted to definitions of genre.
                      Any genre. Once you start putting labels on books, you
                      must justify the inclusion of one and the exclusion of
                      another. This is science fiction, of which I approve,
                      while that is merely fantasy. (I remember Charles Platt
                      defending his choice of interviewees for his first
                      <strong
                        >Who Writes Science Fiction?<\/strong> \u2013 Kate
                        Wilhelm was the only woman, and she was interviewed in
                        tandem with her husband \u2013 but, he explained, Ursula
                        LeGuin had refused his request, and he couldn\u2019t
                        think of any other woman who wrote what he considered to
                        be proper science fiction.)<\/p>\n

                            >Skin of the Soul<\/strong> (\u201cwhich proves
                            indisputably that horror fiction is not a male
                            preserve\u201d, or so said Clive Barker in 1990) , I
                            find that women are still fighting that old battle,
                            still having their contributions to horror ignored
                            or forgotten, I wonder if this isn\u2019t \u2013 at
                            least partly \u2013 something to do with definitions
                            and expectations of genre. And with who is defining
                            it, and why.<\/p>\n
                            <p>
                              Myself, I\u2019ve never limited my reading to one
                              type of fiction, and I don\u2019t write novels
                              that fall neatly into a narrowly defined slot,
                              either. (Maybe this is my problem!) There are some
                              readers for whom genre fiction is comfort food,
                              and they don\u2019t want any nasty surprises when
                              they\u2019ve snuggled down to read \u2013 even in
                              a genre celebrated as the purveyor of nasty
                              surprises. Maybe, for some readers, it
                              doesn\u2019t count as horror unless the author
                              plays by certain rules, unless the story is
                              purveyed via the male gaze, and the name on the
                              title page does nothing to break the illusion that
                              we\u2019re all boys together in this
