  \/><\/a>What about stigma? As we tweeted yesterday, Act Aware isn&#8217;t, and
  should never be, about judging and othering people who are living with HIV. It
  should never be about erasure.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  Unfortunately for all of us, the majority of mainstream media approaches to
  HIV issues in the UK are either woefully ill-informed, groaning under the
  weight of crappily pieced-together assumptions, often even kind of creepily
  bigoted, or just plain fifteen years out of date. Even with <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.nat.org.uk\/Information-and-Resources\/Media-reporting.aspx\">NAT&#8217;s
  helpful press guide<\/a> freely available. Hooray.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  But here&#8217;s a thing: if you&#8217;re reading this, you&#8217;re in luck.
  For lo, the internet is as full of glory as it is full of shit. And with very
  little effort on your part it basically becomes your own PERSONAL BULLSHIT
  ESCAPE TUNNEL. And we&#8217;re about to make it even easier.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  So here are some World AIDS Day links you might or might not have seen before,
  which we&#8217;ve been reading at BadRep Towers. Beyond Acting Aware and
  reading myths and facts, are real people. So go and read about them. Make it
  so!<\/p>\n
