  Disney princesses have a BadRep with feminists, and let&#8217;s face it,
  it&#8217;s easy to see why. Even the recent ones have waists which are about
  as thick as their wrists, and the individual life lessons from each could be
  perceived as so warped as to <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.boingboing.net\/2010\/05\/24\/what-disney-princess.html\">have
  become an internet meme<\/a>.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  But is this really a case of &#8220;Disney-fication&#8221;, with the studio
  taking fairy tales and imposing ruthless mainstream norms on them? There is a
  huge body of work which looks at folk stories from a feminist perspective, and
  I&#8217;m not so qualified to talk about that. What I do find interesting is
  how incredibly polarised much of the source material was in the first
  place.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_5128\" style=\"width: 260px\"

</p>
<p>
  In the European fairy tales which made it big in England and the US (mostly
  Grimm and some French romances), good people are Beautiful and bad people are
  Ugly. This is true whether you&#8217;re a stepsister, a witch or an ogre;
  physical ugliness goes along with agressive or dangerous behaviour every time.
  <strong
    >Good = Beautiful<\/strong>, and this is not negotiable. (Try the reverse:
    try finding anyone ugly who you&#8217;re meant to cheer for. You&#8217;ve
    got maybe a 1% chance. Less if they&#8217;re female.)<\/p>\n
    <p>
      It gets better though, because that &#8220;bad&#8221; behaviour is very
      specific: it is always an act against the interests of the Heroine or
      Hero. Being a female magic-user doesn&#8217;t make you a witch; you could
      be a fairy godmother. No-one asks the Godmothers what they spend the rest
      of their time doing, they are entirely defined by whether they bless or
      curse the Heroine. In some tales, it&#8217;s only because one out of
      thirteen of them is not given an invitation that she decides to curse the
      child &#8211; would the others have acted similarly if it had been one or
      more of them instead? We don&#8217;t know. But once the curse is given,
      that Godmother is fair game for a horrible death and probably had a secret
      hooked nose all along. The Disney versions of Fairy Godmothers may be
      tittering clouds of pink benevolence, but they aren&#8217;t often
      described as &#8220;kind&#8221; in the tales &#8211; they are only judged
      as &#8220;Good&#8221; or &#8220;Bad&#8221; by whether they&#8217;re
      currently on our side or not.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      It&#8217;s also problematical if we use behaviour to judge who the
      &#8220;good girl&#8221; is. The modern versions of Cinderella, Snow White
      and Sleeping Beauty are all very similar: beautiful, virtuous daughters
      who get into trouble and need rescuing. It might be a fall into poverty,
      or danger from an outsider (new stepmother, <del
      datetime=\"2011-05-02T11:32:43+00:00\">hot men<\/del> a wolf) but
      there&#8217;s one critical element to being the Good girl and that is
      <em
        >passivity<\/em>. Red Riding Hood doesn&#8217;t kill the wolf.
        Cinderella runs away and is found (hunted down door-to-door, really) by
        the Prince, without announcing herself even up to the moment that the
        shoe goes on. He and her fairy Godmother are the ones taking all the
        action to save her. Snow White \/ Sleeping Beauty are
        unconscious\/dead.<\/p>\n
        <p>
          We already saw in Markgraf&#8217;s <a
          href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/2011\/04\/22\/at-the-movies-red-riding-hood\/\">movie
          review of Red Riding Hood<\/a> that a young woman choosing the wrong
          man could derail society&#8217;s plans (in a time when arranged
          marriages to a virgin were crucial). All these messages are saying
          that you need to be compliant, dutiful and passive. If you are a woman
          who is aggressive, demanding, loud, insists on her own needs or has
          control over her life, chances are you&#8217;re a wicked stepmother
          and only a few days away from the awesome kind of ending Disney oddly
          decided to leave out:<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <strong
              >&#8220;That she should be thrown into a cask stuck around with
              sharp nails, and that two white horses should be put to it, and
              should drag it from street to street till she is
              dead.&#8221;<\/strong><br \ />\nThe Goose Girl &#8211; Brothers
              Grimm<\/p><\/blockquote>\n
              <p>
                The destiny of the Hero is often no less automatic. He is
                invariably given a beautiful Princess as a prize, to be his
                wife. Winning her hand is sometimes the only reason he takes on
                the quest in the first place. The task is often set by her
                father, who expects the Hero to be killed instead of succeeding,
                and at no time does the woman have any say in this
                arrangement.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                So given the source material for the stories which Disney
                decided to take on, if they remained roughly true to the spirit
                of the tale, is it really fair to bash Disney as much as we
                do?<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>Oh hell yes.<\/p>\n</p>
              <p>
                First of all, they have a choice on which ones to produce.
                Chrissy Derbyshire in her essay &#8220;Toads and Diamonds&#8221;
                for <a
                href=\"http:\/\/avaloniabooks.co.uk\/221\/?page_id=438\">the
                anthology &#8220;Vs&#8221;<\/a> (which looks at Duality in
                magic, mythology and religion) points out that there are tales
                where the magic is entirely neutral, such as a Genie granting
                wishes. If the person making the wish is bad, sucks to be them.
                If they are altruistic and peaceful, they&#8217;ll probably be
                okay. There are plenty of tales Disney could have gone with
                which say &#8220;a person&#8217;s actions define them&#8221;,
                not &#8220;poverty and an evil stepmother can only be solved by
                marrying the right guy&#8221;.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                Now okay, not all of the stories which deviate from the
                &#8220;good gets rewarded&#8221; trope would make great movies.
                I think it&#8217;s a Brothers Grimm tale which reads roughly
                (and I am not making this up) &#8220;<em
                  >Little Erik was a good boy and never did anything wrong, but
                  one he died anyway because that&#8217;s just how it goes
                  sometimes.<\/em>&#8221; I can see how choosing your targets
                  for conversion to animation is a valid excuse.<\/p>\n
                  <p>
                    Even within that though, there&#8217;s still the question of
                    the famous Disney poetic licence. They have a history of
                    sanitising and whitewashing these stories for maximum
                    profit, and it&#8217;s very rarely to inject any feminist
                    ideas. Sure, in the 90s the women such as Belle in
                    <em
                      >Beauty and the Beast<\/em> became Independent and
                      Argumentative&#8230; but only in strictly approved
                      mainstream ways, to entirely fit the current belief of
                      what would be PC. There are no lesbians in Disney, no
                      women who don&#8217;t want a lifelong relationship by the
                      end. It may be that the Victorians had already santised
                      the tales by the time Disney picked them up, but that only
                      works as an excuse for so long.<\/p>\n
                      <p>
                        Okay, Sleeping Beauty physically
                        <em
                          >can&#8217;t<\/em> save herself &#8211; there&#8217;s
                          no way Disney could have got around that &#8211; but
                          even when they try to be PC in recent efforts it is
                          only ever in a way which won&#8217;t scandalise the
                          lowest common denominator of American audiences. The
                          source material may praise beauty, passivity and
                          rescuing, but Disney have never hesitated to edit
                          other aspects of the stories to something more
                          palatable. Even in recent times when the female
                          characters actually have, well,
                          <em
                            >character<\/em>, the one aspect which apparently
                            <em
                              >mustn&#8217;t<\/em> change is the straining of
                              credibility that their tiny bodies wouldn&#8217;t
                              collapse under the weight of their own organs.

                              Ariel&#8217;s. Sleeping Beauty is presumably
                              wearing a corset, but I&#8217;m not sure if
                              that&#8217;s an improvement when you&#8217;re
