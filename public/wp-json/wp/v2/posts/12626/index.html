  This month I finally bring you <a title=\"Borderlands 2 website\"
  href=\"http:\/\/www.borderlands2.com\/us\/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong
    >Borderlands 2<\/strong><\/a>. \u00a0I took my time, I enjoyed myself, and I
    promised I&#8217;d complete at least one run-through before gabbling on
    about it, and that I have.<\/p>\n
    <h3>
      Borderlands 2, or &#8216;the Accidental-on-Purpose, not-so-secret,
      feminist game&#8217;<\/h3>\n
      <p>
        There really is\u00a0<em
          >a lot<\/em> that can be said about
          <strong
            >BL2<\/strong>, and although I&#8217;m not going to say it all,
            I&#8217;ve picked up on some points I think are more relevant for
            BadRep. \u00a0It isn&#8217;t, however, as hard as you might expect
            to find good, feminist-friendly things to say about
            <strong
              >BL2<\/strong>. In fact, it&#8217;s probably one of the best AAA
              titles in terms of its ability to give players something quite
              egalitarian as an overall experience.<\/p>\n
              <p>
                Basic game-stuff first, though: keeping to form,
                <strong
                  >Borderlands 2<\/strong> is beautiful. \u00a0Hand-painted
                  landscapes, smooth animation, great character design,
                  brilliant monsters and, like, a gazillion-billion guns and
                  other loot items. \u00a0It&#8217;s an FPS\/RPG that combines
                  the best of both game styles; you can recognise the
                  colour-coded scale of awesomeness for your loot alongside the
                  superb right-in-there combat mechanics. \u00a0You can grind,
                  farm, explore &#8211; whatever. \u00a0It&#8217;s fun. \u00a0A
                  lot of fun.<\/p>\n

                    \/><\/a>It&#8217;s available on the three big platforms
                    (PS3, Xbox 360, PC) and is big on multiplayer, though
                    frankly it&#8217;s just as great solo. However, the one
                    thing that annoys me with these big multi-platform titles
                    and multiplayer is that we can&#8217;t interact with each
                    other.<\/p>\n
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While I can play through
                    <strong
                      >Steam<\/strong> with one friend, my
                      <strong
                        >Xbox<\/strong> friend can&#8217;t join in and is left
                        to languish alone with inferior loot. \u00a0Not the
                        fault of the game &#8211; more the big console companies
                        trying to keep their corner of the market isolated
                        &#8211; but it&#8217;s still a letdown.<\/p>\n
                        <p>
                          Anyway, these things aside, why is this such a great
                          egalitarian game? \u00a0Put simply, it takes the piss.
                          \u00a0Out of everyone. \u00a0On the surface of things,
                          anyone is fair game, but(!) if you listen and observe,
                          what I&#8217;ve noticed is that there&#8217;s a bit of
                          a slant on the piss-takings, and it&#8217;s a positive
                          one. \u00a0I&#8217;ll give you some examples, but from
                          here on out,

                              My two favourite NPCs are <a title=\"Borderlands
                              Wikia: Ellie\"
                              href=\"http:\/\/borderlands.wikia.com\/wiki\/Ellie\"
                              target=\"_blank\">Ellie<\/a> and <a
                              title=\"Borderlands Wikia: Tiny Tina\"
                              href=\"http:\/\/borderlands.wikia.com\/wiki\/Tiny_Tina\"
                              target=\"_blank\">Tina<\/a>. They&#8217;re both
                              great examples of powerful, self-confident,
                              self-reliant women who\u00a0<em
                                >aren&#8217;t<\/em> your average pin-up
                                character and who represent integral, practical
                                and useful components of the story &amp;
                                mission.<\/p>\n

                                  They&#8217;re not decoration over in the
                                  corner of the room; they&#8217;re key to your
                                  success. \u00a0Ellie is a mechanic (and a bit
                                  of a whizz at that) and she&#8217;s a larger
                                  woman. \u00a0She loves it, and so does the
                                  game and its creators.<\/p>\n
