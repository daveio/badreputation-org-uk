    The government&#8217;s point of view was that it was time to make big
    decisions about priorities.<\/p>\n

      Clarke\" href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-11741289\"

      <p>
        In cutting legal aid for nearly all areas affecting the family sphere,
        the government has made it very clear where their priorities lie, and it
        is not with the most vulnerable members of society. The cuts are all
        over the place \u2013 family law, immigration, employment \u2013 and it
        is difficult to decide which of these is going to disadvantage women the
        most.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        Even looking at a single area &#8211; family law &#8211; yields some
        very interesting data. Legal aid is not available for uncontested
        divorces, it can only be applied for where the other party <a
        title=\"Divorce and Separation\"
        href=\"http:\/\/www.newhamdvf.org.uk\/Divorce.html\"
        target=\"_blank\">contests the petition<\/a>. Of the divorces granted in
        2008 in England and Wales, 67% were granted to the wife. For all of the
        divorces granted, unreasonable behaviour was the <a title=\"National
        Statistics Online - Divorces\"
        href=\"http:\/\/www.statistics.gov.uk\/cci\/nugget.asp?id=170\"
        target=\"_blank\">most common reason for divorce<\/a>. Of the contested
        divorces initiated, women were <a title=\"Legal Aid in Divorce\"
        href=\"http:\/\/www.terry.co.uk\/legaid.html\" target=\"_blank\">more
        likely to be granted Legal Aid<\/a> as they are more likely to have no
        income of their own.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        Taking Legal Aid away from contested divorce cases, therefore, is likely
        to result in far fewer cases being brought before the court, as the main
        instigators of divorce proceedings will not be able to afford to do so.
        So what are the alternatives if you\u2019re stuck in a marriage and you
        want out?<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1143\" style=\"width: 310px\"

          <p>
            Well, there\u2019s mediation, which only works if the two
            individuals can agree on an amicable arrangement. I\u2019m thinking
            that most people wouldn\u2019t want to go through the court process
            if an amicable arrangement was possible. Even setting aside the
            thorny issue of child custody, solicitors claim that <a
            title=\"Belfast Telegraph\"
            href=\"http:\/\/www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk\/news\/local-national\/northern-ireland\/divorce-report-finds-11year-itch-14901806.html\"
            target=\"_blank\">4 out of 5 men try to hide wealth in divorce
            settlements<\/a>. Going to court can prevent this through the
            agreement of a \u201cconsent order\u201d deciding how property and
            assets are to be split. If the parties do not follow the order, the
            court can then enforce it. I find it laughable that those men would
            volunteer their hidden wealth because they\u2019re around a
            mediation table rather than in a court room. Net result: wives lose
            out in a settlement, and have no recourse if the other party reneges
            on the agreement.<\/p>\n

              <p>
                Suppose that it\u2019s worse, and that the woman is in an
                abusive relationship. Currently, if a woman wishes to keep her
                address secret, she can apply to use her solicitor\u2019s
                address<a title=\"Divorce and Separation\"
                href=\"http:\/\/www.newhamdvf.org.uk\/Divorce.html\"
                target=\"_blank\"> <\/a>instead of her own. Most importantly for
                violent cases, it is recognised that mediation, which is
                voluntary, is inappropriate where there is a fear of violence by
                either party. Ah, I hear you cry, but funding will continue for

              </p>
              <p>
                The thing is, \u201cdomestic violence\u201d comes under section
                (b) of the Act, \u201cunreasonable behaviour\u201d. This
                doesn\u2019t need to include the particulars of any violence
                experienced, but can be something much milder. In fact, unless
                the husband has a string of convictions for violence, it\u2019s
                actually easier in some ways to have a divorce granted by citing
                milder grounds, as the other party is <a title=\"Grounds of

                violence cases under-reported, it is difficult to estimate how
                many mild petitions for \u201cunreasonable behaviour\u201d hide
                battery and abuse. 77% of domestic violence victims are women, 1
                in 4 women will experience domestic violence in their lifetime,

                                              The government&#8217;s point of
                                              view was that it was time to make
                                              big decisions about priorities.

                                              cutting legal aid for nearly all
                                              areas affecting the family sphere,
                                              the government has made it very
                                              clear where their priorities lie,
                                              and it is not with the most
                                              vulnerable members of society.
