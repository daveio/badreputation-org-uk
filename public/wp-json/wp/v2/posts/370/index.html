  up, an appreciation for consequences and understanding the laws that govern
  this country. A decision, which I personally support, was taken by the <a

  Society<\/a> to take the government to court over the gender inequality in the
  budget cuts announced this week. Cuts will affect <a

  that more women held on to their jobs than men was because we are <a

</p>
<p>
  To head off any arguments at the pass, I believe that these cuts are more a
  <strong
    >political decision rather then an economic one<\/strong> and that the
    government has taken over a country in a time of
    <em
      >perceived<\/em> crisis and confusion, using the &#8220;chaos&#8221; as a
      convenient smokescreen to push through its own agenda without the
      appropriate debate, safeguards or reference to GCSE economics textbooks.
      But the wrong-headedness of the budget is better discussed by <a
      href=\"http:\/\/liberalconspiracy.org\/2010\/10\/20\/countering-the-coalition-cuts-narrative-a-myth-busting-guide\/\">Liberal
      Conspiracy<\/a> and <a
      href=\"http:\/\/www.redpepper.org.uk\/Countering-the-cuts-myths\">Red
      Pepper<\/a>. Direct arguments over the necessity of the cuts there.<\/p>\n
      <p>
        I&#8217;ve been thinking specifically about the gulf of difference
        between what is<em>
          legally allowable<\/em> and what is
          <em
            >morally correct<\/em>, and more importantly what we can do to
            bridge the divide. I&#8217;m not going to back down on my assertion
            that morality is the right word to use here &#8211; a budget which
            is demonstrably more unfair (it&#8217;s a generally unfair budget)
            to women than to men is an<em>
              immoral budget<\/em>. So far, so philosophical.<\/p>\n
              <p>
                This is where it gets better. This is where we get practical.
                The valuable question posed by the Fawcett Society is whether it
                is also an
                <em
                  >illegal budget<\/em>, because if so, then there are grounds
                  for actual change. Not only in this instance but for the
                  future. If they succeed then there will be precedent for
                  further challenges to unequal, unacceptable political
                  decisions.<\/p>\n

                      rights that we need. Laws do not stand up for themselves.
                      We need to make the system work for us. The tools for
                      change are there. We need the knowledge to wield them and

                            our disposal to ensure that the laws that should
                            protect us are enforced. Otherwise they are
