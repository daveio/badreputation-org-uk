            Once upon a time, some people hatched upon an idea for a film.\u00a0
            &#8220;Let&#8217;s make a film about an undercover agent,
            who&#8217;s so far under cover, NO-ONE knows who he&#8217;s working
            for any more!\u00a0 Not even him!&#8221;<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            &#8220;Awesome!&#8221; said some other dudes.\u00a0 &#8220;And there
            can be car chases and gun-fights and explosions!&#8221;<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            &#8220;&#8230;And spiders!&#8221; said Brian, from the back.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            &#8220;And there&#8217;ll be a
            <em
              >torture scene<\/em>,&#8221; the other dudes continued, &#8220;And
              <em
                >bombs<\/em>, and we can blow up a
                <em
                  >church<\/em>.&#8221;\u00a0 They continued in this vein,
                  getting more and more excited about the idea, until one of
                  them (not Brian, who was playing with an orbweb he&#8217;d
                  found) said, &#8220;But who are we going to get to play this
                  guy?&#8221;<\/p>\n
                  <p>
                    And the conversation went quiet.\u00a0 &#8220;Er,&#8221;
                    said one of them, &#8220;Jason&#8230; Statham?&#8221;<\/p>\n
                  </p>
                  <p>&#8220;Nah, he needs to speak Russian.&#8221;<\/p>\n</p>
                  <p>&#8220;Russell Crowe?&#8221;<\/p>\n</p>
                  <p>
                    &#8220;GOD no.\u00a0 And he&#8217;s still too busy getting
                    fellated by Ridley Scott.&#8221;<\/p>\n
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The conversation fell silent as they contemplated the
                    options.\u00a0 They needed someone serious, energetic,
                    stealthy, Russian-speaking and with the personal chutzpah to
                    carry such a multifaceted title role.<\/p>\n
                  </p>
                  <p>&#8220;Angelina Jolie!&#8221; said Brian.<\/p>\n</p>
                  <p>
                    The other guys looked at him.\u00a0 &#8220;Brian,&#8221;
                    someone said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know if anyone&#8217;s
                    ever told you, but

                      <p>
                        Brian blinked a few times.\u00a0 &#8220;So?&#8221; he

                          &#8211; it was written with a bloke in mind for the
                          title role, but the part ended up in Angelina
                          Jolie&#8217;s bony little hands.\u00a0 And she does
                          well!\u00a0 She does really well.\u00a0 I say this
                          quite apart from my love of good old Ange&#8217;s
                          acting &#8211; she&#8217;s severe, stalwart and
                          precise, which is exactly what the role needs.<\/p>\n
                          <p>
                            But you can see the seams where they&#8217;ve added
                            things in or changed things so that the role is
                            &#8220;more suitable for a woman&#8221;.\u00a0 There
                            aren&#8217;t many things.\u00a0 Hell, she casts
                            aside her heels in favour of being barefoot in order
                            to escape the CIA and make a rocket launcher out of
                            a table leg and a fire extinguisher.<\/p>\n

                              Like, at the beginning when, as I said, she makes
                              a rocket launcher out of cleaning products, spit
                              and hope &#8211; she&#8217;s been using the fire
                              extinguisher to blind the CCTV cameras as she
                              goes, and when she starts to need that for her
                              improvised explosive device, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
                              comes to her brilliant mind, apparently, to cover
                              the camera in the room

                                  chemicals at her disposal and chooses to blind
                                  a camera with her (small, black, lacy)

                                  (male) action heroes who have used their
                                  underwear to stealth past unwanted
                                  observers.\u00a0 Do you remember that bit in

                                        shaky and squeamish.\u00a0 There&#8217;s
                                        a bit, for instance, where she smashes a
                                        bottle and glasses a man to death with
                                        it.\u00a0 All you see of this action is
