<p>
  I keep hearing the word &#8220;alpha&#8221; and it keeps making me retch, so
  I&#8217;ve decided to crack my knuckles and take a punch. I am fed up of the
  way it is applied to humans. Specifically men. Specifically as a &#8220;good
  thing&#8221; for men to be and for straight women (more on a queer point of
  view later) to want to have in their partners.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  <strong
    >Underlying it all is the idea that being an alpha male is a good idea (for
    men) and that having alpha males is a good idea for society.\u00a0 I
    disagree.<\/strong><\/p>\n
    <p>
      So let&#8217;s look at some definitions to get the balls rolling.
      I&#8217;m using <a
      href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Alpha_%28ethology%29\">wiki<\/a>
      and an A level in Biology here, so Actual Scientists please have your
      white lab coats and clipboards at the ready to score me on this one. The
      David Attenborough lexicon would have &#8220;alpha male&#8221; as a
      perfectly acceptable term for the dominant male in a group of pack animals
      (note that not all alphas found in nature are de facto male, and often you
      will find an &#8220;alpha pair&#8221; as the sole breeders in a group).
      This usually resembles a social set of multiple females and their young,
      sometimes including juvenile males. Social dynamics vary from species to
      species but generally the defining trait of the &#8220;alpha
      male&#8221;\u00a0 is that he is the
      <strong
        >only sexually active male<\/strong> in the group &#8211; all the
        females mate with him alone and he will chase off or kill other males
        who approach.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_218\" style=\"width: 310px\"

        <p>
          So far, so Darwin. By constantly battling to be top dog, the male
          maintains his status as physically fit to father offspring and
          consequently he&#8217;s the best genetic offering for the females.
          Now, let&#8217;s step away from the forest and into the urban jungle
          to look at human animals.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>Why do we like to apply this term to men?<\/p>\n</p>
        <p>
          Superficially, it&#8217;s all very easy, obvious and media-friendly to
          ascribe animal behaviours and terminology to people for a handy
          reference point.\u00a0 The list is vast and serves as shorthand for
          personalities. &#8220;Alpha male&#8221; carries with it all those
          connotations that we like to think of as traditionally masculine
          &#8211; aggression, sexual dominance, high status. However, like all
          metaphors it can be carried too far to be rendered meaningless, and
          this is absolutely the case with &#8220;alpha males&#8221;.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          The parallels between humans and animals only go so far. We
          don&#8217;t live in a forest. We don&#8217;t hunt our food using our
          own hands and teeth. We don&#8217;t compete for space, food or shelter
          in the same way that animals do. We don&#8217;t live like animals, so
          why are we aspiring to their structures? Our society is complicated
          and challenging, and yes, there is competition, but the idea that we
          are basing all our actions on base instinct inherited from our
          ancestors, and that this is a good way to live is absurd, and frankly,
          oversimplistic.<\/p>\n<div style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption

          Worse still than caveman antics, the term has become something for men
          to aspire to without really thinking of the consequences of persuading
          50% of the population to butt heads and massacre every other man in
          sight. There are hundreds of websites dedicated to becoming an alpha
          male.\u00a0 Some are <a

                Let&#8217;s get this straight from the get-go. I hate the use of
                the word &#8220;alpha male&#8221;. Whenever I hear it, my brain
                automatically erases those two words and replaces them with
                &#8220;wanker&#8221; or &#8220;desperately insecure&#8221;. I
                think it&#8217;s a terrible metaphor both for masculinity and
                for relationships between (straight) men and (straight) women,
                and the more we can question it the sooner we can throw it into
                the bin and come up with something a little bit better.\u00a0 So
                on to the questioning.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                What are the implications of having &#8220;alpha males&#8221; in
                our society? First, it creates a hierarchy in which the men who
                can bag the most women are the best.\u00a0 Being an alpha is
                about being the manliest of men, and that means not being
                &#8220;feminine&#8221; or &#8220;gay&#8221; &#8211; both are of
                course bad things to be.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong
                  >The inclusion of alphas in our society immediately makes it a
                  sexist one &#8211; no room for the gay, the bi or the queer.
                  No room for anything other than manly-men and womanly-women.
                  And it places us all in an &#8220;us versus them&#8221;
                  scenario with prospective partners.<\/strong><\/p>\n
                  <p>
                    Sexual conquest is all. This sets up a contest for male
                    dominance which requires female (and other male) submission.
                    In order to &#8220;win&#8221; the female must
                    &#8220;lose&#8221; &#8211; as must the other men trying to
                    get her. Women are a prize or a target. Other men are
                    competition. Hardly the basis for a co-operative or
                    productive society. This kind of scenario is clearly seen in
                    the<a

                    <\/a>which aims to reduce a woman&#8217;s confidence (often

                    place).<\/p>\n

                        What we are looking at here is in fact a\u00a0 zero sum
                        power exchange in which no one wins.\u00a0 Rather than
                        both parties coming out of it feeling postive or ready
                        to build something for the future, one of them is
                        tricked and the other knows they have played a trick. It
                        might be smug and satisfying to con someone into bed,
                        but I don&#8217;t think that kind of underhanded
                        behaviour is a worthwhile measure of a man.<\/p>\n
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Being an alpha male, or trying to be one, is bad for
                        men. There are a few ways in which this works. The first
                        is the manipulative gameplayer outlined above.
                        That&#8217;s a common (and deeply unpleasant) way of
                        living, but if all you want is sex, then it might make
                        someone a terrible person but it might not make them
                        feel bad about themselves. The other ways probably will.
                        For one thing, if masculinity and self worth all about
                        how attractive men are to women, then there&#8217;s a
                        problem. This is a game that we women have been playing
                        for a long time (being attractive to men, that is) and
                        it&#8217;s not a lot of fun, so I don&#8217;t really
                        advise it.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1028\"

                        quite hard not to look at. You want to be an alpha? You
                        want to attract the most ladies? Well, this is what you
                        need to look like then &#8211; a torso you could play

                        personality? Not sure about those pants though, baby.
                        Here, let me help you with those.<\/p>\n
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        A world in which we encourage men to become alphas is
                        one in which we are telling them that their appearance
                        and sexual attractiveness is their only important
                        feature.<\/p>\n
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The other reality of the alpha male is a lonely and
                        isolated existence, in which other men are to be
                        rejected for fear they take away &#8220;your&#8221;
                        women, and women themselves are only of use for the
                        notch they can put in your bedpost. The nature of being
                        an alpha is to be uncollaborative and unyielding,
                        thereby contributing towards \u201cstrong and
                        silent\u201d archetypes that have coloured our view of
                        maleness for many years, resulting in an idealised
                        brooding male.<\/p>\n

                        Being around an alpha male is also bad for women. It
                        means being one of many &#8220;conquests&#8221; instead
                        of someone special. It means always worrying about being
                        played or being tricked.<\/p>\n
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        It means that your partner just wants you for sex and
                        possibly just to display their own ability to have sex
                        with you. It means being valued for your ability to make
                        them look good rather than because they enjoy your
                        company or even, heaven forbid, like you. And in order
                        to maintain this status quo they will constantly have to
                        put you down in order to feel big, hard and clever.
                        Ladies &#8211; this one is a keeper.<\/p>\n

                        Having alpha males
                        <em
                          >at all<\/em> is bad for a proper, grown-up society.
                          The alpha male condition reduces the wonderful variety
                          of men in our midst into nothing more than adrenaline
                          pumped, testosterone fuelled, muscle bound animals.
                          Suitable only to fight each other and die for the
                          glory of impregnation. It replaces personality with a
                          set of operational parameters. And frankly, I want
                          better for the men in my life and the men in the
                          world.<\/p>\n
