    >A few snapshots of different sorts of feminists, their families and the
    festive season. I\u2019m fortunate to have lots of lovely people in my

            <p>
              I&#8217;m <a href=\"http:\/\/kate.craig-wood.com\">Kate
              Craig-Wood<\/a> and I&#8217;m a technology entrepreneur. I&#8217;m
              the managing director of Memset, a family business founded and
              owned by my brother and I. As one of the tiny number of highly
              successful businesswomen in IT I try to be a bit of a role model
              and am a big advocate for getting more girls into science and
              technology where they are much needed!<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              I&#8217;m very aware that my approach to Christmas, and to my
              domestic arrangements for that matter, are opposite to the
              perceived (and, in my experience, common) societal norm of the
              woman doing the bulk of the present shopping. I attribute this in
              no small part to my upbringing. I am transgendered, and was raised
              as a boy, though I have always had a female brain. That is the
              nature of transsexuality: during gestation the brain
              differentiates one way and the body another.<\/p>\n<div

            <p>
              In stark contrast to my sister I was brought up to be confident,
              assertive, comfortable with being the breadwinner and with
              delegating responsibilities. This is not to say I have always been
              in such a relationship dynamic; I&#8217;ve often been the
              &#8220;present buyer&#8221; in the past, but it does mean I do not
              feel restricted to that stereotypical role in the way that my
              little sister appears to. My partner, a student at present and
              himself unfettered by gender stereotypes, is happy to fulfill that
              role and I am very busy with work, so it makes sense. I firmly
              believe that if my sister had been afforded the same sort of
              upbringing as me she would not feel trapped into the
              often-stressful role of Christmas coordinator, but instead she
              struggles to ask her husband for help.<\/p>\n

                <p>
                  Spending it with my family. Sadly I can&#8217;t have children
                  of my own, but my brother and sister have six between them.
                  Christmas is a time for me to spoil my nieces and nephews and
                  usually ends up with me being knee deep in chocolate wrappers
                  and lego!<\/p>\n

                    <p>
                      I&#8217;m fortunate to have a very organised boyfriend,
                      with whom the stereotypical roles are very reversed
                      &#8211; I&#8217;m the breadwinner and he takes care of the
                      household and &#8220;detail&#8221;. This means that (with
                      a little input from me) he takes care of the bulk of the
                      Christmas shopping, and I just have to get things for him,
                      my brother and my sister.<\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I&#8217;m showering him with gadgets this year: an Xbox
                      Kinect, a big screen for his office (mainly for gaming),
                      and some fancy headphones. For my brother, a deep
                      intellectual, I&#8217;m getting a pile of books, the main
                      being Stephen Wolfram&#8217;s

                        <p>
                          The younger kids are fairly easy, especially the boys
                          &#8211; lots of Star Wars Lego! Shopping for my older
                          niece (14) and nephew (13) is getting harder, but
                          anything from Superdry still seems to be in
                          young-teen-vogue!<\/p>\n
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          My sister is always the difficulty. A dedicated mum
                          and thus something of a polar opposite to me as the
                          career woman (we often joke how between us we have all
                          the bases covered), there are only so many bits of
                          jewelery, smellies and scarves one can buy her! She
                          has been having a hard time lately, and we don&#8217;t
                          spend enough time together, so this year I&#8217;ve
                          decided to give her a shopping trip (so I can check
                          she likes the things I get her first) and a spa day,
                          also with me, plus various small bits.<\/p>\n
                        </p>

                            <p>
                              I get the big items online, and leave the rest
                              until the very last minute. Everyone thinks
                              I&#8217;m mad to go Christmas shopping on
                              Christmas Eve, but I find it works rather well for
                              those stocking filler items. My local town centre
                              is pretty quiet &#8211; the shops have plenty of
                              stock since they are ready for the post-Christmas
                              sales, and the time pressure really focuses the
                              mind! Rather than visiting one shop, seeing
                              something suitable, but then prevaricating, it
                              forces one to be decisive then and there.<\/p>\n

                                <p>
                                  Christmas&#8217;s approach tends to be
                                  generally stressful.\u00a0We don&#8217;t tend
                                  to host over the period, going to those with
                                  children rather than them having to move the
                                  family to us, so it is not that, but more just
                                  a coincidence of deadlines. On the one hand
                                  there are presents to buy, which even with
                                  assistance I struggle to find time to do in
                                  advance, but it is more work and the business
                                  of transitioning a company from one financial
                                  year to the next with lots of people taking
                                  time off in between!<\/p>\n

                                  I know I will enjoy the festive period when
                                  I&#8217;m in it, but as with most holidays,
                                  the prospect of stepping away from my desk for
                                  a week or two causes undue worry. Since we
                                  provide 24\/7 services I feel a responsibility
                                  to ensure that everything is in order ahead of
                                  this break in particular so that my customers
                                  and staff don&#8217;t end up having any
                                  unwanted interruptions to their
