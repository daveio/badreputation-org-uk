      <\/strong><\/p>\n
      <p>
        Last week my friend Tom and I decided to exchange nerdy hobbies. I would
        take him to a Live Action Roleplay Game (more on that in another post)
        and he would take me to an <a
        href=\"http:\/\/www.firstandonlyairsoft.com\/airsoft\/\">airsoft
        game<\/a>.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        For those who haven&#8217;t indulged, Airsoft is a bit like paintball,
        except instead of getting splattered with paint you get hit with little
        plastic pellets (pictured) that are fired really quite fast (I spent the
        next week or so covered in little red welts and looked like I had lazy
        measles). The aim is for &#8220;realism&#8221;, so the guns used are of
        a similar weight and style to actual military weapons. Finally, if this
        were not enough excitement for one evening, you can use flares that you
        throw onto the ground near your opponent. These explode with bright
        light and a loud bang.<br \ />\n<a

        Obviously this is very cool, and equally obviously, it&#8217;s a rather
        boy-heavy activity. Looking for pictures for this post, I put
        &#8220;airsoft&#8221; into Google images and the only pictures of women
        I found were of a pretty blonde lady (titled &#8220;booth babe&#8221;
        sadly) at an airsoft gun show. When we arrived at the <a
        href=\"http:\/\/www.firstandonlyairsoft.com\/venues\/the-mall\/\">abandoned
        shopping centre<\/a> (I told you it was cool) there were only two women
        &#8211; myself and my friend Kate.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        The &#8220;safe room&#8221; in which we got ready started to fill up
        with men, most of whom seemed to know each other and started the kind of
        cameradarie rituals that made me start to reconsider whether this was
        really a good idea. I have an abiding memory from my childhood of trying
        to play street football or cricket with the boys who lived on my road
        and having balls deliberately thrown at my face until I went home,
        red-faced and in frustrated tears, to parachute My Little Ponies from my
        bedroom window, imagining my former teammates as the target of my
        plastic equine revenge. Thus, my brain started to fill with concerns
        about deliberate assault aimed at exclusion.<\/p>\n

        \/><\/a>Once we&#8217;d got our kit and got briefed, we went into the
        combat area. The group was split into two teams and we spent the evening
        playing a series of &#8220;wargames&#8221; like Capture the Flag and
        similar scenarios with breaks for energy drinks, chocolate bars and hot
        dogs.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the course of the night I started to get a feel for the space and
        for how the games were played &#8211; there are a series of rules on
        safety and on recognising fellow teammates (a challenge when it&#8217;s
        dark and you&#8217;re wearing black). I needn&#8217;t have worried about
        the gender-exclusion problem. Once in the field, with facemask, guns and
        black camo gear on, the fact that I was a girl stopped being important
        &#8211; or even especially noticeable. Instead the fact that I was a
        &#8220;fae ninja&#8221; (not my words, but they kept me grinning for
        days) who could run really fast and sneak with the best of them meant
        that I was as challenging an opponent as the next really fast, really
        sneaky person.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>I had an amazing time.<\/p>\n</p>
      <p>
        Heart racing, running through darkened corridors, finding cover, rolling
        out of the way of explosives and even taking command a couple of
        times.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        A memorable moment was drawing out and picking off a few of the opposing
        team in a corridor, then hiding in a pitch black room, back pressed
        against the wall as their torchbeams sliced just past me.\u00a0 Slowly,
        dreadfully slowly, they hesitantly pushed the door open and entered the
        space where they believed many shooters lay in wait. And I opened fire.
        It was a battle that I eventually lost, being horribly outnumbered
        &#8211; but that resulted in a handshake from the other side for giving
        good game.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        Much credit goes to the people running <a
        href=\"http:\/\/www.firstandonlyairsoft.com\/\"><strong
          >First and Only Airsoft<\/strong><\/a>, who made absolutely no
          concession or acknowledgment of our gender. I felt welcomed and looked
          after, was given a good briefing on the kit, and felt sure and safe in
          using the guns. At no point was I talked down to, or treated as in any
          way different from anyone else who was there to have fun.<\/p>\n
