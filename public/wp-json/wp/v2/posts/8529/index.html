                        that women in horror are condemned to inhabit a narrow
                        range of stock characters. Is this the case in the Grand
                        Guignol? What are these characters? Where did they
                        tropes originate? What purposes do they
                        serve?<\/strong><br \ />\n<strong
                          ><br \ />\nStew: <\/strong>It can seem sometimes that
                          the women in horror only embody the Madonna\/Whore
                          complex, and that men have their own Cunt\/Hero
                          division. It\u2019s actually not as straightforward as
                          that. When those tropes crop it\u2019s usually for
                          reasons concerning the practicalities of how horror
                          works &#8211; there is a need for heroes and
                          villains.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_8563\"

                              >Tom:<\/strong> Horror doesn&#8217;t often have a
                              lot of time to spend developing sophisticated
                              characterisation, and uses shorthands as a result.
                              The most obvious and irritating stereotype is the
                              angel of the house, or the innocent virgin, the
                              best example being Lucy Westenra in Bram
                              Stoker\u2019s
                              <strong
                                >Dracula<\/strong>. The character\u2019s common
                                in older Grand Guignol, though as the plays grew
                                more sophisticated they\u2019re increasingly
                                rare. It\u2019s simply because, for fairly
                                obvious reasons, if you want people to be upset
                                about a character being destroyed then you want
                                that character to be someone they feel
                                positively towards. In the early 20th century,
                                the easiest way to do that was to bring in a
                                nice, sweet posh girl who was rather inept, so
                                you get a lot of them.<\/p>\n
                                <p>

                                    >Stew:<\/strong> Another common one is the
                                    Hag, which crops up not just in the Grand
                                    Guignol but throughout horror. As we found
                                    out fairly recently, she\u2019s the proto
                                    form of the psycho-biddy, which is a major
                                    horror cinema trope, starting with

                                      >Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?<\/strong>
                                      The hag figures in Grand Guignol, as in a
                                      lot of literature before that from <a
                                      href=\"http:\/\/www.english.cam.ac.uk\/spenser\/main.htm\">Spenser<\/a>
                                      onwards, are generally suggested to be
                                      women who have rejected their femininity
                                      &#8211; women who have become masculinised
                                      in some way or are specifically
                                      anti-maternal: they eat children, they
                                      destroy children. That\u2019s a figure
                                      that goes back right through literature
                                      and myth. The Grand Guignol used that
                                      history together with figures from
                                      contemporary Paris: brothel madams and
                                      drunks and women who for other reasons
                                      were seen as no longer trading in the
                                      economies of sex.<\/p>\n

                                          >Tom:<\/strong> The evil women in
                                          Grand Guignol can be really fun
                                          &#8211; and they\u2019re often
                                          interesting characters. Let\u2019s
                                          face it, there are no great characters
                                          in the Grand Guignol, or in horror
                                          generally- it\u2019s not going to
                                          contain Hamlet. So a slightly
                                          stereotyped but also powerful and
                                          charismatic figure is often about as
                                          exciting and interesting a part as any
                                          man or woman is going to get in this
                                          kind of material.<\/p>\n
