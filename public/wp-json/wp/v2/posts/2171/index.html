    >A few snapshots of different sorts of feminists, their families and the
    festive season. I\u2019m fortunate to have lots of lovely people in my
    circle, many of whom identify as feminists and I was interested in what
    their Christmases looked like. <\/em><\/p>\n

            >TELL ME A BIT ABOUT YOURSELF.<\/strong><\/p>\n
            <p>
              My name is Oli.\u00a0 I&#8217;m a man, and I&#8217;m
              self-identified as a thinker, a pluralist and a liberal socialist
              rather than a feminist per se. I am all about equality for
              everyone &#8211; my feminism, such as it is, is an acknowledgement
              of a need to redress an imbalance of power and privilege across
              gender lines and a desire to be aware of the privilege I have by
              accident of birth and not be insensible to it or frankly abuse
              it.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              I do think that a lot of how I feel about gender and society has
              sprung from my exposure to feminist ideas and discourse through my
              family, social and academic life, not to mention an ongoing
              interest in engaging with the society I live in. I suppose I would
              characterise where I come from on the spectrum as really a
              post-feminist or a &#8220;sex-positive&#8221; feminist. I&#8217;m
              about to get married and shortly thereafter I&#8217;m going to be
              a father. I am happier now, in my mid-thirties and planning a life
              with someone, than I have ever been. \u00a0This is in no small
              part due to that person being as equally broad-minded, open and
              thinking a woman as I try to be a man.<\/p>\n

                <p>
                  We&#8217;re planning a quiet, family orientated Christmas with
                  my fiancee&#8217;s family in rural Sussex &#8211; I am looking
                  forward to it immensely!\u00a0 There will be food, drink,
                  boardgames, Christmas telly, and most importantly from my
                  perspective, a sense of togetherness. \u00a0We will (briefly)
                  celebrate again with my family on the eve of our upcoming
                  wedding when they get back into the country from spending
                  Christmas with my brother and sister-in-law in Belgium.<\/p>\n

                      A Kindle for my parents, a laptop for my partner, an array
                      of games\/DVDs\/CDs\/books\/hats and gloves for various
                      siblings &#8211; that kind of thing.<\/p>\n

                          About half and half online and in the shops &#8211; we
                          have done most of it together.<\/p>\n

                              I suppose more than anything I would want to avoid
                              cliche with regard to roles in the &#8220;Family
                              Christmas&#8221; &#8211; there is no reason for
                              just the women to cook and the men to socialise
                              &#8211; but to be frank my lifelong experience of
                              Christmas has been my father cooking Christmas
                              dinner, in fact dealing with all things distaff
                              over the festive period, so to avoid cliche I
                              would have to inhabit my own personal one.<\/p>\n
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              This year in particular I will be a guest in
                              another family&#8217;s idea of Christmas, and
                              while I want to be true to how I feel about all
                              kinds of things, like not just defaulting to
                              giving little girls &#8220;something pink&#8221;
                              to fighting over the washing up instead of just
                              doing it, I am aware of the fact that I need to
                              bend in the wind of another family&#8217;s
                              prevailing wind, if you&#8217;ll pardon the
                              dreadful imagery.<\/p>\n
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Tradition has a funny way of entrenching the most
                              trivial gender bias to the most insidious
                              prejudice; I suppose the particular pressure I
                              feel whenever Tradition weighs in, as it does
                              heavily at Christmas, is to not let it force me or
                              allow anyone else to behave in a way that is
                              inappropriate.<\/p>\n

                                  There are many groups of people that get a
                                  pause for thought, at least, from me at
                                  Christmas; the old, the lonely, the homeless,
                                  and in amongst that I would have to say women
                                  who have to be all things to all people over
                                  this period, all the way through to the women
                                  spending what should be a happy time filled
                                  with love and family, running and hiding from
                                  abuse. But as with any other &#8220;time of
                                  year&#8221; or similar, I always find myself
                                  chiding myself for not thinking of such things
                                  just on any old Tuesday a bit more often.
                                  \u00a0I suppose what I want to say is that
                                  Christmas being a time for reflection as well
                                  as joy is a bit of a double-edged sword; after
                                  all, a social conscience of any stripe should
                                  be for life, right?<\/p>\n<div
