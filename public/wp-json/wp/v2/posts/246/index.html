  Ripping the piss out of women\u2019s magazines and their litany of \u201cget

      It\u2019s buried beneath a ton of heteronormative guff of course, and

        1) Never underestimate the importance of being
        \u2018interesting\u2019.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        You owe it to yourself (and the men you date) to have a life of your
        own. So find some hobbies. In my mid-twenties, I made a guy my hobby.
        When he dumped me, partly because he felt smothered, I had to get a
        life\u2026 Now, when I\u2019m on a date and I read the menu in an
        Italian accent, or I smile when I talk about my ballet class, guys
        really eat it up.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n
      </p>
      <p>I say:<\/p>\n</p>
      <p>Never underestimate the importance of being interesting.<\/p>\n</p>
      <p>
        Sigh. Where do I even start with this one? Don\u2019t be interesting for
        \u2018the men you date\u2019, be interesting for the sake of the rest of
        humanity. It\u2019ll be better for you too, I promise &#8211; it
        irritates me when I think of all the hours I spent a decade ago trying
        to look beautiful when I could have been doing things I actually enjoyed
        instead. Being interesting lasts longer than beauty and it will win you
        friends as well as lovers.<\/p>\n

        <p>
          I used to fall into this bad habit of extreme flirting by teasing. One
          time, I told an older guy who\u2019d had a skiing accident that he was
          \u2018damaged goods\u2019, and I\u2019d need to trade him in for a
          \u2018younger model\u2019. He looked at me like I\u2019d just kicked

          I can see the sense of this one, I\u2019ve fallen into a similar habit
          myself. The right kind of teasing is plenty fun of course, but if
          you\u2019re in any kind of relationship with someone then the very
          least you can do is be careful with their feelings.<\/p>\n

              I see now that it would have won me points. When I was 21, I said

              I boil water?\u201d She told me \u201cMake it bubble.\u201d And,
              for years, that was all I knew how to do. If I\u2019d had any idea
              how much men savour a woman who cooks \u2013 even if they\u2019re
              great cooks themselves \u2013 I would\u2019ve asked for more

              OK, EVERYONE who is physically and mentally capable of doing so

                  True, I think. You can convince yourself of virtually anything
                  if you want it badly enough, or the truth is too painful to
                  admit. In my experience you will go on believing it until
                  something shakes you out of it but that\u2019s not very
                  advice-y. So, um: try and be honest with yourself and get a
                  second opinion from someone you trust. And eat lots of fruit
                  and veg.<\/p>\n

                            Sometimes people flirt because it makes them feel
                            good about themselves.<\/p>\n

                            In other news: sometimes people don\u2019t mean what
                            they say. If they are wearing a Slytherin scarf or
                            an eye-patch you should be particularly
                            careful.<\/p>\n

                              Some of them will settle down before you. Mine
                              have been getting married steadily for the past
                              decade. At some point, I started to feel
                              different, and that was a new and uncomfortable
                              feeling for me. Rather than get anxious about it,
                              I\u2019ve tried to remind myself that it\u2019s
                              not a race. Even if you\u2019ve always been first
                              in buying a flat or landing your dream career, you
                              could be the last in
                              marrying.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n

                              Don\u2019t compare yourself to your friends, or to
                              people on TV, in Tesco or in women\u2019s
                              magazines.<\/p>\n

                              Because you\u2019re different people, remember?
                              They have this habit of doing different things, at
                              different times and for different reasons. And
                              more importantly, beware of women\u2019s magazine
                              articles that insinuate that marriage is the goal
                              of everyone\u2019s life, and that if there are no
                              nuptial omens in your tea leaves then you should
                              feel anxious. Bullshit.<\/p>\n<div
