        In terms of consumption and emotional language, the pop song occupies a
        similar status to the sonnet. Well, not exactly, but certainly for the
        purpose of romance or desire, pop lyrics are an absolute boon for the
        tongue-tied (a group which includes &#8220;most of the English
        population&#8221;). They&#8217;re used to express whatever happens to be
        lurking unformed in the minds of the listener, and as a point of
        identification when the lurking stuff has been given a concrete
        identity.<\/p>\n

        Reams have been written about the depiction of women in pop music by
        male songwriters and the presentation of women by the music industry,
        but recently I was having a wee listen to PJ Harvey (while drunk in
        someone&#8217;s living room in Portsmouth on a Saturday night, because I
        am very cool) and it occurred to me that I&#8217;d not seen as much on
        the subject of how female desire&#8217;s presented in pop songs BY
        WOMEN.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        This thought came up because
        <strong
          >This Is Love<\/strong> felt like an anomaly: it presented desire as
          active on the part of the female narrator. PJ Harvey&#8217;s persona
          for the song has sexual agency, and longings that do not centre around
          waiting for someone else to make a move. She uses the phrase &#8220;I
          want&#8221; and backs it up with action: &#8220;to chase you round the
          table, wanna touch your head&#8221;, and in that &#8220;wanna touch
          your&#8221; she rather casually and without fuss flips the entire
          common model of heterosexual desire on its head by pointing out that
          women also want to touch, as well as being touched.<\/p>\n

            It shouldn&#8217;t sound unusual, and yet at the time of listening
            it was borderline revolutionary, at least to me. There are other
            lines from the song which imply action: &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe
            that the axis turns on suffering when you taste so good&#8221;;
            suggestive of all kinds of sexual acts, instigated by and controlled
            by the narrator, but nothing else is quite as direct as that
            seemingly harmless &#8220;wanna touch your head&#8221;.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong
              >This Is Love<\/strong> is not unique, but on examination it
              becomes harder to find other songs which inhabit the same active,
              instigating desire.<\/p>\n

                <strong
                  >I Just Wanna Make Love To You<\/strong> does, but even the
                  Divinyls&#8217; famously salacious anthem to female
                  masturbation and banned song
                  <strong
                    >I Touch Myself<\/strong> is self-contained sexuality; the
                    desire is there, but it is self-directed. The narrator says
                    nothing of what she wants to do to the object of the song,
                    only what the thought of him makes her do to herself!<\/p>\n
                    <p>
                      <iframe

                    <p>
                      Interestingly, when the object of desire is no longer
                      male, the desire becomes more active in its expression:
                      contentious and open to a variety of interpretations, Katy
                      Perry&#8217;s
                      <strong
                        >I Kissed A Girl<\/strong> does at least carry the flow
                        of action from the narrator to her object of desire:
                        Katy KISSED a girl, rather than being kissed BY a girl,
                        as so many heroines of pop songs are kissed BY a boy
                        rather than kissing him.<\/p>\n

                        <p>
                          In a song of the same name, Jill Sobule&#8217;s
                          narrator makes the same distinction: Jill KISSES
                          Jenny, the narrator as the actor rather than the
                          acted-upon.<\/p>\n
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          This is a small sample to draw a conclusion from, but
                          it is intriguing that female desire is more acceptable
                          as active, instigating, and potentially dominant when
                          the object of the woman&#8217;s desire is also female.
                          The repurposing of songs originally intended for male
                          singers often underscores this, as in Patti
                          Smith&#8217;s cover of
                          <strong

                            <p>
                              There are songs with male narrators in which the
                              instigation of action is undertaken by the female
                              half of the heterosexual proto-couple (usually
                              because the narrator is far too shy or lacking in
                              confidence, rather than because of any societal
                              prohibition on his asking her out): the main
                              contender in this category is <a

                                casual glance over popular music seems to reveal
                                far more male references to female desire
                                (&#8220;she wants me&#8221;) than female
                                references to female desire (&#8220;I want
                                him&#8221;).<\/p>\n

                                  PJ Harvey is not, of course, the first or only
                                  female artist to sing about desire. Ani
                                  Difranco has filled several albums with
                                  heartfelt songs cataloging the effects of
                                  desire on the psyche: primarily in the
                                  aftermath. Ani writes about regret or lack
                                  thereof, but rarely if at all about the
                                  white-hot moment of simple wanting.<\/p>\n

                                      this must qualify for a candid and
                                      unabashed demonstration of naked female
                                      desire?<\/p>\n

                                        Well, yes and no. Riot Grrrl has an
                                        agenda which is unshy of communicating,
                                        and sexuality is, as all other aspects
                                        of feminine experience, politicised. The
                                        song itself discusses internal obstacles
                                        to feeling and acting upon desire, the
                                        ubquity of rape, and the &#8220;radical
                                        possibilities of pleasure&#8221;, which
                                        while a notable feminist sentiment on
                                        the reclamation of sexuality, is a far
                                        cry from Harvey&#8217;s &#8220;I just
                                        want to sit here and watch you
                                        undress&#8221;. Politicised recognition
                                        of the rightness of female desire and
                                        its value is highly important, but
                                        isn&#8217;t quite the same thing as an
                                        unselfconscious expression of that
                                        desire.<\/p>\n

                                          driven: it is potent, referencing
                                          power and femininity, but ultimately

                                              the general idea is clear. That
