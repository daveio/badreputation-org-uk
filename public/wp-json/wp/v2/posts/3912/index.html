  \u201cGreat brands tell stories. They\u2019re a mix of truth and
  symbols.\u201d Brand strategist Alison Camps kicked off the\u00a0<a
  title=\"IGRS - ReBranding Feminism\"
  href=\"http:\/\/igrs.sas.ac.uk\/index.php?id=482\">(Re)Branding Feminism<\/a>
  conference on 1st March with an introduction to the concept of branding, and
  some examples from her career. The one she selected as a case study with
  particular relevance for feminism was Skoda in the early 1990s: the
  \u201cbrand from hell.\u201d<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  The conference was very firmly about considering representations of modern
  feminism and not making plans about how best to \u2018sell\u2019 feminism to
  the masses. I\u2019m a persuader by trade, so I have a practical interest in
  how best to present feminism to an indifferent, sceptical or rabidly hostile
  audience. But I also love my gender theory, so a spot of academic inquiry made
  a nice change from activism, and I was sad I could only attend the first
  day.<\/p>\n
</p>
<h3>
  Mothers and daughters and sisters, oh my!<\/h3>\n
  <p>
    My favourite paper was Jean Owen\u2019s \u2018Of feminism born\u2019, which
    looked at the prevalence and problems of using familial metaphors in the
    feminist movement. The political concept of sisterhood began as a strategy
    of resistance to masculine structures of patriarchy and
    \u2018brotherhood\u2019. It is undeniably powerful, especially for women
    that have experienced the isolation of being the lone feminist voice in
    their community. But sisterhood has become a \u201cuniversalising
    metaphor\u201d that \u201cimplies an all-encompassing, somewhat stifling
    organisation\u201d. And now that feminism is intergenerational, parental
    hierarchies have re-emerged &#8211; we are not only sisters but cultural
    mothers and daughters of feminism.<\/p>\n
  </p>
  <p>
    Through this way of talking about ourselves, Owen argued, we risk
    \u201cpandering to fantasies of a matriarchy\u201d and create a falsely
    cosy, sentimentalised idea of what is in reality a diverse and radical
    movement. In my experience, contemporary feminism already has tremendous
    respect for previous generations, but by formalising it in this way we
    undermine our own project of equality and put in place privileged feminist
    \u2018bloodlines\u2019. Owen advises that \u201cwe need to remove ourselves
    from the trap of family\u201d and predicate our movement on a \u201cmore
    involved social model\u201d.<\/p>\n
  </p>
  <p>
    I agree with all of this. In fact, my main problems with
    \u2018sisterhood\u2019 are that this language pretty definitively excludes
    men and reinforces the gender binary that I want to dismantle. That&#8217;s
    a long-term goal, by the way. Short-term is sorting out some of the urgent
    problems in the current system.<\/p>\n
  </p>
  <h3>
    Selling feminism<\/h3>\n
    <p>
      Catherine Redfern (of
      <strong
        ><a title=\"Reclaiming the F Word\"
        href=\"http:\/\/www.reclaimingthefword.net\/\">Reclaiming the F
        Word<\/a><\/strong>, and, um, <a title=\"The F Word\"
        href=\"http:\/\/www.thefword.org.uk\/\">The F Word<\/a> fame) spoke
        about the cyclical nature of calls to rebrand feminism, which can be
        measured in women\u2019s magazine features. The call makes a couple of
        big assumptions: that feminism is in\u00a0crisis and that applying
        marketing principles will help.<\/p>\n
        <p>
          Redfern calmly exploded the first theory by referencing the research
          for her book with Kristin Aune which showed that feminism is a
          growing, thriving movement, and questioned the second. Mainstream
          representations of feminism are too narrow, and don\u2019t reflect the
          pluralism of the movement. But the F Word survey showed that women
          became feminists when they learned about feminism, and not when it was
          packaged with a free lipgloss. Who is a feminist because it\u2019s
          fashionable? Surely we are insulting young women somewhat by trying to
          package it as something \u2018cool\u2019.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          The other papers were very interesting, and included a brief history
          of the stiletto heel, a smart analysis of those <a title=\"BBC News\"
          href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-england-london-11797066\">Suit
          Supply ads<\/a> and the \u2018desire of indifference\u2019 and an
          introduction to the <a title=\"Wikipedia - Nell Brinkley\"
          href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nell_Brinkley\">Brinkley
          Girl<\/a>. But the only one which directly commented on the idea of
          \u2018branding\u2019 feminism was from Catherine Maffioletti, who made
          some good points about the tension between the \u201cwild and
          divided\u201d nature of feminism and the patriarchal (and capitalist)
          project of naming and fixing its meaning in a saleable product. As
          Maffioletti said, \u201cbranding difference is an impossible
          project\u201d. Feminism is \u201cemergent\u201d, \u201ca mobilising
          force\u201d, something alive and oppositional that can\u2019t be
          pinned down, boxed up and sold.<\/p>\n

        <h3>
          I&#8217;m not a marketer, but&#8230;<\/h3>\n
          <p>
            As the day went on I started to feel the burden of pragmatism
            weighing on my shoulders and spoiling the fun, as it often does.
            There\u2019s a little voice inside me always wanting to know: what
            are we going to
            <em
              >do<\/em> about this? What\u2019s the
              <em
                >plan<\/em>? That\u2019s not what the conference was about, but
                I started wondering about practical applications.<\/p>\n
                <p>
                  I think a serious attempt to \u2018rebrand\u2019 feminism
                  would be madness, because it
                  <em
                    >is<\/em> \u201cwild and divided\u201d; it\u2019s plural and
                    adaptable, and means too many different things to too many
                    people, and I\u2019m nearly ready to argue that\u2019s one
                    of its strengths. As Catherine Redfern pointed out, feminism
                    is a leaderless grassroots movement; who would have the
                    audacity to try and redefine it?<\/p>\n
                    <p>
                      But I reckon that as individual feminists and as groups of
                      feminists, we could do a lot more to broaden
                      representations of feminism, to counter the negative
                      stereotypes, to make the case more effectively without
                      letting the end run away with the means.<\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      You don\u2019t have to call it marketing. It\u2019s as
                      simple as putting yourself in someone else\u2019s shoes,
                      understanding their criticisms and concerns and addressing
                      them, learning what they want, and showing them how you
                      can help.<\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Or if that sounds too cuddly, you can call it
                      propaganda.<\/p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy
