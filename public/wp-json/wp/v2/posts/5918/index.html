<p>
  I\u2019ve just read a book on cars. It&#8217;s called <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/Girls-Car-Handbook-Everything-About\/dp\/1847392156\"><strong
    >The Girls\u2019 Car Handbook: Everything You Need to Know about Life on the
    Road<\/strong><\/a>. It was pink, and had a purple convertible on the
    cover.<\/p>\n
    <p>
      On the surface of it, I am this book\u2019s target audience. I passed my
      test recently (send plaudits and flowers to the usual address), and was
      immediately filled with the urge to run out and buy a car. Not a simple,
      sensible car that can lug my marshalling gear from racetrack to racetrack,
      or even a smart, neat little city runabout to get me to meetings on time.

      an <a
      href=\"http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/motoring\/motor-shows\/geneva-motor-show\/8355162\/Geneva-motor-show-Alfa-Romeo-4C-to-go-on-sale-in-2012.html\">Alfa
      4C<\/a>. It\u2019s not even out yet. They&#8217;re only making a handful
      of them, and they&#8217;ve probably all already been sold. I wouldn\u2019t
      be able to afford the deposit, let alone the monthly repayments, let alone
      the insurance, let alone keeping it fed and watered on UK oil prices.
      It\u2019s not a car, it\u2019s petrolhead pornography.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Couple the above unnatural lust with a penchant for heels and pearls, and
      surely I would jump for joy at a book with a back cover featuring a girl
      in a miniskirt and thigh-high purple boots bending over a car? Why, add a
      tasteful hair accessory or two and it could even be me!<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyway, the pertinent point is that I did indeed read it (albeit borrowed
      from the library rather than sending my hard-earned cash to the pink
      publisher). Not just little bits. The whole damn thing, cover to cover.
      And I hate to say it, but I think the writer has been stitched up.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      I\u2019ve read
      <strong
        >Maria McCarthy<\/strong>\u2019s columns in the
        <strong
          >Telegraph<\/strong>, and went in, despite the cover, expecting much
          the same: sensible journalism with an eye to problems faced by female
          drivers. It&#8217;s&#8230; not that. It&#8217;s actually rather
          like\u00a0 \u2013 and when I say \u2018like\u2019, I mean \u2018this
          is what I reckon happened&#8217; \u2013 someone took McCarthy\u2019s
          manuscript, looked at the proposed cover, and said, \u201cthis should
          have more \u2018girlie\u2019 things in it.\u201d And then picked up
          the editing pen and wrote in said girlie things, whether they made
          sense or not.<\/p>\n
          <p>
            For example, McCarthy opens her chapter on car insurance
            thus:<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              <em
                >Sorting out car insurance can be a bewildering experience for
                many of us.<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n
                <p>
                  Except she doesn\u2019t. What actually opens the chapter, in
                  full, is:<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <blockquote>

                      sorting out your car insurance is right up there with
                      filling in tax returns, going for gynaecological check-ups
                      or visiting dreary in-laws. But as with all these
                      experiences, the best approach is just to grit your teeth,
                      remind yourself that it\u2019ll be over soon and plan a
                      nice treat for afterwards.<\/em><br \ />\n<em

                        <p>
                          Yes, that\u2019s right. It reads like someone went
                          back in and added in an additional, wholly unnecessary
                          introductory paragraph. It doesn\u2019t stop there. On

                                                    I have a strong feeling that
                                                    if Maria McCarthy is ever
                                                    presented with any of these

                                                    it is used. The pink car
                                                    wash kit will be useless in
                                                    actually washing a car,
