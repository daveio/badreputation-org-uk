  I was walking home recently, across a busy bit of central London, after dark,
  when some dude made kissy noises at me, like he was trying to tempt a cat. He
  was two feet away, staring straight at me and smirking like an icky
  weasel.<\/p>\n

<p>
  Without thinking, I responded in kind with a big, angry,

    <p>He looked pretty taken aback.<\/p>\n</p>
    <p>
      I carried on my way and mused that I appear to speak feline like a
      mothertongue, but also I got to thinking: what the ever-loving crap?!
      Seriously, what on earth was he expecting from that encounter? What would
      a positive result have been? Surely that&#8217;s
      <em
        >never<\/em> worked for anyone, right?<\/p>\n
        <p>
          Ah, street harassment. It&#8217;s been a few months. Usually my
          experience of you is relegated to when I&#8217;m wearing a summer
          dress (gender norms for the lose) but it sucks whenever it happens.
          It&#8217;s also antithetical to ever actually
          <em
            >getting<\/em> my interest because &#8211; no matter how many mad
            cat-lady vibes I&#8217;ve got going on &#8211; no one who thinks
            they can approach me like a pet is getting the time of day.<\/p>\n
            <p>
              This particular encounter didn&#8217;t throw me much because I
              actually had a comeback &#8211; I walked away pleased with myself
              for thinking fast &#8211; but how you deflect it shouldn&#8217;t
              be the first point of call. WHY DO PEOPLE DO THIS?<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              Far more often it&#8217;s crap shouted from cars &#8211; which I
              find rubbish twice over because they&#8217;ve gone before you can
              say or do anything in response. (Come back right now, dudebro. I
              have a LOT to say about what you just did.)<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              A friend of mine recently had some jerk shout &#8220;nice
              tits!&#8221; at her from a car. She was (understandably) angry and
              upset for the rest of the day, but the guy shouting it might have
              told himself it was a compliment &#8211; some <a title=\"Jezebel

              with street harassers<\/a> have revealed what is either complete
              ignorance or willing ignorance of the effect it has on women. Many
              of the men, when asked why they do it, say it&#8217;s a compliment
              and it makes women feel nice.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              Maybe it is a compliment for a very small percentage of people
              &#8211; I cannot claim to speak for everybody &#8211; but I am yet
              to meet or hear of one person who&#8217;s had a catcall,
              wolf-whistle or similar and felt good about it. The thing about
              street harassment is, it&#8217;s not flirting. Street harassment
              doesn&#8217;t make a person feel good because it isn&#8217;t about
              a person: it&#8217;s boiling them down to their physical
              attributes (&#8216;nice tits&#8217;, &#8216;nice ass&#8217;) and
              funnily enough that doesn&#8217;t feel great.<\/p>\n<div

              The other thing is, it&#8217;s almost never a conversation: mostly
              &#8217;cause the objects of the harassment
              <strong
                >aren&#8217;t interested<\/strong> and want to get on with their
                day, and also because often it&#8217;s at a remove &#8211; stuff
                shouted from cars, or (to use the clich\u00e9) from scaffolding.
                The people doing the shouting don&#8217;t actually expect a
                response. This isn&#8217;t a tool used to chat up women:
                it&#8217;s used to silence them. Under the guise of a compliment
                it&#8217;s a one-way street of objectification.<\/p>\n
                <p>
                  And Objectification Street is a crappy street. Seriously, I
                  looked at a flat there once. There were rats all over the
                  place and it smelled bad.<\/p>\n

                  Of course, if people are physically closer to the harassers,
                  it doesn&#8217;t exactly get better. The wonderful (and

                    her. The police (who did intervene) then blamed her for
