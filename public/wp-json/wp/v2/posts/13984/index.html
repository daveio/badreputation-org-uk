<p>
  Jack the Ripper is kind of a big deal in East London. Whether it&#8217;s a
  plaque in a pub, a BBC film crew or yet another walking tour, he pops up all
  over the place with his spooky hat and cloak. And to be honest, it&#8217;s
  pretty tiresome.<\/p>\n

  Morbid stories<\/h3>\n

    Regular readers will know that I love history, and that murder mysteries are
    just one of my many morbid interests. When I first started seeing my
    boyfriend, I took him on a date to <a href=\"http:\/\/wiltons.org.uk\/\"
    target=\"_blank\">Wilton&#8217;s Music Hall<\/a> via Ratcliff Highway so I
    could tell him about the famous <a

    \/><\/a>So I get it, I do. The <a
    href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Whitechapel_murders\"
    target=\"_blank\">Whitechapel murders<\/a> of 1888 are grimly fascinating,
    and the question mark over the killer&#8217;s identity is a magnet for myths
    and stories. The study of the murders and their legacy illuminate the
    historical and the contemporary context in valuable ways. One example is
    Judith Walkowitz&#8217;s superb book, <a
    href=\"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/1184786.City_of_Dreadful_Delight\"
    target=\"_blank\"><b
      >City of Dreadful Delight<\/b><\/a>. And <a
      href=\"http:\/\/madameguillotine.org.uk\/2012\/01\/31\/feminism-and-jack-the-ripper-a-ramble-through-a-disordered-mind\/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Madame Guillotine<\/a> has a great post exploring her
      interest in Jack the Ripper as a feminist.<\/p>\n
      <p>
        But there are other tales we could tell. There are plenty of morbid
        stories to choose from (our other major historical export is <a
        title=\"Kray Twinc\"
        href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kray_twins\"
        target=\"_blank\">the Krays<\/a>) and it might even be nice to talk
        about some East London history that doesn&#8217;t involve murder.
        Although we know nothing about him, Jack the Ripper overshadows a cast
        of amazing East End characters, and the Whitechapel murders draw far
        more attention than any number of incredible events. Just one example:
        this year is also the 125<sup
          >th<\/sup> anniversary of the <a
          href=\"http:\/\/badreputation.org.uk\/2011\/09\/06\/revolting-women-the-matchgirls-strike-or-working-class-teenagers-kick-corporate-ass\/\"
          target=\"_blank\">Matchwomen&#8217;s strike<\/a> which launched the
          modern trade union movement. Thanks to the efforts of <a
          href=\"http:\/\/louiseraw.co.uk\/moreinformation.htm\"
          target=\"_blank\">Louise Raw<\/a>, there was a commemorative event at
          the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bishopsgate.org.uk\/\"
          target=\"_blank\">Bishopsgate Institute<\/a> and a bit of media
          coverage. But will we be tripping over Matchwomen walking tours in
          Bow?<\/p>\n
          <h3>
            Jack and his victims<\/h3>\n
            <p>
              It&#8217;s not just the extent of it but the tone. Jack the Ripper
              is everybody&#8217;s favourite mystery serial killer. There is
              endless speculation about his identity, his knowledge of anatomy
              and even admiration for his ability to evade capture. In contrast,
              the women he murdered are reduced to objects for study or criminal
              evidence for analysis.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              For example: my local paper recently contained a special 12 page
              Jack the Ripper supplement including a page entitled \u201cThe
              victims: How women met their gory deaths\u201d, featuring detailed
              descriptions of the last movements and mutilated bodies of five
              women who were murdered &#8211; Mary Ann Nichols, Annie Chapman,
              Lizzie Stride, Catherine Eddowes, Mary Jane Kelly &#8211; complete
              with pictures of their faces taken after death.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              Where is the respect for these women? Poring over details like how
              drunk they were and how deep the gash in their throat was or how
              their intestines were arranged may be one thing in a history book,
              but why is it being printed in the <a
              href=\"http:\/\/www.newhamrecorder.co.uk\/home\"
              target=\"_blank\"><strong
                >Newham Recorder<\/strong><\/a>, along with photographs of their
                corpses? I don&#8217;t want these intimate and gruesome details
                exhumed for my entertainment.<\/p>\n
                <h3>
                  Missing the big picture<\/h3>\n
                  <p>
                    Like almost all media coverage of the subject the article
                    fails to connect the Whitechapel murders to any kind of
                    context about violence against women then or now. Another
                    article highlights the fact that six other women were
                    murdered in the same area in the same year, three also
                    working in prostitution and killed by punters (Emma Smith,
                    Martha Tabram, Rose Mylett), three killed by their
                    husbands.<\/p>\n

                  <p>
                    Sadly this article reads like a masterclass in how to subtly
                    blame victims and excuse perpetrators when it describes the
                    three cases of women killed by their husbands &#8211; Hannah

                                    This is advice that is seriously but
                                    unhelpfully issued to women today in the
                                    guise of rape prevention. It is also a
                                    classic example of the victim blaming which
                                    prevents many women reporting violence let
                                    alone seeing their attacker convicted.
                                    Repeated in this context it&#8217;s
                                    ghoulish, and not in a good way.<\/p>\n

                                    are particularly vulnerable to violence
