            It should take no great mind to figure out that there is a
            relationship between\u00a0<em
              >pussy <\/em>and
              <em
                >puss<\/em>, right? The second is, as with so many -y words,
                a\u00a0diminutive\u00a0form of the first.<\/p>\n
                <p>
                  Etymologically,
                  <em
                    >puss<\/em> comes from a family of Germanic words, including
                    the Dutch &#8216;<em
                      >poes&#8217; <\/em>(= &#8216;cat&#8217;, or &#8216;a large
                      soft mass&#8217;), and this is one of those words that has
                      had a telling journey from its initial meaning to its
                      modern significance. In simple form, of course, it just
                      means &#8216;cat&#8217;, with a tendency towards the
                      proper name, as in
                      <em
                        >Puss In Boots. <\/em>The dictionary refines this to a
                        &#8216;call-name&#8217; or &#8216;nursery term&#8217;
                        for a cat, perhaps originating in the sort of &#8216;tsk
                        tsk tsk&#8217; noises even the most Serious People
                        inevitably make when seduced by the classic paws, ears

                          vagina&#8217;, specifically), with an attendant list
                          of seductive compounds and phrases:\u00a0<em

                                    meaning was &#8216;a girl or woman

                                    cat, especially sweetness or
                                    amiability&#8217; (1580s), where it could
                                    also be used as a term of endearment (<em

                                      &#8216;a sweet or effeminate man&#8217;.
                                      Only later does this degenerate into the

                                      the idea of &#8216;a domesticated

                                      presently). Of course, suggestions about
                                      sexuality are never far away from such

                                              of when and why cats became
                                              synonymous with all this, we must,
                                              as usual, ask another question:
                                              when and why did cats enter our
                                              everyday lives in the first place?
                                              It happened late: like so many
                                              modern phenomena,
                                              cats-as-companions were an
                                              eighteenth-century innovation.
                                              They had been knocking around
                                              before, of course, but primarily
                                              as pest control; those showing
                                              undue affection for their felines
                                              were considered, at best, as a bit
                                              eccentric, and, at worst, <a

                                              forces of Nature<\/a>. Dogs had
                                              had a bit more success elbowing
                                              their way into domesticity, due to
                                              their usefulness in hunting and
                                              their essential biddability, but
                                              even for them, the eighteenth

                                              See, it&#8217;s easy to forget the
                                              fear and awe this Nature lark
                                              could inspire in the centuries
                                              before efficient systems to keep
                                              it under &#8216;control&#8217;,
                                              and as the European traveller
                                              elbowed his way into Asian and
                                              American forests at the dawn of
                                              the Enlightenment, he must have
                                              felt he was asserting mastery over
                                              the very earth (along with the
                                              pesky native peoples already
                                              living there, of course). With
                                              confidence comes bravado, and this
                                              increasing satisfaction with
                                              Man&#8217;s superiority over the
                                              elements quickly sparked a fashion
                                              for adopting domestic creatures.
                                              And so it was that throughout the
                                              eighteenth century, cats were
                                              welcomed into the home partially
                                              as symbols of conquest (where they
                                              were painted, along with those
                                              Definite Symbols of
