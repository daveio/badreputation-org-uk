<p>
  A slight change from the usual format today as we look at two people. One a
  gifted writer and political activist, the other a folk-hero bringing together
  the deeds of many actual people into a single inspirational composite.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  Pre-Revolutionary Mexico was not a good place to be female. The Mexican Civil
  Code of 1884 strongly curtailed the rights of women at home and in the
  workplace, placing almost unbelievable restrictions on them compared to men.
  Between this and the heavy influence of the Catholic Church, President <a
  href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Porfirio_D%C3%ADaz\">Porfirio
  Diaz&#8217;s<\/a> regime was not one that fostered female freedom of
  expression. It&#8217;s perhaps not surprising, then, that young Mexican women
  were so keen to become involved in the revolutionary activities of the early
  20th century. Women like

      \/><\/a>Born in the small town of <a
      href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lerdo\">Lerdo<\/a> in 1896,
      Galindo was still young when Mexico began its long period of revolution in
      1910. This didn&#8217;t stop her from quickly becoming a political writer
      and advocate for <a
      href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Venustiano_Carranza\">Venustiano
      Carranza<\/a> &#8211; she was a gifted writer and public speaker,
      producing many political tracts. Following the removal of <a
      href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Victoriano_Huerta\">Victoriano
      Huerta<\/a>, Galdino gained Carranza&#8217;s attention whilst giving a
      speech to welcome him into the city. Recognising her eloquence, and the
      importance of having women support his cause, Carranza made her a part of
      his new government.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      As a part of Carranza&#8217;s government, Galindo pushed heavily for
      improvements to women&#8217;s rights. She argued for the provision of sex
      education and increased rights with regards to divorce, both topics that
      caused friction with the influential Catholic church. Indeed, Galindo
      repeatedly prompted controversy by openly opposing the social influence of
      the church and describing Catholicism as one of the main barriers to
      female progress in Mexico. Although unsuccesful, she also campaigned for
      female suffrage in Mexico.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Ultimately Galindo grew disillusioned with politics as it became apparent
      that Carranza would not bring about the changes she had hoped for, and as
      the corruption of the new regime grew more evident. Although she ceased to
      be politically active after 1919, her tactics, and the arguments she put
      forth in her journal,
      <strong
        >Mujer Moderna<\/strong>, would continue to be used by Mexican feminists
        of the &#8217;20s and &#8217;30s.<\/p>\n
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Hermila Galindo did not suffer imprisonment for expressing her
            ideas. However, she did have to face a great deal of hostility,
            scorn and ridicule from both men and women for expressing unpopular
            views and for speaking up on subjects which still remain taboo in
            Mexico. Her willingness to face strong opposition gave heart to the
            more advanced feminists of her own, and to the succeeding generation

                <p>
                  As well as the political contributions of women like Galindo,
                  the Mexican revolution saw many women taking part in the armed
                  conflict itself, known as the soldaderas (&#8216;soldier
                  women&#8217;). From their ranks emerged the figure of
                  <strong
                    >Adelita<\/strong>, almost certainly a composite of the
                    deeds of many different female soldiers. (Indeed, many of
                    her reported feats are mutually exclusive. <a
                    href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Josefina_Niggli\">Josefina
                    Niggli<\/a>&#8216;s play about the soldaderas shows Adelita
                    sacrificing herself to protect vital supplies from the
                    Federales early in the revolution, for example.)<\/p>\n
                    <p>
                      Adelita functions as something of a folk hero, an example
                      of bravery in combat and the extraordinary will to fight
                      for one&#8217;s cause. The term became something of a
                      label of courage in post-revolutionary Mexico: The young
                      Marisol Valles Garcia, for example, was nicknamed
                      &#8216;Adelita&#8217; after becoming the police chief of
                      one of Mexico&#8217;s most dangerous regions in late 2010,
                      a job no one else dared take.<\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Modern depictions of the Adelita figure vary, ranging from
                      the cold and efficient soldier, no different to her male
                      counterparts, through to a hypersexualised figure <a
                      href=\"http:\/\/www.ic.arizona.edu\/ic\/mcbride\/ws200\/mex-jand.htm\">reminiscent
                      of the pin-up girls<\/a> painted on American planes. This
                      contrasting representation is due in part to the
                      unfortunate lack of records regarding a lot of the actual
                      soldaderas, making it hard to know the true scope of their
                      activities and easy for later writers and artists to
                      impose their own spin on the tales of Adelita.<\/p>\n<div
