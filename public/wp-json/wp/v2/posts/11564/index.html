  There is an international organisation which protects abused children in a
  unique way.<br \ />\nThe alpha-masculinity of the men is honourable and has a
  positive effect on the community.<br \ />\nThe women in it are equals, fully
  involved in the work of being a physically intimidating deterrent.<\/p>\n

<p>Oh yes, and it&#8217;s a biker gang.<\/p>\n</p>

      >BACA &#8211; Bikers Against Child Abuse<\/strong><\/a>. The theory behind
      the group is simple, and works very well: if an abused child is scared of
      their attacker returning, if their home no longer feels like a safe haven,
      or if the outside world and school feel too exposed, their new family will
      stand guard for as long as they need.<\/p>\n

              >Bikers Against Child Abuse<\/strong> is a non-profit organisation
              started by a social worker in 1995. John Paul Lilly realised that
              the 8-year-old boy in his care was too scared to leave the house,
              and remembered what had successfully taken away his own fears as a
              child: having a biker gang look out for him. He developed
              safeguards and checks to make the idea work in a therapeutic
              environment, and now there are chapters in the United States,
              Canada, Australia, Italy, The Netherlands and Belgium. The details
              of precisely what they do are extraordinary.<\/p>\n
              <p>
                First of all, the child meets the whole local gang and becomes
                part of their family. They get the same t-shirt as the gang.
                They get a biker name. They are under no doubt that these men
                and women will be there for them from now on. For the bikers,
                this involves training from qualified social workers and
                discipline from their leader around how they behave during that
                first meeting.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <p>
                  I don&#8217;t want to see any tears coming out of your eyes,
                  and the child doesn&#8217;t either. Remember why we&#8217;re
                  here: to empower the child. If you can&#8217;t handle it, keep
                  your shades on.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  After that, two bikers are assigned as the child&#8217;s
                  &#8220;Primaries&#8221;. (Always two, and no biker is ever
                  alone with a child &#8211; two is the minimum number at any
                  meeting and parents\/guardian must give permission each time
                  as well). They will be on call, a mobile number the child can
                  ring whenever they need to. And that&#8217;s important,
                  because being present and being seen (especially by the child)
                  is what they&#8217;re there for.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    If the man who hurt this little girl calls or drives by, or
                    even if she is just scared, another nightmare, the bikers
                    will ride over and stand guard all night. &#8230; if she has
                    to testify against her abuser in court, they will go, too,
                    walking with her to the witness stand and taking over the
                    first row of seats. (They) will tell her, &#8220;Look at us,
                    not him.&#8221; And when she&#8217;s done, they will circle
                    her again and walk her out.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The emphasis is always on keeping the child safe from fear,
                    of being a wall of friends between them and the influences
                    making them feel vulnerable. And it works, again and
                    again.<\/p>\n
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I&#8217;ve written for BadRep before about how
                    society&#8217;s definition of &#8216;manliness&#8217; <a
                    href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/2010\/12\/16\/big-dog\/\"
                    target=\"_blank\">STILL involves violence and requires
                    complete isolation from anything feminine<\/a>, and how this
                    obviously doesn&#8217;t help feminism (or indeed men). But
                    there are also many other aspects of alpha-maleness which
                    directly harm men, women and equality. Male aggression is
                    (rightly) regarded as often negative in modern life, and we
                    haven&#8217;t come up with new ways of valuing masculinity
                    since the office worker replaced the hunter and
                    warrior.<\/p>\n
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The challenge facing these bikers is exactly the same as for
                    anyone trying to be a White Knight in the modern age:
                    it&#8217;s a very, very narrow and fragile path to stay on.
                    These men and women are valued because of their capability
                    for violence, at least by reputation. Their quiet physical
                    intimidation is precisely what makes them useful to society,
                    and that&#8217;s actually a rare role these days.<\/p>\n
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But a successful warrior is defined only by being the best
                    at combat. If any warrior loses the approval of the
                    community due to being untrustworthy, indiscriminate in who
                    they attack or just out of control, then they become a rabid
                    dog who needs to be contained for the safety of others. A
                    superhero only has the public cheering them on in fights if
                    they don&#8217;t take cheap shots, attack a child, injure
                    the defenceless, or any number of things which can break
                    their honourable image.<\/p>\n
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the same way, these bikers cannot be seen to be harmful
                    to the children, aggressive to the public or openly criminal
                    &#8211; not one of them, not even once. This charity (which
                    I approve of and respect so much I was nearly moved to
                    tears) works only until the first biker breaks that trust.
                    What this means in the real world is that there are
                    incredibly tight restrictions on how these particular alpha
                    males can channel their masculine image, forcing them to be
                    extremely honourable at all times. It sets up a rare
                    situation where private individuals on the street following
                    their own decisions (not soldiers following orders in an
                    army) are able to display all the violent alpha male traits
                    which usually <a
                    href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/2010\/12\/15\/alpha-malaise\/\">result
                    in problems<\/a> for society, and use them to create trust,
                    healing and safety from fear.<\/p>\n
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I thought this post was a good fit for BadRep not because
                    I&#8217;m under any impression that biker gangs are bastions
                    of feminism and equality &#8211; I know nothing about it,
                    but expect that any chapters led by women are in the vast
                    minority and regarded differently. But while all the women
                    in the article were treated as equals in a family, this time
                    it was the role of the men I particularly wanted to
                    mention.<\/p>\n
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The article describes such an atmosphere of caring, security
                    and trust between these bikers and the children that
                    it&#8217;s made many readers into instant converts. I can
                    totally believe that this approach would work on even the
                    most terrified brain &#8211; anything coming for the victim
                    will now have to go through their big friends first.
                    It&#8217;s a real-world solution which lets children sleep
                    at night, and I love that both women and men are out there
                    doing it with such selfless dedication on their own time and
                    at their own expense. (In the article, two bikers stay on
                    watch outside a girl&#8217;s house from 8pm until 2am, when
                    two more arrive to take the next shift. In another example
                    this rolling watch is kept up continuously for two and a
                    half days, by people travelling two hours to get there.)

                    An online friend of mine and her husband are members of <a
                    href=\"http:\/\/www.patriotguard.org\/\"
                    target=\"_blank\">The Patriot Guard<\/a>, bikers in the US
                    who (strictly at the invitation of the family) will attend
                    funerals of servicemen to protect the event from protesters
                    such as the Westboro Baptist Church. (The WBC picket
                    funerals of LGBT personnel, shouting that God killed them
                    because of their sexuality.) It&#8217;s precisely the same
                    thing: bikers using their image to &#8211; when invited
                    &#8211; protect the emotionally vulnerable. It&#8217;s a
                    hugely positive way to use alpha male traits in the modern
                    world.<\/p>\n
