      As a right-thinking feminist, or an engaged human being, or a person who
      occasionally glances at the news, you may recently have heard about Nadine
      Dorries\u2019 proposed amendment to the Health and Social Care Bill. It
      would have provided something deemed \u2018independent counselling\u2019
      for women seeking an abortion. It may well have made you feel irritable
      for a while.<\/p>\n

      \/><\/a>It was an amendment so controversial it succeeded in distracting
      rather a lot of attention from the substantive bill, which could probably
      have borne a little scrutiny itself. The public reaction in the UK to the
      Dorries amendment was loud and it was largely scathing. A woman
      shouldn\u2019t have to argue or debate with independent counsellors before
      availing herself of her legal rights, and any move towards such a position
      must be opposed.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      The amendment was soundly defeated, and we all continued to live in a
      country where women are permitted to have reproductive rights without
      begging for them. Hurrah.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      But imagine a world where Dorries\u2019 amendment was passed, and then, if
      you\u2019re brave, imagine a world where reproductive rights were rolled
      back entirely. It\u2019s like a John Lennon song, but completely
      different. Now imagine living in a theocracy, or the remnants of one.
      Imagine finding out you were pregnant and knowing you didn\u2019t want a
      child and having to accept that legally, the only thing you could do is
      leave your country and find one that could provide a safe and legal
      abortion, carried out by people who have had medical training. What sort
      of dystopia is this, you ask?<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      This is Ireland, of course, a one hour flight away. It\u2019s where I grew
      up.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Abortion is illegal in Ireland. If you want one, you will need to obtain
      one in Britain. Simple as that.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a law, like so many, that discriminates on the basis of personal
      wealth and privilege. If you have options, education, confidence, access
      to a computer and a credit card, you can book an appointment for a private
      abortion in the UK and then you can book a flight. But if you don\u2019t
      have these things you will struggle. Let\u2019s be clear about this
      &#8211; you will require money. A return flight is the better part of one
      hundred pounds. An early abortion will cost about four hundred pounds. A
      later term abortion, all the more likely if you have struggled to access
      services or figure out how to book or fund an appointment without
      assistance or support of any kind, will cost significantly more.<\/p>\n

      href=\"http:\/\/www.abortionsupport.org.uk\/\"><strong
        >Abortion Support Network<\/strong><\/a>, which I discovered eighteen
        months ago during the inconvenient eruption of Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull and
        the subsequent Great Ash Cloud of 2010. The resulting disruption of
        flights was a nuisance to many, but to those who had booked a private
        abortion in the UK, it was potentially disastrous. Forced to rebook
        their appointment and their flights, and in some cases forced to now
        book a later term \u2013 and therefore more expensive \u2013 abortion,
        many found themselves in desperate need of financial assistance. The
        Abortion Support Network supplies a non-judgemental ear, but more
        importantly, practical help: a place to stay in a foreign country,
        assistance with booking flights and appointments, and, crucially, money.
        It is hard, in a country with legal abortion and a national health
        service, free at point of delivery, to comprehend how important this can
        be.<\/p>\n
        <p>
          I have always thought that maybe someday I will get to raise a quiet
          glass to Irish independence, should they choose to stop relying on
          Britain to supply basic medical services to Irish women. In the
          meantime I\u2019ll toast the ASN. If you believe in reproductive
          choice and that a woman shouldn\u2019t be<br \ />\nforced to pick
          between carrying an unwanted pregnancy and a backstreet abortion,
          please consider supporting them.<\/p>\n
