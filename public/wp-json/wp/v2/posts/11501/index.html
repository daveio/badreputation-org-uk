    taking supermarkets to task, because in 2012 we really shouldn&#8217;t be
    seeing political mags (or<strong>

          &#8211; lately feminists around the UK have been making the point,
          with a particular upsurge recently (perhaps in the wake of other
          successful retail-themed mini campaigns, like Londonfeminist&#8217;s

                      Interest&#8217; magazines? I think you\u2019ll find all
                      genders are interested in politics and business.\u00a0You
                      are perpetuating the myth that women only care about
                      (because they are valued for) their\u00a0beauty.<\/p>\n
                      <p>
                        While I accept (but hate) that a large proportion of

                              may be\u00a0interested in reading

                                                    will be shown by genre and
                                                    they will not have a gender
                                                    prefix. There will not be an

                                                    stores as this will be a

                                                    the existing signage. This
                                                    should also address the
                                                    grammar issues that you
