<p>
  My father took me to secondhand bookshops throughout my childhood. They were
  mostly the same few haunts, growing increasingly familiar over the years,
  although as time dragged on, we would have to cross locations off our list as
  they closed. For him, these were business trips: an academic must have his
  books, and there was always some rare tome calling him to the chase. For me,
  they were about tracking down <a

      snatch only a portion: most people have heard of
      <strong

                              It has been often commented that
                              Streatfeild&#8217;s gift is her ability to
                              establish a rapport with her reader: she never
                              talks down to children, and deals with difficult
                              topics in the same way she describes
                              everyday\u00a0occurrences. Her commitment to
                              realism in writing extends to\u00a0her habit of
                              painstakingly explaining what all the characters
                              are thinking at all times. Thus, in
                              <strong
                                >Dancing Shoes<\/strong>, the just-orphaned
                                Rachel is considered unloving and aggressive
                                because she took her mother&#8217;s death with
                                equanimity: we the readers, on the other hand,
                                are kept aware of Rachel&#8217;s trials &#8211;
                                how she scowls to keep from crying and wants to
                                avoid any questions that might set her off. The
                                child-reader is nevertheless forced to see the
                                situation from at least two perspectives
                                simultaneously, a common approach to Literature
                                since Samuel Richardson, but amazingly
                                innovative in writing for children. The result
                                is a style that demands a responsibility from
                                its readers as well as understanding: it accepts
                                that life is often unfair, but invites children
                                to consider how best to respond.<\/p>\n

                                              These last two later move on to

                                              why two female doctors should have
                                              to live together, now I wonder if

                                              are some rumours about the nature

                                              women herself, and she has been
                                              claimed variously for a lesbian
                                              and an asexual). Certainly the

                                              Ruth Gervis suggests she saw it
                                              that way, even if Streatfeild may
                                              not have done: they are depicted
                                              in a stereotypical style that has
                                              barely changed since the novel was
