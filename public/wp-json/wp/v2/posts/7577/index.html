    >A while ago we asked you all what you enjoy doing with your time, and
    whether you had any thoughts on your hobbies from a gender perspective. A
    fair few of you got in touch &#8211; let&#8217;s kick off with <a
    href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/wuthering_alice\">Stephanie<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n
    <p>
      I firmly believe that craft is a feminist issue. On a personal level,
      it\u2019s amazing that every time I pick up my needles and what
      essentially amounts to a bit of string, I am connecting with women across
      thousands of years, as well as those in my life now; my aunt taught me to
      knit, my grandma taught me to crochet and another friend encouraged me to
      learn to embroider. I can take something made two hundred years ago and
      give it a modern spin. As someone who likes being artistic, but was never
      very good at traditional \u2018art\u2019, craft allows me to express
      myself.<\/p>\n

      \/><\/a>Yet I know that I am different from my grandma, her mother and so
      on. I do not make things out of financial necessity or to ensure that my
      family is clothed &#8211; it is often significantly cheaper to go out and
      buy a pair of socks or a jumper than what it costs to buy yarn or fabric,
      not to mention how long it takes to make something. And that\u2019s where
      feminism comes in: I make things because I can. Because knitting or sewing
      something gives me satisfaction. Because of the struggle of women before
      me and changes that they brought to society, I am not eternally pregnant
      or chained to a kitchen sink- I have free time, something that women
      didn\u2019t have much of. I have disposable income\u2026 if I want a
      \u00a320 ball of yarn or some amazing threads, I can have them and I can
      make something utterly frivolous with them if I so choose, too. At the
      moment, I am stitching tea towels with birds and bugs from Victorian
      natural history drawings to sell at a local craft fair. One of the joys of
      having a skill is seeing how you can use it to interpret it. Want to <a

      I see no coincidence in the fact that me learning to knit and becoming a
      feminist are linked. My first knitting book was <a
      href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/Stitch-Bitch-Handbook-Instructions-Generation\/dp\/0761128182\"><strong
        >Stitch and Bitch <\/strong><\/a> by Debbie Stoller, which lead me to
        read <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bust.com\/\"><strong
          >Bust<\/strong><\/a> magazine. Although I had always been brought up
          to
          <em
            >think<\/em> like a feminist, I was now, in my early twenties,
            becoming an
            <em
              >active<\/em> feminist. I wanted to learn more about my place in
              the world and how I could make that better. And I know that
              it\u2019s the same for a lot of women. Crafting is a gateway to
              this. (That\u2019s not to say I think all crafting is feminist. I
              think a lot of it is packaging traditional ideas of women in twee,
              Cath Kidston-esque clothing, trying to make money off the back of
              all things \u2018vintage\u2019. Solution to this: just read the
              blogs you like and do your own thing. As always, be discerning in
              your crafting!) Because of my love of all things textile, I
              learned to be a better person and became braver in defending what
              I believe in. Yes, I do get \u2018old lady\u2019 jibes, but those
              tend to come from the misogynist idiot I happen to share a
              staffroom with. And I usually come back with that there\u2019s
              nothing wrong in being an old lady, if it makes me happy. After
              all, I don\u2019t tell him how to live his life.<\/p>\n

                          knitting) was listed as one of the activities that was
                          not considered \u2018tough\u2019. I consider myself
                          relatively streetwise &#8211; I grew up in inner city
                          Leeds, went to a very difficult school and had by no
                          means a privileged time growing up. But because I
                          knit, I am not, apparently, tough. I think that women
                          are re-embracing crafting because we live in a world
                          where so much is out of our control- the world is not
                          going to become a better place overnight and women are
                          still marginalised in some areas of everyday life. So
                          it is natural to want to take control somewhere,
                          whether that is mastering the perfect satin stitch or
                          being really good at motorcycle maintenance. Your
                          mileage (and activity of choice) may vary.<\/p>\n

                                                          I firmly believe that
                                                          craft is a feminist
                                                          issue. Every time I
                                                          pick up my needles, I
                                                          am connecting with
                                                          women across thousands
                                                          of years, as well as
                                                          those in my life now.
                                                          Yet I know that I am
                                                          different from my
                                                          grandma, her mother
                                                          and so on. I do not
                                                          make things out of
                                                          financial necessity,
                                                          and that&#8217;s where
                                                          feminism comes in.
