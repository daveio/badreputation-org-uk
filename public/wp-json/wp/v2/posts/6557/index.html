  Special K is one of those things I&#8217;ll happily eat for breakfast, or if I
  feel like eating cereal. The berry edition is kinda okay. The Special K
  <em
    >diet<\/em>, on the other hand, is about as special and remarkable as white
    in a snowstorm, especially when you realise that you&#8217;ll get a more
    interesting bunch of flavours from taking your hungover colleague up on the
    offer when they dare you to shove your own face into the shredder tray at
    work and explore whether it can double as a food trough. The entire diet is
    marketed towards going down a jeans size as fast as is humanly possible for
    \u00a33.89. (I have already mastered going down four jeans sizes without
    paying any money. I just walk out of H&#038;M and into M&#038;S.)<\/p>\n
    <p>
      But! Aside from the fact the diet is as useful and realistic to genuine
      lasting weightloss &#8211; or healthy living &#8211; as wearing a loaded
      fruit bowl on your head, and
      <em
        >aside<\/em> from the fact that these ads are flagged squarely at
        certain kinds of gendered insecurity that make me go &#8220;Shine? Shine
        on fire, Kellogg. Right on
        <em
          >fire<\/em>&#8220;, a quick look at some history of Special K&#8217;s
          posters is an interesting little trip to go on.<\/p>\n
          <p>
            Because it didn&#8217;t used to hang quite this way, ironically.
            Kellogg launched Special K in 1955, when my mum was toddling and the
            NHS was just hitting a ripe old age of seven. It was,
            Kellogg&#8217;s big proud blue-and-white &#8220;history site&#8221;
            informs me, <a
            href=\"http:\/\/www.kellogghistory.com\/history.html\">&#8220;the
            first high-protein breakfast cereal ever offered to
            consumers.&#8221;<\/a> Two years before, they&#8217;d launched
            &#8220;melba-toasted PEP flakes&#8221;, which &#8230; yeah. The
            Fifties. I don&#8217;t even.<sup

                a Special K poster from that era, in which the elderly, man and
                woman alike, are DISCOMBOBULATED BY THE SHEER IMPACT OF
                KELLOGG&#8217;S NUTRITIONAL PROMISE.<\/a> However, neither of

                    There is something distinctly strange about the vintage
                    poster looking kinder to women as consumers than the
                    now-poster, is what I&#8217;m saying. Especially given our
                    common habit of dissing our idea of the Fifties as some sort
                    of comparative hell for that hackneyed GCSE-textbook
                    concept, &#8220;the role of women&#8221;. Holding forth in
                    the pub, you might crack one about how ads like Special K

                      >look <\/em>like they fell &#8220;out of the 1950s&#8221;,
                      until you remember that in the 1950s they were just
                      ditching rationing and things like bananas <a
                      href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/ww2peopleswar\/stories\/25\/a4148525.shtml\">were
                      riveting news<\/a>. So maybe nobody wanted to goddamn well
                      eat any more cardboard than they really bloody had to.
                      This is not to say that things were better then (I also
                      found an ad showing a bikini-clad woman trying to touch
                      her toes with the slogan
                      <em
                        >IT&#8217;S TIME FOR JELLO<\/em>) but they&#8217;re not
                        really much better at all now, are they, which gives me
                        quite a bit of uncomfy pause for thought. Yes, following
                        on from (in the UK) the Ministry of Food and <a

                        Carrot<\/a> and all, there was a real focus on
                        nutrition, convenience foods, and how (or whether) these
                        could be combined &#8211; and I mean, yeah, Kellogg were
                        good at playing with that, with slogans like
