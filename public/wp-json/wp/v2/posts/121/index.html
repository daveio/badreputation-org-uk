    Well in hand<\/h3>\n
    <p>
      Alas and alack, I have no Latin language linked <a
      href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/09\/Photo-9.jpg\">tea-towel<\/a>
      (or indeed any other lexical kitchenware). So I had to do some
      trans-linguistic dictionary groping (oh ho) to reveal that the verb
      &#8217;emancipate&#8217; can be broken down into not one but
      <em
        >three <\/em>etymological building blocks (oh, alright pedant, two words
        and one suffix).<\/p>\n
        <p>
          Ahem. These are: &#8216;e-&#8216; (out of), &#8216;manus&#8217;
          (hand), &#8216;capere&#8217; (to capture, to seize). So
          <em
            >to emancipate <\/em>is, etymologically speaking, something like
            &#8216;to release something captured from your hand&#8217;. Its
            first meaning in the OED is &#8216;to release or set free (a child
            or a wife) from the
            <em
              >patria potestas<\/em>, the power of the
              <em
                >pater familias<\/em>&#8216;. Most of those Latin words come
                back to the same idea: Big Daddy and his eternal potency, and it
                is here that, presumably, the &#8216;Emancipation of
                Women&#8217; has its phrasal origins. To
                <em
                  >emancipate <\/em>someone is to relinquish the (legal) power
                  that you hold over them, and it is thus that, in its
                  association with women&#8217;s rights, the word has come to
                  be\u00a0associated with first wave feminism and its fight for
                  property rights, women&#8217;s suffrage and basic legal
                  equality. It is presumably for this reason that it is no
                  longer widely considered technically applicable to gender
                  issues, as a quick look at Wikipedia will confirm.<\/p>\n

                                          itself to be illegal. The
