    <p>
      In the 1956 version of
      <strong
        >The King and I<\/strong>, there&#8217;s a bit where Anna Leonowens
        (Deborah Kerr) is surrounded by an army of small children trying to lift
        her skirt up. Understandably disturbed (her background is, after all, in
        the mores of Victoriana), she seeks an explanation from the eponymous
        King&#8217;s &#8216;head wife&#8217;, who replies placidly that they
        think she is dressed like that because she&#8217;s &#8220;<span
        style=\"font-style: italic;\">shaped <\/span>like that&#8221;.<\/p>\n
        <p>
          &#8220;Well, I certainly am NOT,&#8221; she replies, lifting up her
          crinoline to reveal a neat little pair of ankle-length
          bloomers.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_108\" style=\"width: 325px\"

        <p>
          <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">The King and I <\/span>was one of
          my mother&#8217;s army of VHS tapes recorded off 1990s TV to keep her
          offspring pacified of a Saturday night, and I always watched Deborah
          Kerr sailing around the orientalist palace with a confusion similar to
          that expressed by the child army.\u00a0Why did these women
          wear\u00a0clothes that made them look like a different species from
          their male counterparts? It&#8217;s apparently illogical, one of
          fashion&#8217;s <a
          href=\"http:\/\/www.thefashionpolice.net\/images\/2008\/07\/08\/harem_pants.jpg\">many
          confusing mistakes<\/a>, yet the big skirt trend was one that
          dominated female fashion for at least three centuries, and continued
          to have iconic moments long after the Victorians. In fact, it&#8217;s
          a true constant, from Madame de Pompadour and Elizabeth the First to
          Dior&#8217;s New Look, Marilyn Monroe&#8217;s subway moment,
          <em
            >Grease <\/em>(where Sandy rejecting it in favour of spray-on wet
            look leggings always feels troubling), and, relatively more
            recently, the designs of Vivienne Westwood.<\/p>\n
            <p>
              There is an obvious explanation for its attractiveness which can
              be seen simply by looking at the silhouette: in algebraic terms,
              massive hips = lots of lovely womb space to let. In the case of
              the twentieth century&#8217;s most famous blonde, the explanation
              reaches new realms of subtlety (big skirt + wind + camera =
              \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3). But this precludes their frequent favour with
              the women themselves: Madame de Pompadour and Marie Antoinette
              were, as Westwood is, fashion leaders, not followers, and it
              cannot be denied that there is a certain something about a skirt
              with a big twirl factor that feels inoffensively joyful. And
              looking back to Elizabeth &#8216;Heart and Stomach of a Man&#8217;
              The First, it seems unlikely that the Ditchley Portrait is trying
              to convey nothing more than Hey Boys, Check Out My Womb.<\/p>\n

                  So what <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">is <\/span>a
                  &#8216;crinoline&#8217;?\u00a0It&#8217;s actually something
                  very specific; in its original sense specific enough to be a
                  brand name, referring to &#8216;a stiff fabric made\u00a0of
                  horse-hair and cotton or linen thread&#8217;. The brand name
                  in question uses
                  <em
                    >crinoline<\/em>&#8216;s literal meaning,
                    &#8216;hair-thread&#8217; to allude to its composition from
                    horse hair, but later on,
                    <em
                      >crinoline<\/em> comes to refer to other materials, such
                      as &#8216;whalebone or iron hoops&#8217;, which serve to
                      expand petticoats. The dictionary gives as a second
                      definition the crucial word &#8216;hoop-petticoat&#8217;,
                      which it glosses as something &#8216;worn under the skirt
                      of a woman&#8217;s dress in order to support or distend
                      it&#8217;.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_109\" style=\"width:

                        This &#8216;hoop-petticoat&#8217; was the eighteenth
                        century term for the big skirt, and here it took the
                        form of an architectural arrangement of side-panniers so
                        wide that doorways frequently had to be expanded to
                        accommodate their wearers. But it was not something new:
                        on the contrary, the hoop bore no small resemblance to
                        earlier innovations, most notably the sixteenth-century
                        (Ditchley Portrait) &#8216;farthingale&#8217;,
                        supposedly so named in reference to the wooden structure
                        that gave it its shape \u2013 which was, ironically
                        enough, a sort of wooden cage.\u00a0Conversely,
                        the\u00a0<em
                          >crinoline<\/em>, a nineteenth century invention,
                          reached new heights of freedom, since for the first
                          time the skirt could move independently of its owner,
                          a phenomenon that may have led to the Victorian
                          preoccupation with ankles, but which certainly created
                          a new erotic focus for men walking through the park on
                          a windy day. Previous to this, women hankering after
                          widened hips had to wear many layers of heavy
                          under-petticoats in addition to the cage-structure,
                          which not only hindered their movement but also
                          hampered the skirt&#8217;s possible circumference, so
                          once the light and airy crinoline-cage appeared, a
                          side-effect was the virtually limitless expansion of
                          the skirt&#8217;s width \u2013 reaching its nexus in
                          Anna Leonowens&#8217; ridiculous garments, whose
                          recreation in 1956 combined the excesses of the New
                          Look silhouette with the historical extravagance of
                          the Victorian empire.<\/p>\n
                          <p>
                            Indeed, it is perhaps here that the crinoline shows
                            its teeth: the well-known <a

                            wide-hipped Anna Leonowens sitting among her Gentle
                            Savage pupils and breezing about the palace with an
                            ease denied to the stiffly clad king&#8217;s wives,
                            making the big skirt somehow emblematic of the
                            West&#8217;s superior treatment of women, and the
                            &#8216;enlightened ideas&#8217; of the British
                            Empire, while its unstoppable expansion may itself
                            have something to do with the ever-increasing size
                            of colonial ambition.<\/p>\n

                                Perhaps, then, with all these sartorial
                                possibilities, it was to be expected that the

                                encompass transferred meanings: a piece of

                                  all the way to the initial definition of the
                                  word as a &#8216;stiff lining&#8217;. The
                                  suggestion here could be that the structures
                                  underneath a woman&#8217;s clothes must either
                                  lend strength to something fundamentally
                                  flimsy (that old &#8216;body of a weak and
                                  feeble woman&#8217; chesnut), or, conversely,
                                  that this is a type of armour, the armour worn
                                  by, as Elizabeth I would probably have put it,
                                  a &#8216;king, and a king of England
                                  too&#8217;. In the queen&#8217;s case,
                                  I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s something going
                                  on with metaphorical hip-circumferance
                                  fertility: the virgin mother of the nation,
                                  but one whose regal power gives her a strength
                                  akin to a sacrificed Christ, a mother who will
                                  fight tooth and nail to protect her
                                  child-country. Less maternal, more
                                  martial?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:
