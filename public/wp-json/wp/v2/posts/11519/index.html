<p>
  July has been very empty on my playing schedule. \u00a0Moving house &#8211;
  all those\u00a0<em
    >boxes<\/em> &#8211; kinda took it out of me. \u00a0I&#8217;ve just been
    pottering on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.teamfortress.com\"><strong
      >TF2<\/strong><\/a> and aside from that I finally finished <a
      href=\"http:\/\/www.ea.com\/dead-space-2\"><strong
        >Dead Space 2<\/strong><\/a> in one 3-hour stint. \u00a0I&#8217;m also
        on holiday from the end of July so, that&#8217;s put a deadline on
        things. \u00a0I thought to myself,<em
          >\u00a0&#8220;What can I bring to Gamer Diary this month if I
          haven&#8217;t played anything?&#8221;<\/em> and then, while gormlessly
          starting at
          <strong
            >Steam<\/strong>, I had an idea: a competition! \u00a0So, at the end
            of this post there&#8217;ll be some details on how you could win one
            of the titles I&#8217;ve written about this year (via Steam).<\/p>\n
            <p>First I&#8217;ll give you something of substance.<\/p>\n</p>

              The posts I wrote last month (<a title=\"[Gamer Diary] From Indie

              were somewhat laden with negativity &#8211; you could say
              legitimately &#8211; so I thought that for this offering I&#8217;d
              continue to talk about our gaming community and the relationship
              developers have with their audiences. \u00a0Most importantly,
              I&#8217;d like to highlight a couple of examples of those who are
              getting it right. \u00a0Or, at the very least &#8211; because no
              one can be perfect &#8211; who seem to be doing it better than
              others.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              There are a lot of devs and publishers who have their plus points,
              and there are those that have their negatives. \u00a0Most have
              both, but some are more\u00a0<em
                >memorable<\/em> for either one of these polar options.
                \u00a0For this post I&#8217;d like to look at the ones who are
                most famed for being a little bit awesome.<\/p>\n

                              target=\"_blank\">short I made<\/a>. \u00a0The
                              tutorials started off simply enough but after a
                              few of them, &#8216;Bay&#8217; (our guide) seems
                              to dispense with the explaining-it-to-a-layperson
                              format and just starts blurting jargon at you
                              left, right and centre. \u00a0Hence why I
                              haven&#8217;t finished the tutorial video yet.
                              (That and the fact I got distracted with my little
                              Western-style showdown there.)<\/p>\n
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              One other criticism at this point is that the
                              Store Page (on Steam) for the Filmmaker has a list
                              of minimum system requirements, but not all of
                              these are accurate. \u00a0The page lists that you
                              need a minimum resolution of 1366 x 768, which I
                              had, but this creates problems with displaying all
                              the necessary functions of the tool. \u00a0I had
                              to bump up to the &#8220;suggested&#8221; 1920 x
                              1080 in order to get full functionality out of it.
                              \u00a0But, hey, it&#8217;s free, it&#8217;s pretty
                              fun and is a great way to get involved in the
                              community.<\/p>\n
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Now, <a title=\"Steam Greenlight\"
                              href=\"http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/greenlight\/\"
                              target=\"_blank\">Greenlight<\/a> is not something
                              I expect to benefit from &#8211; as I&#8217;m not
                              a developer &#8211; but I will definitely be
                              checking it out from a voter&#8217;s perspective.
                              \u00a0Here&#8217;s the basic premise: lots of
                              games get submitted to Valve looking to be sold
                              via Steam; they started to think maybe there was a
                              better way of selecting games; having seen the
                              success of the Workshop ratings system they
                              thought of employing a similar thing for games;
                              Greenlight allows developers to submit their games
                              and be at the mercy of the community. \u00a0In
                              theory, if the community likes your game(s), you
                              get high ratings\/votes, and your game gets to go
                              to Steam and be sold through the client.<\/p>\n<p
