  The Duchess at the centre of John Webster&#8217;s play
  <strong
    >The Duchess of Malfi<\/strong>\u00a0(1612-13) acquires a lot of her
    edginess in the original play from the fact that her husband has died before
    the action begins. She is a young \u2013 and according to her brother
    Ferdinand, &#8220;lusty&#8221; \u2013 widow, whose combination of financial
    independence and sexual experience makes many in her vicinity
    nervous.<\/p>\n
    <p>
      The equivalent man would be called &#8220;eligible&#8221;, and receive a
      lot of invitations from women with marriageable daughters. But a woman in
      the same situation becomes the subject of a campaign of surveillance and
      torture which ends in her death.<\/p>\n

      \/><\/a>The more I worked on Webster\u2019s play, the more I noticed that
      the Duchess was part of a much larger cultural anxiety around the figure
      of the widow in English literature. She\u2019s an extreme case,
      admittedly: few other fictional widows end up eating apricots grown in
      horse dung, kissing the severed hand of their husband or being strangled
      on the orders of their lycanthropic and potentially incestuous twin
      brother.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      But a continual low charge hums around widows, from the comic grotesque of
      Widow Twankey to the alluringly threatening Black Widows of gangster
      novels. Via the Wife of Bath, the Dowager Duchess of Grantham and Aouda
      from
      <strong
        >Eighty Days Around The World<\/strong>, to take a handful nearly at
        random.<\/p>\n
        <p>
          Of course it alters across the eras, but time and time again, the
          figure of the widow acts as a focus for drama.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes the charge seems to derive from the fact that she is no
          longer dependent upon any man, or socially &#8220;explained&#8221; via
          her relationship to a father or husband. Sometimes it comes instead
          from the way a widow is seen as
          <em
            >over<\/em>-defining herself in relation to a man no longer
            present.<\/p>\n
            <p>
              Either way, widows in literature often hold the potential to
              disrupt social order in a variety of ways.<\/p>\n

                This article, however, is not about widows. It is about women
                who are

                  <p>

                          marriage that never happened, whilst Olivia\u2019s is
                          to remind her of her dead brother, whose memory stops
                          her from wanting to receive suitors. Nonetheless, they

                          the role, adopting some of the characteristics
                          associated with grieving spouses.<\/p>\n

                          withdraw from normal social life, and refuse to put
                          themselves under the jurisdiction of men. Neither are
                          exactly successful in their attempt to construct
                          themselves positively within the role of a

                          &#8220;frustrated&#8221; and &#8220;twisted&#8221;
                          womanhood, unsuccessful within the novel\u2019s plot
                          and the butt of jokes in subsequent culture. She
                          becomes a \u201ctragic\u201d figure in both the
                          classical and slang senses of the word: an image of
                          wronged heroism in her own mind, and a sad bitter
                          spinster to the world outside.<\/p>\n

                          Her veil, usually a temporary garment to mark her
                          passing between two states, becomes a fixture,
                          blending with the cobwebs which now cover her wedding
                          cake. In Miss Havisham, Dickens created a figure who
                          memorably combines the revulsion and anxiety felt by
                          Victorian (and later) society towards women who refuse
                          to play out the social roles ascribed to them.<\/p>\n

                            with a veil, at least at the beginning of the play.
                            The first thing we hear about her is that for seven
                            years the world \u201cShall not behold her face at
                            ample view\/ But, like a cloistress, she will veiled
                            walk&#8230;all this to season\/ A brother\u2019s
                            dead love, which she would keep fresh\/ And lasting
                            in her memory\u201d.<\/p>\n
                            <p>
                              When Viola (dressed as the male Cesario) manages
                              to speak to her, Olivia prepares by putting her
                              veil back on, setting up the comedy by-play in
                              which Viola claims not to know who the lady of the
                              house is, and the moment when Olivia pulls it back
                              and demands \u201cLook you, sir, such a one I was

                              done?\u201d<\/p>\n

                            <p>
                              Within the first act the grieving Olivia\u2019s
                              attempt to seclude herself is defeated by a
                              combination of plot and Viola\u2019s rhetorical
                              skills. The play treats her mourning as one of the
                              restrictive, self-imposed roles which so many of
                              the characters are trapped in as the action
                              begins. Orsino is locked into his schtick as
                              self-obsessed Petrarchan lover, Sir Toby as the
                              party knight who slinks home in the early hours of
                              every morning, Malvolio as the image of Puritan
                              rectitude and Olivia as the grieving veiled figure
                              wandering inconsolably around her rooms as if her
                              husband had just died.<\/p>\n
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              These roles are all disrupted for the
                              audience\u2019s amusement and the characters\u2019
                              correction during the ensuing scenes, with the
                              play particularly conspiring to trick Olivia out
                              of her image of herself as a grand widow.
                              There\u2019s an echo here of Miss Havisham, though
                              in a very different key: women are not permitted
                              to adopt the role of widow simply because they
                              want to.<\/p>\n
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Both characters are diverted away from a
                              successful performance as \u201cpseudowidows\u201d
                              by the narratives in which they appear: Olivia to
                              happy marriage and Miss Havisham to pathological
                              bitterness and mockery.<\/p>\n

                              <p>
                                In fact we don\u2019t have to rely on my
                                close-reading of these fictional texts to find
                                anxiety around women \u201cplaying\u201d at
                                being widows. That harping on Olivia wearing a
                                veil and walking secluded from men \u201clike a
                                cloistress\u201d brings another group of women
                                into play, whose apparent freedom from male
                                jurisdiction has produced anger and revulsion in
                                various eras.<\/p>\n
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                I don\u2019t have space to examine the way in
                                which nuns in the Middle Ages navigated the
                                rhetoric of \u201cbrides of Christ\u201d
                                alongside the reality that many entered the
                                community after the death of a husband, or their
                                social position. But one particular case stands
                                out amongst the criticism of female religious
                                orders: the bishop of Olm\u00fct\u2019s attack
                                on the Beguines.<\/p>\n
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                These women, who lived together in small
                                self-governing groups, taking few vows and
                                following the Rule of no specific order, were
                                the subject of a lot of criticism in the later
                                thirteenth century. Bruno, the bishop in
                                question, wrote to the pope in 1273 to demand
                                they be suppressed.<\/p>\n
                              </p>
                              <p>In R.W. Southern\u2019s words:<\/p>\n</p>
                              <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                  he complained that&#8230;the women used their
                                  liberty as a veil of wickedness in order to
                                  escape the yoke of obedience to their priests
                                  and \u2018the coercion of marital bonds\u2019.
                                  Above all, he was indignant that young women
                                  should assume the status of widowhood against
                                  the authority of the Apostle who approved no
                                  widows under the age of
                                  sixty.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  The bishop was referring to verses in the New
                                  Testament book of 1 Timothy, in which
                                  instructions are given for the way the
                                  \u201corder of widows\u201d should be run and
                                  who should be admitted. These women, who
                                  worked for the church and were provided with
                                  support, should all be over the age of sixty,
                                  have a good reputation and previously carried
                                  out pious works.<\/p>\n
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  Obviously \u201cwidow\u201d has a technical
                                  significance in this Biblical passage, but I
                                  was fascinated by Bruno\u2019s line of attack:
                                  that the young women of the Beguines were
                                  setting themselves up
                                  <em
                                    >as if<\/em> they were widows, and thus
                                    escaping male authority.<\/p>\n
                                    <p>
                                      His metaphor of a &#8220;veil of
                                      wickedness&#8221; once again acts as a
                                      focus for male anxiety over women who
                                      won\u2019t accept their assigned
                                      role.<\/p>\n
                                    </p>

                                      In part two of this post, I&#8217;ll delve
                                      into widow imagery in modern TV and film,
