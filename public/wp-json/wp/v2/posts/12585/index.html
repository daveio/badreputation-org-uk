  I wrote a quick and exasperated post <a
  href=\"http:\/\/rhianejones.com\/2012\/10\/23\/on-things-that-surely-shouldnt-need-saying\/\">recently<\/a>
  on what I perceived to be a reductive, stereotyping and patronising use of the
  term \u2018working-class\u2019 cropping up in a lot of otherwise well-meaning
  writing. I was initially inspired by the editors of Vagenda Magazine&#8217;s
  <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.newstatesman.com\/lifestyle\/2012\/10\/defence-caitlin-moran-and-populist-feminism\">defence
  of Caitlin Moran<\/a>, but the surrounding debate and its systemic problems
  are bigger than both of these. Despite retaining their article as a
  jumping-off point, therefore, I\u2019m less interested in the specifics of
  Vagenda themselves than in giving a more considered explanation of some of the
  reasons behind my annoyance with the idea that intersectional feminism and
  &#8216;comprehensible&#8217;, &#8216;accessible&#8217; feminism are somehow
  incompatible.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  One reason behind how badly the Vagenda article was received was, I think, the
  authors\u2019 attempt to address a relatively specific issue (&#8216;Leave
  Caitlin alone, she&#8217;s working-class and hardly anyone else in the UK
  media is!&#8217; \u2013 as if that isn&#8217;t in itself a whacking great
  elephant in the room, on which more later), and to address it in the more or
  less specific context of the kind of feminism they&#8217;d seen and
  experienced in the UK, without recognising that, well, feminism is really
  fucking big. <\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  As explained in <a
  href=\"http:\/\/blackfeminists.org\/2012\/10\/23\/dear-vagenda-editors\/\">this
  post<\/a>, \u2018feminism\u2019, even just within the UK, is not and never has
  been exclusively \u2018a white, middle class movement\u2019. The history,
  theory and practice of feminism is diverse, multiracial, international, and
  takes in issues of class, age and sexuality among others. Throughout
  feminism\u2019s development there have been, as noted <a
  href=\"http:\/\/shadowscrescent.wordpress.com\/2012\/09\/10\/an-open-letter-to-caitlin-moran\/\">here,<\/a>
  tension, discussion and conflict within the movement over how this diversity
  is represented, and, as noted <a
  href=\"http:\/\/dearwhitefeminists.wordpress.com\/\">here<\/a> in 2008, there
  continue to be.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  The concept of <a
  href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Intersectionality\">intersectionality<\/a>
  is, in part, a way of helping to articulate this diversity. This was the very
  term Vagenda identified, oddly, as an example of unhelpfully academic
  language, when in fact, as the vast majority of responses to their article
  have pointed out, it\u2019s one that\u2019s relatively simple to explain by
  reference to lived experience. It\u2019s also a term whose practical relevance
  is easily proved; in the immediate fall-out from Caitlin Moran\u2019s failure
  to question Lena Dunham on the racial diversity of
  <strong
    >Girls<\/strong>, her fellow journalist <a
    href=\"http:\/\/bimadewunmi.tumblr.com\/\">Bim Adewunmi<\/a> did a
    comprehensive and accessible job of clarifying why this mattered, both
    explaining intersectionality and making a positive case for it:<\/p>\n
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        I am a woman, a black woman born in London to Nigerian parents, a Muslim
        woman (who does not wear a hijab or veil). I am educated and
        self-employed but relatively low-earning. These things, as standalones
        or collectively, define how I see the world. One often bleeds into the
        other so comprehensively, they seem almost interchangeable. This is, in
        its most basic form, what we call intersectionality: the idea that we
        wear a lot of caps, and often in challenging one wrong, we are
        challenging many. In reading that Moran tweet, my first thought was:
        &#8220;I cannot afford to take off my &#8216;race cap&#8217; and focus
        just on the plain ol&#8217; sexism that plagues the television industry;
        and nor do I want to.\u201d &#8211; <a
        href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/commentisfree\/2012\/oct\/08\/girls-twitter-feminism-caitlin-moran\">Source<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        Intersectionality allows the integration of systems of oppression \u2013
        patriarchy, capitalism, racism, among others \u2013 to be identified,
        analysed, and challenged, and it provides a means of transcending and
        critiquing single-issue politics. The theory may be obscure, the
        practice surely is not.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        There is an identifiable, and to some extent understandable, urge within
        some pop-feminist platforms to crusade against a feminism which they
        describe as too theoretical, remote and academic to gain mass appeal.
        The idea of a divide between academic and populist ways of promoting
        progressive politics is not unique to feminism; a similar debate
        periodically engulfs much of the left. How can \u2018ordinary
        women\u2019, or indeed \u2018ordinary people\u2019, be appealed to in
        language which will resonate with their everyday concerns and not
        alienate them by using words of more than two syllables?<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        But the first half of that question doesn&#8217;t automatically imply
        the second. Being \u2018ordinary\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean being stupid.
        It doesn\u2019t mean not having been to university either. Politics
        predicated on the assertion of an academic\/middle-class versus
        populist\/working-class divide are, at best, disingenuous, presenting as
        mutually exclusive what is surely more a question of priorities. <\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a difference between wishing to focus on \u2018ordinary\u2019,
        material concerns \u2013 the gradual erosion of living and working
        standards under the present government; closures and funding cuts to
        women\u2019s refuges and childcare services; the removal of housing,
        child, and disability benefits \u2013 and assuming that the people
        affected by these concerns cannot recognise, analyse and talk about them
        for themselves, in language which can be sophisticated as well as
        rudimentary. <\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        Too often, in debates within feminism \u2013 often valid and necessary
        debates \u2013 over how best to engage \u2018ordinary women\u2019, these
        women are implicitly othered, there to be appealed to and won over by
        more enlightened middle-class feminists rather than considered capable
        of engaging in the debate on their own terms and by themselves.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        In such narratives, liberal commentators often employ presumptious ideas
        of what \u2018a working-class girl\u2019 might think of feminism,
        without having any meaningful direct experience of this on which to
        draw. Back in March, by contrast, the
        <em
          >Camden New Journal<\/em> writer <a
          href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/PavanAmara\">Pavan Amara<\/a> produced
          <a
          href=\"http:\/\/www.thefword.org.uk\/features\/2012\/03\/feminism_still_\">an
          excellent piece<\/a> for The F-Word in which she interviewed a variety
          of working-class women and recorded their opinions and attitudes
          towards feminism. Her conclusion \u2013 that working-class women face
          preoccupying problems of poverty and inequality, and frequently regard
          mainstream feminism as remote and irrelevant \u2013 is the same kind
          of thing that Vagenda\u2019s post was trying to get at, but far more
          plausibly expressed and empirically grounded. My problem lies not with
          that argument itself, but with the patronising ideas about class which
          seem to inform so many presentations of the argument. <\/p>\n
          <p>
            It\u2019s particularly galling to see an assertion with which I
            agree \u2013 that class is an aspect of identity too often left out
            of debate \u2013 being used in ways which can actually shore up
            negative assumptions about class. From Vagenda&#8217;s
            article:<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Going into certain state comps and discussing the nuances of
              intersectionality isn\u2019t going to have much dice if some of
              the teenage girls in the audience are pregnant, or hungry, or at
              risk of abuse (what are they going to do? Protect or feed
              themselves with theory? Women cannot dine on Greer alone.)
              &#8220;This woman does not represent me&#8221;, they will think of
              their well-meaning lecturer, because how can she, with her private
              education and her alienating terminology and her privilege, how
              can she know how poverty gnaws away at your insides and suppresses
              your voice? How would she know how that
              feels?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              (I assume there\u2019s been an unintended elision between
              secondary and university education made there, since in my state
              comprehensive we had teachers, not lecturers, and I\u2019d be
              frankly astounded if any of them had been privately educated
              \u2013 they\u2019d been
              <em
                >educated<\/em>, yes, but by the state, exactly as I was being.
                \u2018State-educated\u2019 shouldn&#8217;t be used as a synonym
                for \u2018stupid\u2019 either.) <\/p>\n
                <p>
                  Generalisations like this are often in danger of buying into
                  narratives which see working-class parents, schools and
                  communities as unable to impart education or instil political
                  consciousness in the same way as their middle-class
                  counterparts, and which present working-class girls as the
                  helpless inhabitants of some kind of neo-Victorian
                  netherworld, a perspective which is, again, less helpful than
                  it clearly wishes to be.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  What this perspective also neglects is that Women\u2019s
                  Studies, at least in the UK, was rooted to a large extent in
                  attempts by women of generally less privileged backgrounds to
                  question and critique the privileges of existing academia and
                  to draw attention to neglected perspectives and experiences,
                  including those marginalised by virtue of class, race, age and
                  sexuality. That feminism in academia is now
                  <em
                    >considered<\/em> middle-class and irrelevant perhaps says
                    more about the squeezing out of attention to and discussion
                    of class-based analysis within it; the erosion of empowering
                    traditions of adult education and of self-education through
                    libraries and community colleges; and the pricing out at
                    postgraduate and increasingly at undergraduate level of
                    poorer students, than anything about education\u2019s
                    intrinsic appeal to and suitability for anyone outside the
                    bourgeoisie.<\/p>\n
                    <p>
                      The unhelpful aspects of these well-intentioned arguments
                      are compounded by the fact that those who find themselves
                      in the position to make them to a mass audience are hardly
                      ever working-class themselves. The restriction of access
                      to politics, media, arts and entertainment to those with
                      the parental support or independent wealth to get them
                      through unpaid internships, or maintain them in precarious
                      freelance work, is referenced increasingly often as it
                      becomes more glaringly apparent, but hardly ever with a
                      view to how the situation might be changed. Caitlin Moran
                      is frequently held up as a representative of The Real
                      World on the grounds that she had it tough once upon a
                      time, as though her current individual high profile makes
                      up for the fact that there is hardly any mainstream media
                      or political platform for those who continue to have it
                      tough right now. To their credit, it\u2019s not as if
                      Vagenda don\u2019t recognise this:<\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p>
                        What feminism needs is more voices \u2013 a whole chorus
                        of them. By all means, we can criticise those already at
                        the top, but we should be combining that with a real
                        desire to listen to women from all walks of life and
                        their experiences: to actively seek them out, rather
                        than waiting for the lucky few to claw their way into
                        our ranks. Giving them jobs on newspapers so that they
                        can write movingly and persuasively about the
                        inequalities they suffer.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        But what should also be recognised is that an
                        intersectional perspective is vital in facilitating
                        these developments, and that intersectionality affects
                        the very focus on \u2018ordinary\u2019 concerns which
                        these arguments advocate. The political climate since
                        the banking crisis of 2008, and the imposition of
                        economic austerity, has only sharpened the need to
                        prioritise issues of material inequality and financial
                        stability &#8211; <a

                        for women<\/a>. Much of the burden of analysing and
                        opposing the impact on women of rising unemployment and
                        the erosion of the welfare state is being shouldered by
                        women whose identities mean they are under attack from
                        several intersecting angles: as low earners, as mothers,
                        as women of colour \u2013 very often, all three. Here
                        for instance is <a

                        The promotion of a multiplicity of voices within
                        feminism is surely better done in ways which challenge
                        alienating ideas of what &#8216;feminism&#8217; is,
                        rather than in ways which risk entrenching these ideas
                        by presenting feminism as an intrinsically
                        white-normative and middle-class-normative movement
                        which should benevolently open its gates to

                          call a feminist impulse, even if the women in question
                          wouldn\u2019t necessarily call themselves feminists.

                          <p>
                            Equally, while there\u2019s nothing wrong in seeking
                            to engage \u2018ordinary\u2019 women in feminism
                            through using \u2018accessible, populist\u2019
                            language, it\u2019s also not too much to ask for
                            this language to be conscious and sensitive, free of
                            condescension and stereotyping, and seeking to be
                            inclusive through attention to race, ability, age
                            and sexuality as well as class. The problems of the
                            &#8216;ordinary&#8217; working class are inherently
                            intersectional: material inequality is intersected
                            by racism, sexism, homophobia, and ageism, all
                            experienced as real and immediate issues rather than
                            matters of abstract theory. It\u2019s just that this
                            generally takes place outside a media and political
                            mainstream which is increasingly the preserve of a
                            homogenous and insular elite. Liberal condescension
                            which pays lip service to issues of race and class
                            is less meaningful than attempts to address the many
                            failings in cultural and political representation
                            which make it increasingly difficult for
                            non-privileged voices to be engaged with on their
                            own terms.<\/p>\n<ol class=\"footnotes\"><li
