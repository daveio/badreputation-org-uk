                such\u00a0cringeworthy song might be more appropriate for a
                series so blatantly gendered. Well, so did I, but\u00a0one happy
                little girl at a time, the Friends range has swayed my
                feelings.<\/p>\n
                <p>Let me backtrack and give it some history.<\/p>\n</p>
                <p>
                  The Lego Friends series was released earlier this year.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  When the toys (and adverts) were unleashed, the internet
                  seemingly exploded with outrage. (I am,<br \ />\nof course,
                  referring to
                  <em
                    >my<\/em> internet &#8211; the one with feminist twitter
                    feeds, blogs about toys and sexy pictures of Neil Gaiman.
                    Your internet might be a bit different.)<\/p>\n
                    <p>
                      In particular I watched <a
                      href=\"http:\/\/www.feministfrequency.com\/\"
                      target=\"_blank\">Feminist Frequency<\/a>\u2019s <a
                      href=\"http:\/\/www.feministfrequency.com\/2012\/01\/lego-gender-part-1-lego-friends\/\"

                      target=\"_blank\">the series<\/a>, but I also read
                      blogposts from dads who want their girls to work in
                      Silicon Valley and study at MIT.<\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The first few toys released were a bakery, a caf\u00e9, a
                      beauty shop, a house and an inventor\u2019s<br
                        \
                      />\nworkshop. These initial toys are made up of pastel
                      pink and purple bricks, they only feature girls and<br
                        \
                      />\nthose roles present are mainly gendered home-keeping
                      roles.<\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      My blood was boiling, like many other people&#8217;s, at
                      the narrow roles I could see girls being pushed into. At
                      my local Toys R Us there is a vast collection of Lego from
                      the <a
                      href=\"http:\/\/creator.lego.com\/en-gb\/Default.aspx\"
                      target=\"_blank\">Creator series<\/a> to <a
                      href=\"http:\/\/www.lego.com\/cars\/en-us\/default.aspx\"
                      target=\"_blank\">Cars<\/a>. In fact I have never seen so
                      much in one retailer.<\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      However, the Friends series is not placed in their giant
                      Lego selection. It is in a (very clearly labelled)
                      \u2018Girlz\u2019 aisle,nowhere near the Lego corner,
                      which has so much sparkle and glitter I thought cupcakes
                      were<br \ />\ngoing to spontaneously erupt from the
                      walls.<\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Friends is not like the rest of Lego: it\u2019s for girls,
                      and must be segregated.<\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>So far, so sexist.<\/p>\n</p>
                    <p>
                      However, I\u2019m slowly putting the guns down. Across the
                      various worlds of Lego, equality is growing. As someone
                      who has an obsessive love of toys, I frequently visit
                      their website. Every time I find<br \ />\nmyself riled up
                      about Lego, I go on the site and find that a far greater
                      balance of characters is presented there than we see in
                      the shops.<\/p>\n

                      does include phrases like &#8220;she\u2019s no damsel in

                      Here, the minority female mini figures I have collected
                      become role models. Still a token, but a valuable one at
                      that, and the question remains why we don\u2019t see more
                      of this outside of the website.<\/p>\n

                    <p>
                      I recently decided to explore the <a

                      target=\"_blank\">Friends section of the website<\/a> and
                      was pleasantly surprised\u00a0and then genuinely excited
                      about what it offers. I believe that Lego listened to t<a
                      href=\"http:\/\/www.change.org\/petitions\/tell-lego-to-stop-selling-out-girls-liberatelego\"
                      target=\"_blank\">he petition from Change.org<\/a> (the
                      one that got over 50,000 signatures, the one I signed)
                      back in April 2012, and have turned something that was
                      completely sexist into a city of steps toward
                      empowerment.<\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      First of all, they have toned down the overwhelming pink
                      tones of the bricks, and gone for more brown tones, like

                      This last set was definitely the swing vote for me. It has
                      the least amount of pink; mere touches of it on the plane.
                      Furthermore, the stereotyped role for women in a plane is
                      Air Hostess, and Lego didn\u2019t go there. Stephanie is
                      the pilot of her own seaplane, looking more Amelia Earhart
                      than Pan Am.<\/p>\n

                      The Friends themselves might enjoy traditionally feminine
                      roles, but they also have jobs, varied interests and
                      detailed characters that allow for diverse roleplaying.
                      The key with Lego is that it can be as many things as you
                      can imagine. <a

                      instance, has one piece which suggests this is for fashion
                      &#8211; but with the large desk, the ruler and the laptop
                      Emma could just as easily be an architect or an

                      We also shouldn&#8217;t fall into the trap of thinking
                      that enjoying balloons or sweets makes you weak.
                      It&#8217;s more that giving girls
                      <em
                        >only<\/em> that which is sugary-sweet which is the
                        issue. Although Lego still have a long way to go, I
                        think there are at least positive conversations being
                        had at Lego HQ.<\/p>\n

                          Sarkeseesian says that the emphasis with the Lego
                          Friends series is on traditional home-keeping play.
                          She cites the adverts, comparing the Friends advert
                          slogan \u201cDrive to the newly built caf\u00e9\u201d
                          to the \u201cYou can build the castle\u201d of another
                          Lego advert featuring some classic father-son
                          bonding.<\/p>\n
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          She draws the reasonable conclusion that boys are
                          offered a more active play experience that encourages
                          them to use maths and motor skills.<\/p>\n

                          However, if we look on the Lego website the section
                          for Friends has the theme song I quoted at the
                          beginning of this post, which accompanies all their

                            I think this new emphasis on

                              the whole time you shop is part of a change that
                              encourages girls to gain all the skills and
                              experiences that Lego has to offer.<\/p>\n

                                They may not have it all, but the newer Lego
                                Friends sets and marketing are a step in the
                                right direction, and with these steps being
