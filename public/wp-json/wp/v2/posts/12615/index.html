<p>
  \u201cChivalry\u201d is one of those words guaranteed to start an argument. In
  a newspaper column, a bar or an office, a discussion about chivalry tends to
  divide the participants into two energetically opposed groups: those who
  believe that &#8216;women should act like women and men should act like
  men&#8217;, and those who believe that the cavalry tactics of the thirteen
  century have little to offer modern conceptions of gender.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  Of course, I\u2019ve deliberately stacked the deck there, partly because I
  don\u2019t think the chivalry debate is actually a debate; it\u2019s a way of
  obscuring the real issues behind a warm, old-timey phrase.<\/p>\n

  \/><\/a>\u201cChivalry\u201d tends to enter the conversation when it is
  suggested that women might be treated as equals in the public space, that they
  might not be subjected to sexualised commentary for simply walking down the
  street, or might be paid an equal salary to men. <\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  Then \u201cchivalry\u201d suddenly arrives as the benign, patronising face of
  patriarchy. Don\u2019t women want men to open doors for them, to buy drinks
  for them, to arrange for them to be unable to support themselves economically
  and thus be dependent on the contingent goodwill of another person for their
  livelihood? That\u2019s just plain mean, and almost certainly emotionally
  manipulative.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  The reason this gambit interests me is not how ridiculous it sounds when
  spelled out (though that too) but how much explanatory force is attributed to
  such a vague and nebulous ideology.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  Even more than evopsych, another gender-wrangle bugbear, \u201cchivalry\u201d
  offers so little specific justification. Even the debased version of
  evolutionary psychology one meets in the arguments of MRAs and redditors who
  have stumbled furiously into the comments section of
  <em
    >Feministe<\/em> (in the manner of a partygoer in Cancun who reaches for
    that Hawaiian shirt in the wardrobe and finds himself amid the snows of
    Narnia) purports to present an argument and a set of historical (well,
    mythical) explanations.<\/p>\n
    <p>
      That\u2019s why \u201cchivalry\u201d is so often a distraction, a way of
      blowing warm, nostalgic smoke across the debate until its not clear what
      we\u2019re even arguing against.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      The other reason it seems odd is the diametrically opposed way we use
      \u201cmedieval\u201d. Like sixteenth-century humanists, we rush to brand
      anything barbarous, vicious or ignorant as \u201cmedieval\u201d. The
      actions of Boko Haram, for example, or the conditions in an inner-city
      crackhouse, or Creationism. Somehow \u201cchivalry\u201d expresses a
      comfortable reactionary vision of gender relations, in which women simper
      and accept being corralled into particular spheres of activity away from
      real power, whereas \u201cmedieval\u201d is backward and dumb. The bad
      kind of backward and dumb.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Between them these terms manage a bait and switch on our engagement with
      the past and its bearing on gender politics. A necessary one, given the
      preponderance of \u201cprincess\u201d vocabulary which saturates the
      images offered to girls and young women. Narratives about dating, dress
      and men\u2019s attention are full of language which assumes that the
      chivalric romances of the Middle Ages \u2013 all those castles, quests,
      damsels and princes \u2013 are the natural image of relations between
      genders.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time, it\u2019s necessary to decry the treatment of women in
      other countries as \u201cmedieval\u201d, to maintain the fiction that
      women in our culture have nothing to trouble their heads about. The
      terminology carefully allots two meanings to the same collection of past
      events, and assigns our (rightly) divided feelings of shame, horror,
      belonging and heritage to whichever side is needed to keep gender norms in
      place.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      The word \u201cchivalry\u201d has been particularly bothering me recently
      since I started rereading bits of Malory\u2019s
      <strong
        >Morte Darthur<\/strong>. One of the most influential Arthurian works in
        the English language, this fifteenth-century version of the Camelot
        legends looms over almost all subsequent Arthurian works in some form or
        another, whether that be Tennyson\u2019s
        <strong
          >Idylls of the King<\/strong>, T.H. White\u2019s
          <strong
            >The Once and Future King<\/strong>, or the recent BBC TV
            <strong
              >Merlin<\/strong>.<\/p>\n
              <p>
                An examination of this romance also gives a bit of a lie to the
                myth of \u201cchivalry\u201d. It\u2019s not that it debunks the
                soft-focus pageantry with a brutal expose of fifteenth-century
                repression and sexual violence (though an account of its author
                might do something of the sort). Rather, it undermines the
                \u201cprincess\u201d paradigm by offering a very different kind
                of female character.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                As Helen Cooper notes in <a
                href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/Morte-Darthur-Winchester-Manuscript-Classics\/dp\/0199537348\/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1355402968&#038;sr=1-1\"

                <strong
                  >Morte Darthur<\/strong>, women are often the characters who

                  <blockquote>

                    <p>
                      The book also seems quite at home with women\u2019s
                      romantic agency: to quote Cooper again, Malory
                      &#8220;takes it as natural and unthreatening&#8230;that
                      women have sexual desires&#8221; and act upon them.<\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      One particular passage struck me as illuminating this
                      issue: when Dame Lyonet realizes her sister Lyonesse is in
                      love with the knight Sir Gareth. The section doesn\u2019t
                      need much more prologue:<\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p>
                        Then was Sir Gareth more gladder than he was more. And
                        then they troth-plight, other to love and never to fail
                        while their life lasteth.<\/p>\n
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        And so they burnt both in hot love that they were
                        accorded to abate their lusts secretly. And there Dame
                        Lyonesses counselled Sir Gareth to sleep in no other
                        place but in the hall, and there she promised him to
                        come to his bed a little before midnight.<\/p>\n
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Their counsel was not so privily kept but it was
                        understood, for they were but young both, and tender of
                        age, and had not used such craft before.<\/p>\n
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Wherefore the damosel Lyonet was a little displeased,
                        and she thought her sister Dame Lyonesse was a little
                        over-hasty, that she might not abide the time of her
                        marriage; and for saving of her worship [reputation] she
                        thought to abate their hot lusts. <\/p>\n
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        And she let ordain by her subtle crafts that they had no
                        their intents either with other as in their delights,
                        until they were married.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n

                      <p>
                        Unfortunately I haven\u2019t got space to continue
                        copying out the episode, but the way she decides to use
                        her \u201csubtle crafts\u201d to frustrate her
                        sister\u2019s insufficiently crafty crafts involves
                        creating an enchanted knight who comes charging in
                        whenever Gareth and Lyonesse manage some alone-time,
                        causing Gareth to have to battle it.<\/p>\n

                        wanting to have sex before marriage: that use of

                            world \u2013 though Lyonesse\u2019s is far less
                            effective. The initiative Cooper identifies in
                            Malory\u2019s women is dramatically present here:
                            Lyonesse instructs her lover where to be at night
                            and comes to visit him, whilst her sister makes a
                            counter-plan to foil her.<\/p>\n
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Sexual attraction is hardly an unusual motive for
                            action in the fiction we see around us, but in this
                            case it\u2019s the young women who take action and
                            negotiate their way between their feelings and the
                            expectations of a broader community.<\/p>\n
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            There\u2019s also something meta-romance about
                            Lyonet\u2019s solution. I may be over-reading this
                            brief passage, but Malory\u2019s deliberately
                            laconic style encourages us to interject motivations
                            and connections to make sense of the narrative. So I
                            think the form Lyonet\u2019s obstruction takes
                            \u2013 an enchanted bouncer \u2013 is also a symbol
                            of her superior ability to understand heroic romance
                            as a genre.<\/p>\n
                          </p>

                            \u201cAlright, little sister\u201d, her choice of
                            magical weapon seems to say, \u201cYou want to be
                            the heroine of a chivalric romance? Because in all
                            the romances I\u2019ve read you don\u2019t get the
                            knight that easily&#8230;\u201d She ironically goes
                            along with Lyonet\u2019s casting of herself as
                            romantic damosel, and cranks up the volume,
                            providing her sister with her very own enchanted
                            nemesis to overcome before she can get what she
                            wants.<\/p>\n
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            If we wanted to translate this into a realist mode,
                            this gestures towards the idea that love
                            doesn\u2019t end your story arc as a person, and
                            that finding the person you want to spend
                            \u201chappily ever after with\u201d doesn\u2019t
                            subsume your identity into a \u201cgame over\u201d
                            montage. <\/p>\n
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Lyonesse still has to deal with what Camelot will
                            think of her, and she\u2019ll do so whilst remaining
                            Lyonesse and a member of her own society. The
                            meta-romantic element, in which Lyonet goes to the
                            spell-book to slow up her sister\u2019s love life,
                            seems to valorise young women who are symbolically
                            and semantically competent, as well as active in the
                            world.<\/p>\n
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Lyonet wins this episode because she is more capable
                            than Lyonesse of taking the narratives which
                            surround them in their culture, understanding and
                            decoding them, and then redeploying those narratives
                            to her own advantage, with a combination of critical
                            analysis, sisterly compassion, and geeky in-joke
                            wit.<\/p>\n
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            So if nothing else, this chunk of Malory provides us
                            with another reason to sneer at \u201cchivalry\u201d
                            when used to argue that the world was better when
                            women were (supposedly) passive, and to own up to
                            our medieval heritage, whether it&#8217;s
                            embarrassing, troubling or apparently
                            irrelevant.<\/p>\n
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Because occasionally we may trip over moments like
                            this, where Dame Lyonet is exercising her subtle
                            crafts. Crafts which, as I read them over again,
                            look more and more like medieval geek
                            feminism.<\/p>\n
