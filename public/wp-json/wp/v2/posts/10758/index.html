  The last time I wrote that <a
  href=\"http:\/\/velvetcoalmine.wordpress.com\/2011\/05\/26\/on-liking-american-psycho\/\">yes,
  I did like
  <strong
    >American Psycho<\/strong><\/a>, and no, that wasn&#8217;t because I&#8217;d
    only seen the film, I was pleasantly surprised to hear that other women felt
    similarly, but I\u2019m aware that we\u2019re still a minority.
    <strong
      >American Psycho<\/strong> proved controversial even before its release in
      1991, its unedited manuscript pushed from publisher to publisher, leaked
      extracts from it incurring public outrage, and its eventual appearance
      leapt upon by critics with the single-minded speed of a rat up a Habitrail
      tube. In terms of people judging the book without having read it, not a
      great deal seems to have changed. I don&#8217;t really expect to alter
      anyone&#8217;s opinion with this post, and it isn&#8217;t really even a
      recommendation &#8211; it&#8217;s just an exploration of why I don&#8217;t

          I read the book as a deeply moral \u2013 disappointingly puritan, if
          you like \u2013 anti-capitalist and even vaguely feminist tract.
          <strong
            >American Psycho<\/strong> is a house built with the tools of the
            master: it is, just like 1980s capitalism, crass, lurid, vulgar,
            heavy-handed and unapologetic. It bludgeons home its basic homily,
            that consumerism fails to make us happy or to lend meaning to our
            lives, with all the subtle and delicate artistry of a Reagan speech.
            But beyond this, in 2012 it\u2019s undeniable that the values and
            trends the book castigated two decades back have only become more
            deeply entrenched. Does the book\u2019s earnest, and still
            depressingly relevant, indictment of capitalism and consumerism
            excuse its scenes of rape, torture and murder? Maybe not, but I
            think those who criticise the book on these grounds, like those who
            called for its suppression and boycott twenty years ago, end up
            alienating a potential if problematic ally.<\/p>\n

                It&#8217;s hard to take seriously much that Ellis says, about
                either this book in particular or his work in general. A lot of
                his public pronouncements deal in Dylanesque obfuscation, or
                deliberate outrage-baiting \u2013 his Twitter account alone is a
                masterclass in trolling \u2013 which makes it both absurd and
                unfortunate that his work is so often perceived as deadly
                serious and condemned on the same grounds. His explanations of
                the origins of

                  >American Psycho<\/strong>, though, have the ring of
                  sincerity, and place the book in opposition to the impact of
                  1980s society and culture on the individual male:<\/p>\n

                      with having to become an adult and what it meant to be an
                      adult male in American society. I didn&#8217;t want to be
                      one, because all it was about was status. Consumerist
                      success was really the embodiment of what it meant to be a

                      my life. I was living like Patrick Bateman. I was slipping
                      into a consumerist kind of void that was supposed to give
                      me confidence and make me feel good about myself but just

                    <p>
                      Bateman is of course capitalism\u2019s dirty little secret
                      &#8211; the madman in the attic. His sociopathy is
                      mirrored in the socio-economic inequality and political
                      insincerity around him. In his world, the atomised and
                      alienated dealings of colleagues, friends and lovers are
                      highlighted through contrast with the visceral intimacy of
                      murder, and Ellis\u2019 stylistic trick of detailing
                      frenzied sex and violence in flat and clinically
                      dispassionate prose does not disguise that as a form of
                      human encounter it carries more weight than Bateman\u2019s
                      ritualised interactions with colleagues or his sexless and
                      loveless interactions with girlfriends. His narration
                      frequently betrays a yearning for consummation, contact
                      and engagement in the midst of the desperate aching
                      loneliness, the longing for meaning (even Bateman\u2019s
                      violence is purposeless and arbitrary) which permeates the
                      book. In a society so unsustainably alienating and unequal
                      that the centre plainly cannot hold, we see how badly
                      things can fall apart.<\/p>\n

                        torture and dismemberment of women\u2019, Ellis <a

                        the book and author on these grounds display a puzzling
                        inability to distinguish between creator and creation,
                        which as a first principle is utterly bizarre \u2013
                        where is it written that characters must necessarily be
                        extensions of an approving creator?<\/p>\n

                      <p>
                        The novel contains a few dozen pages in amongst four
                        hundred or so on the torture and dismemberment of women
                        \u2013 and of men \u2013 though their impact is
                        disproportionate. These scenes \u2013 often ludicrous,
                        often grotesque to the point of comedy \u2013 are
                        presented as a logical extension of the lack of empathy
                        and mindless, numb urge to consume that characterise the
                        world in which they take place. They don\u2019t seem
                        written in order to arouse any more than the
                        determinedly un-erotic, sterile sex scenes do, or the
                        interminable deconstructions of clothes, cosmetics and
                        Huey Lewis\u2019 back catalogue. The book gradually
                        reaches a point where reading about all three feels
                        indistinguishable in its horrific, unrelenting
                        tedium.<\/p>\n

                                          Bateman could make his dates expire of
