                  >si<\/em> (=&#8217;be it!&#8217;), the third person imperative
                  of

                        often used in Shakespeare as an answer to negative
                        questions. We could do with one of them nowadays, no?
                        How many times have you answered a question with

                              The penultimate word in our Alphabet,\u00a0<em
                                >yes <\/em>is frequently one of the first words
                                we learn on earth; its meaning is clear and
                                unequivocal, by turns disastrous, passionate,
                                exhilarating, loaded and humdrum &#8211; but
                                always positive in the full sense of that word.
                                It is almost invariably repeated, as in Joyce
                                (and Usher) &#8211; &#8216;yes I will,
                                Yes&#8217;, the successive affirmations
