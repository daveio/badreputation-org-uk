                    Slits\u2019 early music and performance was a squall of
                    untrained, instinctive energy, and their casually
                    confrontational appearance and behavior drew negative
                    reactions ranging from media disapproval to violent
                    hostility. Although tending to recoil from any overtly
                    political espousal of feminism, the band bluntly advocated
                    female independence and empowerment, encouraging girls to
                    form bands and to define themselves by their actions rather
                    than their relationships.<\/p>\n
