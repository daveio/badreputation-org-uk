<p>
  That&#8217;s our Revolting Women fest all done and dusted for the moment at
  least. Obviously there are loads of things we didn&#8217;t manage to cover,
  but we hope you enjoyed it. <\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  In the meantime, here&#8217;re some relevant links, some of which throw the
  baton to you. If you&#8217;re feeling like revolting, now&#8217;s the
  time&#8230; <\/p>\n

      >Block The Bridge, Block The Bill, 9th October:<\/strong><\/a> &#8220;On
      Sunday October 9th, join UK Uncut on Westminster Bridge and help block the
      bill. On one side of Westminster Bridge is Parliament. On 7th September,
      MPs in the Commons voted for the end of the NHS as we know it. On the
      opposite side of the bridge is St Thomas\u2019 Hospital, one of
      Britain\u2019s oldest medical institutions. If the bill passes, hospitals
      like St Thomas\u2019 will be sold to private corporations, the staff put
      on private payrolls and beds given over to private patients. Despite the
      government\u2019s lies, this bill represents the wholesale privatization
      of the NHS and, with it, the destruction of the dream of comprehensive
      healthcare provided equally to all. We will not let a coalition of
      millionaire politicians and private health lobbyists destroy our NHS. Be
      on Westminster Bridge for 1pm on October 9th and together let\u2019s block
      this bill from getting to our hospitals.&#8221;\n
      <p>
        I work at one of the hospitals UKUncut are talking about. It looks no
        better from the inside. We&#8217;re having our birthday party < 48 hours
        before (you're totally invited! see below!), but I will be hauling
        myself out of bed for this. Readers, join Team BadRep as we revolt
        against both Torygeddon and our inevitable shared hangover in one giant
        last stand.<\/li>\n

                        straightness of the YA sf and fantasy sections may have
                        little to do with what authors are writing, or even with
                        what editors accept. Perhaps solid manuscripts with
                        LGBTQ protagonists rarely get into mainstream
                        editors\u2019 hands at all, because they are been
                        rejected by agents before the editors see them. How many
                        published novels with a straight white heroine and a
                        lesbian or black or disabled best friend once had those
                        roles reversed, before an agent demanded a change? This
                        does not make for better novels. Nor does it make for a
                        better world.&#8221;<\/li>\n
