    \/><\/a>The Gilmore girls (of TV&#8217;s
    <strong
      >The Gilmore Girls<\/strong>) don\u2019t have an awful lot in common with
      the thirteenth century Beguines. Paris Geller, on the other hand \u2013
      Rory Gilmore\u2019s nemesis, love rival, roommate, co-plotter and sometime
      editor \u2013 also attracts ridicule as a young woman who presumes on the
      privileges of widowhood.<\/p>\n
      <p>
        Her affair with her professor, the novelist Asher Fleming, is treated by
        most people as a slightly tacky fling between a vain older man and a
        naive young student. Whilst Paris drops broad hints to Rory about her
        grand passion (\u201cMmm, I smell of pipe smoke&#8230;\u201d) it is made
        pretty clear to the audience that Fleming regularly has casual affairs
        with young women who take his course.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        When he dies suddenly (&#8220;When he&#8230;were you&#8230;?&#8221;
        &#8220;No, Rory. This great man was not laid low by my vagina.&#8221;)
        Paris goes into mourning, and is appalled that not enough notice is
        being taken on campus. She takes it upon herself to hold a wake for
        Fleming, complete with a stack of his last book and herself in dignified
        black, holding court on the sofa.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        Though Paris is not treated as cruelly as Miss Havisham, her party is
        marked out as the culmination of her grandiose ideas about her
        relationship. Behaving as Asher\u2019s widow is another one of
        Paris\u2019 obsessive eccentricities, and the scene is undercut by the
        appearance of a beer keg in the background by two frat boys whom Rory
        hurriedly shoos away.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        Paris may believe she is enabling the community to pay their proper
        respects to a great man of letters, whose loss she inevitably feels most
        keenly, but most of the people at the party think it\u2019s a kegger
        thrown by some girl they\u2019ve never heard of.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        It\u2019s a funny sequence, and Paris is given an unexpected emotional
        weight by Liza Weil, but the narrative makes it clear she is not
        entitled to widowhood, and no-one grants it to her. Apart from Emily
        Gilmore, admittedly, which does nothing to bolster Paris\u2019
        cause.<\/p>\n

        Funeral Blues<\/h2>\n
        <p>
          This tension between people who feel like widows, and the society
          which refuses to legitimise their view of themselves, is given another
          twist in the final example I\u2019d like to discuss: the speaker in
          W.H. Auden\u2019s poem
          <strong
            >Funeral Blues<\/strong>.<\/p>\n
            <p>
              Performed so memorably by John Hannah in
              <strong
                >Four Weddings and A Funeral<\/strong>, the poem has become one
                of the most famous and popular elegies in English. In its best
                known version, the poem runs thus:<\/p>\n
                <p>
                  <em
                    >Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone,<br

                      \
                    />\nSilence the pianos and with muffled drum<br \ />\nBring
                    out the coffin, let the mourners come.<\/em><\/p>\n

                        >Let aeroplanes circle moaning overhead<\/em><br

                                                    third verses in the
                                                    treatment of the death and
                                                    its consequences. From
                                                    demanding exaggerated
                                                    outward ceremonies to mark
                                                    the beloved\u2019s death,
                                                    the poem starts to imagine
                                                    in both more personal and
                                                    more cosmological
                                                    terms.<\/p>\n

                                                    If the first two verses
                                                    concentrate on the public
                                                    and social sphere (the area
                                                    in which widowhood is
                                                    bestowed and validated, as
                                                    we have seen), the latter
                                                    two are concerned with the
                                                    relationship of one
                                                    individual to the whole
                                                    universe, and how that has
                                                    been dislocated by another
                                                    person\u2019s death.<\/p>\n

                                                    In both there is an
                                                    anguished hyperbole, an
                                                    awareness of the discrepancy
                                                    between the speaker\u2019s
                                                    own feelings and the way the
                                                    rest of the world sees the
                                                    matter. The irony of the
                                                    lines about the pigeons and
                                                    the sun are directed
                                                    inwards, sketching the
                                                    speaker\u2019s recognition
                                                    of their lack of proportion
                                                    alongside a refusal to
                                                    countenance the idea that
                                                    proportion is possible any
                                                    more.<\/p>\n
