      >Editorial Note:<\/strong> Deep Silver have, since this post was written,
      apparently issued <a

      Hooray! Nonetheless, we&#8217;re not seeing a reason not to post this
      anyway, because it&#8217;s not as if this kind of shit isn&#8217;t part of
      a wider stream of crap that makes us feel pretty endlessly tired when
      we&#8217;re trying to get on with consuming our pop culture. And a
      retraction doesn&#8217;t really answer the question of why this crap was
      and is so often considered OK in the first place, and is only reconsidered
      when some sort of hullabaloo is made. And also, Mia wrote this very
      promptly, and I, the ed, was under a pile of Stuff and couldn&#8217;t get
      to posting it on the day. \u00a0But what she has to say about how she felt
      remains pretty on-point about the issues in general. So: let it

      <p>Dear Deep Silver,<\/p>\n</p>
      <p>
        I have just seen the parody ad for the collector&#8217;s edition of <a

          >Dead Island: Riptide<\/strong><\/a>. While violence against women and
          graphic dismemberment are fairly cheap, extremely tasteless and far
          too easy targets for \u201cshock value\u201d, I&#8217;m impressed by
          your provocative attempts to further the dialogue about the sinister

          <p>You claim that this hunk of resin will:<\/p>\n</p>

              Well, as someone who has notched up damn near 1,000 hours of
              zombie killing in recent years (thanks, Steam, for keeping track
              of that. I was starting to worry that I was wasting my life),

              <em
                >have<\/em> a conversation about it. I&#8217;ll go and brew up a

                stool and think about what you&#8217;ve done.<\/p>\n
                <p>
                  I can hear it already, the rumbling of defensive PR managers
                  approaching.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  \u201cBut it&#8217;s a zombie game! The whole point of it is
                  to commit heinous acts of violence against the undead in self
                  defence! A zombie torso with its limbs severed is a trophy
                  that represents your prowess!\u201d<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  Before I address this, in the interests of full disclosure, I
                  have to say that I am not a qualified physician. However, from
                  my forays into the study of human and zombie biology, I can
                  confirm that the healthy, warm-tanned skintone, obvious
                  freshness of the blood, the lack of any sort of necrosis or
                  decomposition of the flesh indicates that this torso was
                  certainly not a zombie at the time of her
                  dismemberment.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  Exposure of the lower ribs suggest traumatic chest injury;
                  however, it&#8217;s not clear whether this occurred before or
                  after the time of death. My working hypothesis is that her
                  death had something to do with either decapitation or the loss
                  of all her blood. Even without formal medical training, I am
                  fairly confident in positing that there is no coming back from
                  complete removal of the head.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  There isn&#8217;t even any artistic merit in what you&#8217;ve
                  created, which is almost as offensive as the glorification of
                  horrific violence against women. You have the gumption to
                  describe it as:<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    &#8230;Dead Island\u2019s grotesque take on an iconic Roman
                    marble torso sculpture.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n

                  <p>
                    No. Stop. Please. The skies are filled with the anguished
                    cries of Classics and Art History students, joined by the
                    despairing sobs of everybody with a functioning pair of
                    eyes. There are several salient differences between your
                    abomination and classical works of art, but I&#8217;ll set
                    out a few of these for your convenience:<\/p>\n
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    \n
                    <li>
                      Artistic merit. Marble sculptures are exquisite works by
                      highly-skilled craftspeople demonstrating the depth of
                      their abilities. Weeks of work go into a marble sculpture,
                      creating something dynamic and evocative from a chunk of
                      something cold and unyielding drawn from the earth. These
                      are not pieces that can be \u201cdesigned\u201d in an
                      afternoon by a gaggle of fratboy marketers over their
                      weekly office keg.<\/li>\n
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Anatomy. Sculptors who work with marble show an intimate
                      and thorough knowledge and understanding of human anatomy.
                      Every muscle, every curve, every millimetre of skin is
                      honed to a perfect representation of the human form. What
                      you have done is plonked two tennis balls on a solid block
                      of resin, doodled in a crude cleavage with a Sharpie, then
                      splashed raspberry sauce all over it and called it a day.
                      Which brings me neatly onto my next point&#8230;<\/li>\n
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Overt sexualisation and glamourisation of violence against
                      women. Classical torso sculptures are not without limbs
                      due to some horrible run-in with a horde of undead and a
                      crazed survivor with a katana. If any Classics types would
                      like to weigh in on this, I&#8217;d be interested to
                      learn. However, I&#8217;m pretty sure that the motivations
                      of those classical sculptors was not \u201cHurr, violence
                      is EPIC. You know what else is epic? TITS! Yeah! But you
                      know what&#8217;s
                      <em
                        >not<\/em> epic? Any part of a woman that isn&#8217;t
                        tits or crotch. Let&#8217;s put, yeah, some tits and a
                        crotch in a string bikini, and like, cut everything else
                        off. Gamers will eat that up. Oh man, I&#8217;m jizzing
                        my pants already. Tits and extreme violence. We&#8217;re
                        geniuses.\u201d (Again, classics students, if
                        there&#8217;s any evidence of the great Graeco-Roman
                        sculptors having had this discussion, I will withdraw
                        this point. Let me know.)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n
                        <p>
                          In summary: what the hell? After the first
                          <strong
                            >Dead Island<\/strong> game failed to quite live up
                            to its own teaser trailer, do you just feel like you
                            need to continue along this trajectory of
                            disappointment? Were you hoping to hit rock bottom
                            with today&#8217;s sick display in the hope that
                            thereafter, the only way would be up? If
                            that&#8217;s the case, I&#8217;d be tempted to
                            applaud your shamelessness, had it not been such a
                            swing and a miss.<\/p>\n
                            <p>
                              Now, I&#8217;m a feminist, but I also don&#8217;t
                              believe that every catastrophic misunderstanding
                              of how to exploit the \u201cdesirability\u201d of
                              anything that vaguely resembles a woman&#8217;s
                              body (usually one that conforms to narrow
                              standards of Western beauty) is born of true
                              misogyny.<\/p>\n
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              I believe it&#8217;s quite possible that you
                              \u201cjust didn&#8217;t think\u201d of the
                              implications and repercussions of showing a
                              violently dismembered female torso and selling it
                              as an ornament. For those of us &#8211; women and
                              some men &#8211; who actually live in bodies like
                              the one messily represented in your
                              collector&#8217;s edition, it isn&#8217;t possible
                              to \u201cjust not think\u201d about the
                              possibilities and the realities of
                              violence.<\/p>\n
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Women are disproportionately more likely to be the
                              victims of domestic violence or sexual abuse, both
                              by people they know and by strangers. We are
                              taught from childhood that our bodies are weaker,
                              that if we don&#8217;t want to be attacked we have
                              to dress demurely, to know our limits, to keep our
                              mouths shut and to do as we&#8217;re told.<\/p>\n
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              We live in a victim-blaming world that constantly
                              promotes the idea that the only way to not be a
                              victim is to not provoke those strong and burly
                              menfolks, who cannot be held to account if they
                              attack you because you were obviously \u201casking
                              for it\u201d if and when it happens. Although this
                              line of reasoning was born of institutionalised
                              misogyny, it doesn&#8217;t exactly paint men in
                              the most flattering of lights either.<\/p>\n
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              The discussion is thankfully broadening, so this
                              is not an issue I&#8217;ll go deeper into here.
                              But Deep Silver, consider yourselves called out.
                              There&#8217;s a wealth of resources, information,
                              blogs, zines, articles, and opinion pieces out
                              there. You have no excuse for not educating
                              yourselves about why what you have done is
                              damaging and irresponsible.<\/p>\n

                              Everybody fucks up sometimes when it comes to the
                              way they think about or treat people less
                              privileged than they are. What really proves
                              whether or not they&#8217;re capable of meeting
                              the criteria for being a decent human being, or a
                              company with any integrity, is how they handle and
                              learn from their fuckups. My advice? Apologise. Be
                              humble. Be grateful to people who have called you
                              out on this. Make the choice to educate
                              yourselves. And for the love of all things zombie,
                              don&#8217;t do it again.<\/p>\n

                              I do, however, have one thing to be grateful to
                              you for about this. Should I find myself romancing
                              a fellow gamer in future, and we go back to their
                              house, this statuette will be an

                                  Perhaps your statue could replace the endless
                                  whining about \u201cthe friendzone\u201d as
                                  the hallmark of somebody utterly clueless

                                  disrespectful to women. Then I would laud you
                                  for your achievement, because that shit is
