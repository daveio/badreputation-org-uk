<p>
  The moment I find her <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.tiitutakalo.net\/index.php?page=english\">website<\/a>,
  linked by a reader who&#8217;s posted some of her <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.tiitutakalo.net\/images\/kuvituksia\/kuvituksia3.jpg\">illustrations<\/a>
  for a feminist textbook on Tumblr, I&#8217;m in love with her work.
  She&#8217;s not widely known here in the UK, and works mainly in Finnish (with
  some translation, mainly into Swedish). Her website bio identifies her as a
  feminist before everything else. And her illustrations are so arresting, so
  real, that I have to learn more. <\/p>\n

      So much stuff is available to English-speaking markets that I reckon the
      vast majority of us here in BadRep Country have a lot of inertia about
      discovering non-English language media, from the music of Rammstein
      through to subtitled films, even.<sup

          kickass that I just don&#8217;t care. I&#8217;m willing to muddle
          through. Muddling is how a great deal of important learning Gets Done.
          And if you&#8217;re interested in feminist art and media from places
          outside the UK\/US over a language barrier, then comic books are, for
          obvious reasons, an
          <em
            >excellent<\/em> place to have a go at climbing over said language
            barrier. <\/p>\n

              If you&#8217;re a regular reader you&#8217;ll know that at least
              three of Team BadRep, me included, are budding illustrators
              ourselves, so I was fascinated to hear how Tiitu approaches her
              work. <\/p>\n

                  \
                />\n&#8220;I think I have always been a feminist. Or all the
                conflicts with the rest of the world have made me one. It
                started when I was a child. My mother was a career woman in the
                metal industry. Most of her co-workers and colleagues were men.
                She drove the car and also fixed it herself and one of her
                hobbies was carpentry. And my father did cooking, and he did our
                carpets by hand &#8211; I don&#8217;t know the word for it, in
                Finnish it&#8217;s same as knitting, knitting carpets &#8211;
                and he still does that as a hobby. He also did some sewing. And
                my parents never told us (me and my sister) that we
                couldn&#8217;t do something because we were girls, or that we
                should behave a certain way based on our gender. I never heard
                anything like &#8220;nice girls do not act like that&#8221;.
                Before I went to school I didn&#8217;t know that our family was
                somehow different. I didn&#8217;t know that people think there
                are some jobs for women and others for men. I didn&#8217;t know
                that men and women are not equal in this world.<\/p>\n

                  in school I noticed that girls and boys are treated
                  differently. Expectations are different for boys and girls.
                  Even as a child I knew it was not OK. I also noticed that all
                  my friends didn&#8217;t share this opinion. They were already
                  brainwashed to think that girls are nice and quiet and tidy,
                  and boys are not, and that this was some kind of natural
                  law.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  &#8220;I started calling myself a feminist when I met other
                  girls and women who were using that word and were proud to be
                  feminists. Before that, I thought that feminism was a dirty
                  word. (That&#8217;s what they want you to think!) And yet,
                  still, I was thinking and acting like a
                  feminist.&#8221;<\/p>\n

                                            \/><\/a>&#8220;I just finished a
                                            graphic novel about the history of
                                            my hometown, Tampere. It&#8217;s a
                                            collaboration with a scriptwriter
                                            and the Museum of Tampere, so
                                            it&#8217;s different from what I
                                            have done before. Maybe more
                                            mainstream. But I like the idea.
                                            There are nine stories from
                                            different periods. For example the
                                            1850s story is about a 14-year-old
                                            girl working in a cotton factory
                                            &#8211; not the story of the factory
                                            owner like it usually is in the
                                            history books. The book is also
                                            published in English as
