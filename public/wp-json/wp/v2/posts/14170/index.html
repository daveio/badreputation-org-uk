          The nights have drawn in, there\u2019s a chill in the air and
          it\u2019s that time of year where I like to do what I, admittedly,
          like to do pretty much the rest of the year: gather the family around
          a nice cosy horror film and scare the bejeezus out of
          ourselves.<\/p>\n

          in Brighton, that there\u2019s a thriving scene of horror fanatics,
          including the founders of the <a
          href=\"http:\/\/www.classichorrorcampaign.com\/\"
          target=\"_blank\"><strong
            >Classic Horror Campaign<\/strong><\/a>, whose raison d&#8217;etre
            is to bring back British horror to our TV screens and who run a
            brilliant occasional horror film festival called Frighten
            Brighton.<\/p>\n
            <p>
              Last year they ran a day of screenings that traversed the decades
              from the Thirties to the Seventies. It was fascinating to watch an
              intricate snapshot of women in horror unfolding before me,
              reflective of Hollywood&#8217;s complex relationship with
              sexuality, equality, objectification and empowerment.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              In just the five films screened &#8211;
              <strong
                >Mad Love<\/strong>,
                <strong
                  >The Cat People<\/strong>,
                  <strong
                    >Them<\/strong>,
                    <strong
                      >Plague of the Zombies<\/strong> and
                      <strong
                        >Phantasm<\/strong> &#8211; a gamut of femininity was
                        presented, from virginal innocent to sexual seductress,
                        strident powerful woman to flailing damsel in distress,
                        repressed lesbian to swooning romantic.<\/p>\n
                        <p>
                          In almost all these films there is a notable slide
                          towards objectification; the woman\u2019s body as a
                          object of desire for the monster or mad scientist, the
                          virginal sacrificial lamb, or the slutty cannon fodder
                          helpless to avert her fate. This is reflective of the
                          wider problems within a genre that still churns out
                          women&#8217;s bodies to be fondled, fucked, kidnapped
                          and sliced up.<\/p>\n

                              objectifying genres, but is also an important
                              genre for exploring a vast array of issues &#8211;
                              power, psyche, politics, social constructs, war,

                              it\u2019s important that women\u2019s roles are

                                massive area to dig into. There\u2019s been a
                                swathe of material written about women as
                                survivors in horror films &#8211; they occupy a
                                myriad of roles: the Final Girl, the matriarch
                                (all hail Ellen Ripley!), the victim who finds
                                her nerve and the avenging angel survivor
                                &#8211; frequently a victim of sexual violence.

                                It\u2019s a rich seam to explore, and
                                there\u2019s a whole other vein to mine
                                exploring the ones who live and the ones who die
                                in horror movies, and what this represents
                                metaphorically, culturally and politically.
                                Equally, there\u2019s a huge area to address
                                when it comes to representations of race in
                                horror &#8211; for example, why the last one to
                                live is often a white woman (think

                                  about when women themselves are the stuff of
                                  nightmares?<\/p>\n

                                    Women aren&#8217;t always the victims in
                                    horror, and whilst there have been
                                    significant problems in the history of the
                                    genre, it has also been willing to explore
                                    areas of female experience that other genres
                                    just weren&#8217;t ready for, often at times
                                    when it would have been deeply contentious
                                    to make a film that discussed, say,
                                    sexuality or sexual violence, let alone the
                                    fact that you\u2019d still be hard pushed to
                                    find a film about what a nightmare getting
                                    your period can be! There are numerous
                                    examples of fantastic writing and
                                    performances in horror that explore the

                                      the abiding social currents, as well as

                                          cure herself of vampirism. She tries

                                          The film barely contains its sapphic
                                          undertones. Zaleska lingers over her
                                          female victims, covets their bodies
                                          and beauty, and prowls the streets at
                                          night in search of blood. The countess
                                          is very much a creature of her time in
                                          cinematic history, reflecting both the
                                          notion that homosexuality was
                                          considered a psychiatric malaise, and

                                          cinema, reflecting religious and
                                          conservative views that any deviant
                                          behaviour had to be hidden, including
                                          sexual acts, prostitution, white
                                          slavery and homosexuality. The film is
                                          also a shining example of the
                                          demonisation of homosexuality, the
                                          portrayal of lesbians as predatory and
                                          dangerous and this is reflected in the
                                          scene where Zaleska attacks a young

                                            the surface, however, is the secret
                                            that she is descended from a wild

                                            will lose control and turn into a

                                              the power in a woman unleashing
                                              her sexuality. There is also a
                                              queer subtext as Irena stalks her
                                              husband&#8217;s mistress, Alice,
                                              and her inner cat is unleashed,
                                              suggesting that the repression she
                                              felt was her sexuality rather than
                                              her lack of ardour for her
