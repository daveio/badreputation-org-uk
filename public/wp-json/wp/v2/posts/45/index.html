      Four Legs Good<\/h2>\n
      <p>
        The four-letter word that isn&#8217;t a four letter word, at least
        properly a
        <em
          >bitch<\/em> has four legs. As anyone who&#8217;s ever tittered at
          Cruft&#8217;s will be only too aware, the glory of bitch is that, like
          <em
            >gay<\/em>, it has a meaning unrelated to human sexuality in many
            circles. Hence its first meaning, &#8216;the female of the
            dog&#8217;, originating in Middle English and Old Norse. The
            dictionary extends its potential out a bit: you can, it insists,
            have other types of bitch creature (e.g., &#8216;bitch fox&#8217;)
            as long as you specify. Bitch aardvark; bitch turtle (I
            hope).<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_64\" style=\"width: 289px\"

              But, with typical ingratitude to Man&#8217;s Best Friend, the
              human race quickly (well, by the fourteenth century) started using
              <em
                >dog<\/em> to mean all the juicy olde worlde insults \u2013
                &#8216;worthless fellow&#8217;, &#8216;traitor&#8217;,
                &#8216;low cur&#8217;, &#8216;coward&#8217;, etc. \u2013 with
                the implication being that a four-legged
                <em
                  >dog<\/em> only thinks of its survival and has no interest in
                  Elevated Human Ideals like honour, dignity, nobility, etc.
                  <em
                    >Bitch<\/em> is the female of the species in every sense,
                    so, while
                    <em
                      >dog<\/em> is connected with male inadequacy and
                      primitivism,
                      <em
                        >bitch<\/em> attacks women on that most unoriginal of

                        <p>
                          Enter the second, and probably most commonly
                          understood use of the term: its opprobrious
                          application to women. The Oxford English Dictionary
                          (OED to you and me) initially sticks to the rather
                          conservative definition &#8216;a lewd or sensual
                          woman&#8217;, adding sternly &#8216;Not now in decent
                          use&#8217;, although it then extends the term to mean
                          &#8216;a malicious or treacherous woman&#8217; or,
                          more generally, an &#8216;outstandingly difficult or
                          unpleasant&#8217; <span style=\"text-decoration:

                          allusion to the proverbial aggression of mothering
                          animals. But why do these sexual meanings keep
                          cropping up? The answer lies in the Dim And Distant
                          Past.<\/p>\n

                            When these terms begin to be bandied about in the
                            1300s, the crucial point is that that much-touted
                            Man On The Street would probably have said that men
                            were spiritual, closer-to-God beings, while their
                            wives were, well, Closer To God in the <a

                            Reznorian<\/a> sense. There was a very simple reason
                            for this: physically speaking, women can, er,
                            <em
                              >last <\/em>longer than men. &#8216;What is
                              this?&#8217; their husbands cry, &#8216;I&#8217;ve
                              had enough \u2013 That&#8217;s all anyone should
                              need! Womankind is dangerously lecherous!&#8217;
                              Moreover, since Man had been created first (and in
                              God&#8217;s image) he was some way towards
                              divinity already, but the daughters of Eve were
                              far from such exalted regions. They were really
                              just a higher kind of animal: Adam had, after all,
                              been given dominion over his wife along with the
                              birds and beasts.<\/p>\n
                              <p>
                                So female lechery could quickly become perceived
                                as a primitive, animalistic trait that the
                                forces of humanity \u2013 and the superior
                                self-restraint of men \u2013 were always trying
                                to overcome. And

                                  >bitch<\/em> emerges as evidence of such a
                                  view, since just as
