    >The followers of Dionysus were called the Maenads &#8211; the &#8216;raving
    ones&#8217;. During worship, and through a combination of alcohol and
    ritualistic dancing, Dionysus would inspire in these women a state of
    ecstatic frenzy.\u00a0So inspired, they would roam in a state of madness,
    engaging in uncontrolled sexual behaviour, tearing apart animals (and
    sometimes humans) with their bare hands and devouring the raw
    flesh.<\/em><\/p>\n
    <h3>
      And so into the Eighties&#8230;<\/h3>\n
      <p>
        During the Eighties, there was a Fitness Craze among the baby-boomers,
        who &#8216;<a href=\"http:\/\/eightiesclub.tripod.com\/id314.htm\">from
        trying to improve society, [in the 60s and 70s&#8230;] turned to
        improving themselves<\/a>&#8216;. There can be no more evocative symbol
        of this than Jane Fonda and her striped leotard, although hers was
        a\u00a0<a
        href=\"http:\/\/goretro.blogspot.com\/2011\/09\/80s-fitness-craze.html\">comparatively
        straight-edge style compared to some<\/a>. \u00a0Let&#8217;s pause to
        take a look at the opening to\u00a0<strong
          >Jane Fonda&#8217;s\u00a0Workout<\/strong> (released in 1982). It
          looks a little bit like a dark and threatening Exercise Cult. Even the
          music is vaguely sinister:<\/p>\n
          <p>

          </p>
          <p>
            It feels a bit like that to do the workout. Jane ain&#8217;t taking
            no crap, and the video is punctuated with whoops of enthusiasm and
            the occasional yelp of pain from her exercise minions &#8211; one of
            whom, Leslie, is\u00a0<a
            href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=HU1FUzrM3Fs\">even invited
            down front to sing Jane&#8217;s very own personal song<\/a>,
            &#8216;Do It&#8217;. Leslie appeared in a few more of Fonda&#8217;s
            workout videos, unlike the\u00a0<a

              evidence that this guy ever existed, bar a fuzzy image in the
              video above, so the latter link &#8211; with its excellent
              headgear &#8211; will have to suffice.)<\/p>\n

                  Speaking of that dude, I&#8217;ve never understood if the men
                  in the back row are there as misguided eye candy while you
                  sweat it out, or if they&#8217;re intended to demonstrate that
                  the workout is suitable for all genders. Have a think about
                  that one.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n
                </p>
                <h3>
                  Do It Yourself<\/h3>\n
                  <p>
                    The &#8216;New Workout&#8217; was the first of 23 workout
                    videos Fonda released and, apparently, the best-selling home
                    video ever made (17 million copies sold). It&#8217;s hardly
                    surprising: the DIY formula was a seductive one for (in
                    particular) many American baby-boomer housewives, who were
                    just beginning to own the new and exciting VCR-machine.
                    Indeed, this exercise-at-home option contrasts curiously
                    with these housewives&#8217; stereotypical Victorian
                    counterparts, all\u00a0<a
                    href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/2010\/10\/18\/an-alphabet-of-femininism-3-c-is-for-crinoline\/\">inactivity,
                    crinolines and restrictive corsets<\/a>. Fashion follows
                    money, so the trophy wives of the 1980s would be as likely
                    to flaunt their husbands&#8217; wealth with lycra, fitness
                    gadgets and gyms as elegant laziness; keeping trim between
                    cleaning the house and nuking something for dinner.<\/p>\n
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Another explanation is the quality of the workout itself:
                    there&#8217;s a pleasing sense of female\u00a0camaraderie on
                    Jane&#8217;s workouts &#8211; she&#8217;s occasionally
                    ironic, and consistently determined that you should smile
                    while you do your umpteenth set of sit ups (I never knew it
                    was possible for your abs to hurt post-workout, but I was
                    ignorant). At peak moments she shouts &#8216;Come on! If I
                    can do it, you can do it!&#8217;, apparently forgetting that
                    she trained as a professional ballet dancer, whereas we, her
                    viewers, are more likely to be professional slobs. She
                    believes in you!<\/p>\n

                  <h3>
                    Running Wild<\/h3>\n
                    <p>
                      That said, she&#8217;s also MAD &#8211; look at\u00a0<a
                      href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=KOYihkG3PEQ&amp;feature=related\">the
                      &#8216;cool down&#8217; section<\/a>\u00a0of the
                      &#8216;Advanced&#8217; workout for evidence.
                      Rumours\u00a0that she was filming the video on a diet of
                      espresso, ice cream and cocaine remain unconfirmed, but
                      she&#8217;s certainly on some kind of drug, even if just
                      adrenaline. She drives her mob onwards, onwards, always
                      onwards, and I always think there&#8217;s something
                      vaguely\u00a0Maenadic\u00a0about the hoots and howls of
                      pain she elicits from her class.<\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      However, looking at similar videos of the time it seems
                      that such a frenzied approach to exercise was completely
                      normal: in the Canadian TV series\u00a0<strong
                        >20-Minute Workout<\/strong> (1983-4), the instructions
                        are shouted out by Bess &#8216;Aerobics Queen&#8217;
                        Motta almost as parts of a ritualistic cowboy song. The
                        overall effect is unsettling, if not completely
                        hypnotic:<\/p>\n

                              spin-off).\u00a0For some reason, at this point she
                              seems to require two versions of herself to work
                              out with simultaneously. It gets very weird from
                              about 2:40 onwards, at which point the line
                              between &#8216;exercise-at-home cardio
                              workout&#8217; and &#8216;strangely synchronised
                              proto-American Apparel soft porn&#8217; becomes
                              blurred to say the very least:<\/p>\n

                                Both these are filmed with a pizazz lacking in
                                Jane Fonda&#8217;s no-nonsense camerawork and
                                they perhaps explain why, though Bess may have
                                been Aerobics Queen, Jane was the
                                housewives&#8217; favourite. These are so
                                lacking in practicality that they&#8217;re
