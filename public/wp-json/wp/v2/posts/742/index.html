  Everyone has a favourite cyborg, right? Well mine is Alita, from Yukito
  Kushiro\u2019s manga series
  <strong
    ><a title=\"Wikipedia - Battle Angel Alita\"
    href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Battle_Angel_Alita\"
    target=\"_self\">Battle Angel Alita<\/a><\/strong>. She is a strong female
    character in both senses of the word: strong because she\u2019s brave,
    independent, tough, smart and compassionate, but also in the enjoyable
    \u2018I-can-punch-your-head-off\u2019 way.<\/div>\n
    <h3>
      What\u2019s the story?<\/h3>\n
      <div>
        The series is set in a 26th century dystopia, and revolves around the
        city of Scrapyard, grown up around a massive heap of rubbish that rains
        down from Tiphares, a mysterious city floating above. \u2018Surface
        dwellers\u2019 are barred from Tiphares, and must make lives for
        themselves amid the scrap. Alita is found in the garbage heap by
        cybernetics doctor and part-time bounty hunter Daisuke Ido, who rebuilds
        her body and takes care of her. She remembers nothing about who she was
        or how she came to be in the Scrapyard, but she does discover a talent
        for killing which leads her to join Ido as a bounty hunter. The story
        continues over nine volumes as Alita attempts to rediscover her past and
        struggles to reconcile her identity as girl and killer, human and
        machine, individual and soldier.<\/div>\n<div id=\"attachment_750\"

          So far, so Nineties. So why am I writing about
          <strong
            >Battle Angel Alita<\/strong> now? Well, because <a title=\"IMDb -
            James Cameron\" href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/name\/nm0000116\/\"
            target=\"_self\">James Cameron<\/a> is about to start making a live
            action\/CGI film adaption of it and I want AS MANY PEOPLE AS
            POSSIBLE to read it before that happens. While there\u2019s a lot to
            love in Cameron\u2019s films, I am concerned he\u2019s going to turn
            an intelligent, philosophical and political story about identity
            into Hot Robot Chick (With A Heart Of Gold) Kicks Ass In The
            Future.<\/div>\n
            <h3>
              Genderfun<\/h3>\n
              <div>
                First of all, Alita is no balloon-breasted manga stereotype
                \u2013 while she does have an unnaturally &#8216;perfect&#8217;
                body and is beautiful in a childlike way, she is very rarely
                drawn in an overtly sexual style, and spends most of her time
                fully clothed, often in a trenchcoat and suitably stompy
                boots.<\/div>\n
                <div>
                  Secondly, though tiny and feminine (at times, anyway) she is
                  supremely strong, still a powerful cultural dream in a world
                  where violence against women is epidemic. Refreshingly she
                  rarely relies on guns, instead using a cyborg martial art
                  &#8211; sidestepping the \u2018bigger than yours\u2019
                  approach to women kicking ass.<\/div>\n
                  <div>
                    Thirdly, the series further departs from convention with a
                    powerful female protagonist that a) never uses her beauty,
                    sexuality or other feminine wiles to get the upper hand and
                    b) is never raped or nearly raped or avenging somebody
                    else\u2019s rape.<\/div>\n
                    <div>
                      That said, the series does explore issues around bodily
                      integrity, control over the boundaries of the self and the
                      intimate operations of power, and there is a definite
                      gendered aspect to this. For example, at one point
                      troubled genius and desert DJ (yes, DJ &#8211; it&#8217;s
                      complicated&#8230;) Kaos saves Alita\u2019s life by
                      repairing her body and she wakes up naked on an operating
                      table with his hand inside her.<\/div>\n
                      <div>
                        I\u2019m not saying that
                        <strong
                          >Battle Angel Alita<\/strong> is a feminist work, or
                          that it will be everyone\u2019s cup of tea \u2013 it
                          is extraordinarily violent, for one thing. For another
                          it is inescapably problematic that Alita derives her
                          physical strength from mechanical bodies created or
                          enhanced by men &#8211; Ido, Kaos and mad scientist
                          Desty Nova. Nonetheless, when the chips are down she
                          is often saved by her resourcefulness and her
                          connections with others.<\/div>\n

                              In the last few books her key relationships are
                              with women &#8211; her Tipharean
                              \u2018operator\u2019 Lou and 13 year old
                              professional gambler Kokomi. At the start Lou is
                              everything Alita isn&#8217;t &#8211; silly,
                              chatty, timid &#8211; but she is inspired to a
                              tremendous act of rebellion to save her
                              friend&#8217;s life. Kokomi is also inspired by
                              Alita, and though they end up fighting on
                              different sides she is similarly independent,
                              brave and rebellious.<\/div>\n

                                Another thing I love about Alita is that
                                although she is a powerful and inspiring female
                                character there is nothing maternal about her
                                impulse to protect others. Her power is not
                                rooted in her female identity because her
                                \u2018femaleness\u2019 is superficial. And in my
                                opinion the real triumph is that she is not like
                                a man either. She has masculine and feminine
                                qualities, but neither is she purely
                                androgynous.<\/div>\n

                                            never a whole identity but a partial

                                            are made of myriad aspects and
                                            intersecting experiences, part
                                            natural-biological and part
                                            social-cultural construct. Haraway
                                            sees a way through this old problem
                                            of collective action by suggesting a
                                            cyborg feminism which finds its
                                            common ground in a desire to resist
                                            and subvert a patriarchal system and
                                            not in a shared female
                                            identity.<\/div>\n

                                              Haraway famously concludes her
                                              Manifesto with the words
                                              \u201cI\u2019d rather be a cyborg
                                              than a goddess.\u201d I have
                                              nothing against goddesses (on the
                                              contrary, they rawk) but linking

                                              their bodies is a dangerous

                                                Alita is radically free from
                                                biological determinism in the
                                                way that only a cyborg can be.
                                                Every part of her is completely
                                                remade or regenerated in the
                                                course of the series, only her
                                                consciousness remains
                                                continuous. She is not her body,
                                                she is not even her brain. Alita
                                                is her memories and her
                                                relationships, her actions and
                                                her
                                                choices.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div
