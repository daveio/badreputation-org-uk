  I\u2019ll come clean: I missed most of Ladyfest Ten. And I missed it because I
  was hungover, on about a thimbleful of wine. But one of the things I did
  actually manage to see that weekend was the excellent US pro-choice

        Towards the end of the film there was a section about the
        \u2018reproductive justice\u2019 movement. The interviews intrigued me.
        It looked exciting, radical, inclusive and even kinda fun. The film
        featured an endearing group of smart, funny, young activists that
        reminded me of the<strong>

                    Reproductive justice is a holistic, inclusive and
                    intersectional campaign for reproductive rights and the
                    conditions necessary for women to realize them. It is a
                    movement led by women of colour, which addresses the right
                    to have children as well as the right not to have children,
                    expanding the focus out from abortion to include wider
                    questions of sex education, sexuality, birth control and the
                    impact of poverty and violence.\u00a0 This video is a good

                                movement? Although abortion has been legal since
                                1967, and in theory it is freely available on
                                the NHS, there are major inequalities in access.

                                      Abortion is available on the NHS, but only
                                      if you obtain two doctors&#8217;
                                      signatures. This can be difficult if you
                                      live in an area with only one GP who is
                                      anti-abortion. Access to abortion services
                                      can be as much of a postcode lottery as
                                      any other service in the UK&#8230; This
                                      can make things more difficult for women
                                      as not only does the procedure become more
                                      invasive the further into pregnancy one
                                      gets, but not all clinics perform
                                      abortions up to the legal limit. This
                                      means some women opt to pay privately for
                                      abortions to avoid wait times, where other
                                      women have to wait until further in
                                      pregnancy and\/or travel great distances
                                      to obtain the care they

                                      the previous government, things have
                                      improved: 94% of abortions are now funded
                                      by the NHS, and waiting times have been
                                      drastically reduced. However, these
                                      achievements, like many others, are likely
                                      to be lost as vicious spending cuts

                                      circumstances. So every year in order to

                                      of women are forced to travel to England

                                      There\u2019s also a major problem around

                                      abortion. Many young women are effectively
                                      prevented from making an informed decision
                                      because they are misinformed at school, or
                                      receive biased advice from bogus

                                        ethnicity in Britain as in the US, there
                                        are some patterns. For example,
                                        according to Department of Health stats,
                                        black British women are almost three
                                        times more likely to have an abortion
                                        than white women (<a title=\"Department

                                          The argument advanced in the US is
                                          that because minority ethnic women are
                                          more likely to experience poverty and
                                          economic disadvantage, the abortion
                                          rate among these communities is
                                          therefore higher. The Department of
                                          Health in England and Wales does not
                                          include income levels in its abortion
                                          statistics, but Scotland does, and
                                          their figures regularly show that
                                          abortion rates are higher in
                                          economically disadvantaged

                                          As Darinka points out, there is a
                                          similar discrepancy in US abortion
                                          statistics, and there\u2019s more in
                                          Part 2 about how this is being used by
                                          the anti-choice movement in America
