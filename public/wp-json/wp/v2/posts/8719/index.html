        Innocence and Sexualisation<\/h3>\n
        <p>
          The vigour with which some people are prepared to attack moves towards
          more open, honest and comprehensive sex and relationships education is
          baffling. What are they so afraid of? Educating young people about
          safer sex doesn\u2019t lead to an increased sexual activity
          (that\u2019s from this great <a
          href=\"http:\/\/www.avert.org\/aids-young-people.htm\">Avert
          resource<\/a>, by the way). Two words that pop up fairly regularly in
          the fog of general objection are \u2018innocence\u2019 and
          \u2018sexualisation\u2019. I think they\u2019re masking other, simpler
          causes for so much reactionary guff, but let\u2019s have a look at
          them anyway.<\/p>\n

          of children must be protected at all costs is absurd. Innocence in the
          criminal sense is a good thing to hold on to, of course. But innocence
          in the wafty Victorian lamblike sense (aka \u201cfreedom from guilt or
          sin through being unacquainted with evil\u201d)?.\u00a0 I fail to see
          the value of being \u2018unacquainted with evil\u2019. Knowing about
          sex isn\u2019t the same as having sex. And also: SEX ISN\u2019T EVIL,
          GUYS. Besides, it\u2019s a bit of a risk, if you ask me, turning
          someone loose in the world if they have no concept of evil.
          They\u2019re in for a nasty shock and quite possibly some dangerous or
          exploitative situations. Likewise someone who has been kept in the
          dark about pregnancy, STIs or abuse. Even if you\u2019re working with
          some kind of arcane points-based system of morality, how can you get
          your approval for being without sin just because you don\u2019t know
          what sin is? That\u2019s like congratulating someone on not eating the
          cookies they didn\u2019t know were there.<\/p>\n

        <p>
          Anyway, that\u2019s enough poptheology. Next:
          \u2018sexualisation\u2019, on which I basically agree with <a
          href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/commentisfree\/2010\/aug\/09\/stop-this-slut-shaming\">Laurie
          Penny<\/a> that the word is a \u201ctroubling piece of cultural
          shorthand\u201d which<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            suggests that sexuality is something that is done to young women,
            rather than something that they can own and control: that they can
            never be sexual, only sexualised. This is not a helpful message to
            send to girls as they begin to explore their sexuality.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            The moral panic over &#8220;sexualisation&#8221; assumes instead
            that sex is only ever damaging to young women, and that having sex
            or behaving sexually must be resisted for as long as possible. The
            problem is not, however, that young women are &#8220;growing up too
            fast&#8221; \u2013 rather it is that they are growing up to
            understand that they are erotic commodities, there to be used and
            abused, shamed if they express legitimate desires of their own, and
            taught to fear their own bodies.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n

                    <p>
                      Critics of broader sex education have done a pretty good
                      job of cosying up to some quarters of the feminist
                      movement, and I\u2019d love to believe that concern over
                      women or children\u2019s wellbeing lay at the heart of the
                      <a

                      Review<\/a> and the media outrage. But it doesn\u2019t.
                      Sexual conservatism is shorthand for a certain kind of
                      morality, and this is a holier-than-thou contest fuelled
                      by the crippling shame and squeamishness about sex that is
                      our shared cultural inheritance. That\u2019s why we feel
                      the need to keep any notion of sex away from children for
                      as long as possible, because on some level, we do think
                      there\u2019s something bad about sex. What other
                      explanation can there be? An otherwise sensible, right-on
                      and feminist former manager of mine once insisted we end a
                      teabreak conversation about how often you should have a
                      sexual health checkup, saying &#8220;Can you just stop
                      talking about it please? It makes me feel all
                      ewwww.&#8221;<\/p>\n

                    <p>
                      Well, feeling &#8216;ewwww&#8217; has created a dangerous
                      situation. Without giving children and teenagers a safe
                      space in which to discuss and learn about sex,
                      relationships and sexuality we are creating a vacuum that
                      will be filled by three things: a) whatever their parents
                      choose to tell them; b) all the shit teenagers talk to
                      each other; and c) ideas about sex derived solely from
                      cultural representations of it. Advertising and porn are
                      the big guns here. The version of sex in most porn and
                      advertising isn\u2019t particularly safe, consensual,
                      varied, respectful or even likely to be that much fun
                      (good luck to any women planning on having an orgasm) and
                      the additional messages it peddles about gender identity,
                      power, race and sexual orientation are pretty
                      unhelpful.<\/p>\n

                        this is a public health issue. Although last year there
                        was a small decrease in the total number of STIs

                        highest rates of STIs overall. In 2008, the UN reported
                        that globally only 40% of young people aged 15-24 had
                        accurate knowledge about HIV and transmission, while the
                        same group accounted for 45% of all new HIV infections.
                        SRE also presents an opportunity to undermine the stigma
                        faced by people living with HIV through education about
                        transmission without moral judgement. (Stats from <a
