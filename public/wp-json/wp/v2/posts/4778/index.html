  <p>
    Winning is great, sure, but if you are really going to do something in life,
    the secret is learning how to lose. Nobody goes undefeated all the time. If
    you can pick up after a crushing defeat, and go on to win again, you are
    going to be a champion someday.<\/p>\n

        The 1960 Summer Olympics, the first to be broadcast internationally (the
        1948 games had been aired by the BBC, but only in London), helped launch
        the fame of one of the world\u2019s best known athletes, Cassius Clay.
        But this post is about someone else who competed that year: the woman
        who would become known as \u201cthe Tornado\u201d and \u201cLa Gazella
        Negra\u201d, Wilma Glodean Rudolph (June 23, 1940 \u2013 November 12
        1994).<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        Rudolph was not the most likely choice to become one of the best runners
        of her generation. The 20th in a family of 22 children, she was a
        premature birth, weighing only 4.5lbs. Racial segregation in the US at
        the time prevented Wilma from being treated at the local hospital, and
        the poverty caused by the Great Depression made it financially difficult
        for her family to take her elsewhere. Throughout her childhood her
        mother had to nurse her through measles, mumps, scarlet fever, whooping
        cough, chickenpox, and pneumonia.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        The disease that had the most impact on her chances of athletic stardom,
        however, was polio, which left her partially paralysed and with a
        twisted left leg. It seemed unlikely that she would be able to walk
        again, let alone run. Wilma, however, was far too tenacious to be slowed
        down by a little thing like polio and childhood paralysis. Through a
        combination of intense physical therapy, corrective shoes, and a metal
        leg brace, Wilma regained the ability to walk unaided by the age of
        twelve.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          My doctor told me I would never walk again. My mother told me I would.
          I believed my mother.<\/p>\n
        </p>

            <p>
              No stranger to physical training by this point, Wilma decided to
              follow in the path of one of her older sisters and take up
              basketball. She excelled at the sport, setting state records for
              scoring, and catching the attention of Edward Temple &#8211; the
              track and field coach for Tennessee State University. She had some
              track experience already from high school athletics classes, and
              by 1956, aged 16, she was running to a high enough standard to
              have a spot on the US Olympic team for the 1956 games in
              Melbourne, where she picked up a bronze medal.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              Four years beforehand she\u2019d been unable to walk unaided, and
              four years before that she was being told by doctors that
              she\u2019d never walk at all. Now she was an Olympic medallist. Of
              course, someone who overcomes polio through sheer determination
              isn\u2019t the sort of person who settles for a mere bronze medal.
              In 1960 Wilma returned to the Olympics for the Rome games and
              landed no less than three gold medals, the first American woman to
              do so. She set a world record for the 200m sprint at 23.2 seconds,
              and one for the 400m relay with her teammates <a

              victory go from a regular badass achievement to a triple-decker
              pile of brilliance, however, was what she did afterwards. Upon
              returning to Clarksville, Tennessee, with her medals, a homecoming
              parade was arranged in her honour. She insisted the parade be an
              integrated event, where previous such occasions had always been
              segregated. Her banquet was the first time in the city\u2019s
              history that a large meal was held without segregation. After
              this, Wilma joined the protests that took place in the city until
              segregation laws were struck down.<\/p>\n

              You want to hear about more awesomeness? Hopefully you do, because
              Wilma Rudolph still had plenty more of it to deliver. Her athletic
              excellence had earned her a full scholarship at Tennessee State
              University, you see, where she earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in
              education. She taught for a while at her own former high school,
              followed by schools in Maine and Indiana. In 1967 she was asked by
              the then Vice President of the US, Hubert Humphrey, to take part
              in an athletic outreach programme aimed at underprivileged
              children living in housing projects in several major cities. When
              the programme ended she established her own non-profit
              organisation, the Wilma Rudolph Foundation, to continue the work.
              The foundation provided free coaching, academic assistance and
              personal support to kids in deprived areas.<\/p>\n
