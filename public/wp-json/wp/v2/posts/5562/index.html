      Argentina, during the period from 1976-1983, was not a good place to look
      even remotely like a dissident. The era, known as the \u2018<a
      href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dirty_War\">Dirty War<\/a>\u2019,
      saw widespread violence carried out by <a

      against those it perceived as enemies of the state \u2013 students,

      were rife, and somewhere between 9,000 and 30,000 people were forcibly
      disappeared, leaving no official trace of their fates.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      This set the stage for the formation of a group known as the
      <strong
        >Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo<\/strong>, named for the plaza in central
        Buenos Aires where they first gathered. The Mothers are one of the more
        interesting protest movements of the late 20th century, and also a bunch
        of remarkable badasses. <\/p>\n
        <p>
          Formed in 1977, the Mothers set out to pressure the government into
          admitting the fates of their disappeared children, the <a
          href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Desaparecidos\">Desaparecidos<\/a>.
          On the 30th of April that year sixteen women gathered outside the
          presidential palace to stage a demonstration, demanding to know what
          had happened to theirs sons and daughters. Consider that this was
          right in the middle of the Dirty War, when state-sponsored death
          squads were meting out harsh discipline pretty much with impunity. How
          staggeringly brave and determined do you have to be, at a time like
          that, to march up to the presidential palace and demand answers? This
          isn\u2019t a movement that formed years later, in safety under a
          civilian government \u2013 they stood up to the military junta right
          from the start, despite the risks.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_5563\"

          In a time when the government sought to isolate individuals, to
          separate and control people through application of terror, the Mothers
          gave a unified voice. They acted publicly, sharing their stories,
          gathering others to their cause. It was by no means a safe or easy
          course of action (fully one quarter of the founding Mothers were also
          disappeared before the junta left power in 1983), but they managed to
          grow a movement that is still going.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            The ongoing work of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo has not gone on
            unnoticed. It has earned them international awards from bodies such
            as UNESCO and the European Parliament. It has also been met with
            harassment and repression. Three of the organization\u2019s founding
            members have joined the ranks of the disappeared since its work
            began.<\/p>\n
          </p>

              <p>
                Since the fall of the junta and the return to civilian
                government, the pressure exerted by the Mothers has resulted in
                several hundred of the missing being identified, or their
                remains found. Many younger children turned out to have been
                given to adoptive loyalist families, and the Mothers have acted
                as intermediaries to help these children come to terms with
                their pasts and interact with both their adoptive and birth
                families.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                Beyond just finding the missing, many of the Mothers have seen
                it as their duty to carry on the dreams of their children, to
                live for the causes that got them taken in the first place. To
                this end the group has grown to encompass other political
                causes, including the founding of a university, libraries and
                bookshops, and the provision of healthcare subsidies.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                What makes the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo particularly
                interesting is the boundary-crossing nature of their protest. A
                lot of activist movements and protest campaigns become
                unfortunately mired in divisions, locking out valuable voices
                (see the refusal by key female American activists to accept the
                black suffrage movement in the early 20th century, or the
                frequent erasure of trans* and non-white issues among a lot of
                modern groups). The Mothers, by contrast, brought together
                several spheres of Argentinean culture. <\/p>\n<div

                Active in the central business areas of Buenos Aires, and by all
                accounts an urban movement, they nevertheless counted many rural
                Argentinians amongst their number. Age divides were crossed too,
                with a Grandmothers division of the group who continued the work
                of their kidnapped children, and looked after the offspring of
                disappeared Mothers.<\/p>\n

              <p>
                Following the return to civilian government in 1983, and the <a

                of the Juntas<\/a> in \u201985, the Mothers went international.
                Argentina hadn\u2019t been the only South American country to
                disappear dissidents during that time (see: <a
                href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Operation_Condor\">Operation
                Condor<\/a>), and the Mothers sought to bring international
                pressure down on countries that still hadn\u2019t come clean
                about their activities, particularly the Pinochet regime in

                  interest and solidarity from people in other parts of the
                  world. It was an extraordinarily positive experience. We have
                  had support from the women\u2019s movement, from the CHA

                        The Mothers are still active today, still working for

                        unaccounted for, and still promoting the ideals and
