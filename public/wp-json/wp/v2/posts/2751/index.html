<p>There are many ways to make a film about witches.<\/p>\n</p>
<p>
  Firstly, you can make a straight-up witch film.\u00a0 You know, with a spooky
  young woman with a drippy curtain of hair over her face, glowering out from
  heavy eyelids, muttering to herself to make stuff go on fire and horses stress
  out.\u00a0 A
  <em
    >proper<\/em> witch film.\u00a0 With at least one scene of crows taking off
    from a forest and yelling.\u00a0 It&#8217;ll be insidious and creepy, a
    spine-crawling exploration of subtle witchery and spooky magic that&#8217;ll
    end in the witch being vanquished and a sort of bleak conclusion as we all
    examine our ideas of the supernatural.\u00a0 Something like <a
    href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Blair_Witch_Project\"><strong
      >The Blair Witch Project<\/strong><\/a>, to pick an obvious
      example.<\/p>\n
      <p>
        Secondly, you can make a film that&#8217;s hyper-aware of the cruelty of
        witch trials and is cynical to the bone; the horror seeping in from our
        horrified examination of how cruel humans can be to each other when
        given a modicum of authority and a healthily heaped serving of
        paranoia.\u00a0 You can also spice up this trope by having a nice wade
        through an examination of religion&#8217;s hand in the instigation of
        human cruelty.\u00a0 The classic example of this trope is the 1996 film
        version of <a
        href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Crucible_%281996_film%29\"><strong
          >The Crucible<\/strong><\/a>, as we all know &#8211; a fine
          film.\u00a0 A fine film indeed.<\/p>\n
          <p>
            Thirdly, you can do an all-out schlock-horror gore-and-monsters fest
            where things sprout wings, raise the dead and have An Eville
            Laughe.\u00a0 Something like <a
            href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Van_Helsing_%28film%29\"><strong
              >Van Helsing<\/strong><\/a>.\u00a0 Something where there&#8217;s
              no realism to speak of, and you&#8217;re in it for the rollicking
              monster fights and stabbination.<\/p>\n

                  <p>
                    And you know, blow me, it failed in
                    <em
                      >every single conceivable way<\/em>.\u00a0 I thought that
                      it might be able to do something right.\u00a0 It
                      didn&#8217;t.\u00a0 It didn&#8217;t at all.\u00a0 It was

                            The films starts with Some Women being accused of
                            witchcraft and flung over a bridge and hanged.
                            &#8220;Oh, I see,&#8221; I thought, as the priest
                            pronounced them worthy of hanging despite tearful,
                            desperate confessions.\u00a0&#8220;This&#8217;ll be
                            an Examination of the Church&#8217;s
                            Cruelty.&#8221;<\/p>\n
                          </p>

                            Then, we jump to THE TIME OF THE CRUSADES, where

                                fighting Staracens in Stamascus on the way to
                                Sterusalem which had defied the laws of
                                steographical stysics and raised in staltitude,
                                altering its stlimate beyond repair.\u00a0 And
                                they are, I assume, Knights Stemplar.\u00a0 Or
                                of the Steutonic Order of &#8211; okay,

                                  But despite the prolonged, stupidly-costumed

                                                \u00a0The race failure is

                                                non-insulting way, but
                                                it&#8217;s a very difficult and
                                                horrible era to handle at all,
                                                what with the inherent
                                                colonially-minded, racist nature
                                                of the conflict in the first
