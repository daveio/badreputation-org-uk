  I am supposed to be writing about
  <strong
    >Bioshock Infinite<\/strong> right now (which is amazing and you should all
    play it right bloody now) but then, something happened.<\/p>\n

      Something long-awaited, occasionally hoaxed, but nobody was ever entirely
      sure would ever come to pass&#8230;THE SUN CAME OUT AND SPRING ARRIVED IN

      And lo, the internet did have a field day. Twitter was a maelstrom of
      popping corks, whitewashing of one of the darkest times post-war Britain
      has faced, and joyous choruses of\u00a0<em

        of disgust for every aspect of the reaction. The 8<sup

            The
            <strong
              >New Statesman<\/strong> ran a brief and to-the-point piece about
              whether or not Thatcher\u00a0<a
              href=\"http:\/\/www.newstatesman.com\/archive\/2013\/04\/margaret-thatcher-feminist-icon\"
              target=\"_blank\">could or should be considered a feminist
              icon<\/a>. In the words of the Iron Lady herself, \u201cI hate
              feminism. It is poison.\u201d<\/p>\n
              <p>
                So far, so cut-and-dry. But her words have been niggling at me
                somewhat. She&#8217;s not the first woman to denounce and
                distance herself from feminism. Nor will she be the last. But I
                cannot help but wonder what would drive a woman who would never
                have reached her position without feminism to speak out against
                it with such contempt.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                While we can now only speculate on why her personal views were
                what they were, I&#8217;m reminded of a few arguments I hear
                with disheartening frequency about why feminism isn&#8217;t
                needed and why feminists need to shut up.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                Spoilers: I am neither moved nor convinced by any of
                them.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong
                  >1.<\/strong> \u201c<b
                    >I don&#8217;t need feminism. We have the vote. It&#8217;s
                    done. Women are totes equal. Get over it.<\/b>\u201d<\/p>\n
                    <p>
                      This line of reasoning barely dignifies a response beyond
                      pointing out, somewhat wearily, that it&#8217;s
                      demonstrably untrue. Whether we&#8217;re talking pay gaps,
                      sexual abuse, street harassment, representation in
                      politics, assumptions about childcare arrangements or
                      anything else in an endless list of smaller inequalities
                      adding up to a great big unequal world. Yes, women in the
                      UK have it better than at any point in the past; no, that
                      doesn&#8217;t mean that equality has happened.<\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <strong
                        >2.<\/strong> \u201c<b
                          >I&#8217;m just &#8216;one of the lads&#8217; in my
                          social group\/place of work. Feminists are trying to
                          drive a wedge between me and the men in my life by
                          making a fuss over nothing.\u201d<\/b><\/p>\n
                          <p>
                            It is wonderful to be accepted as socially or
                            professionally equal to men. Yet I felt bile rising
                            in my throat as I typed that. Being \u201cone of the
                            lads\u201d, while harmless on the face of it, is an
                            argument that has some rather unpleasant meanings
                            once you place it under scrutiny. It panders
                            directly to the \u201cman, rather than person, as
                            default\u201d rhetoric that pervades almost every
                            corner of our society.<\/p>\n
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            This line of reasoning erases feminine identities
                            and elevates stereotypically masculine traits or
                            interests as something one should aspire to and work
                            towards, something essential for social acceptance.
                            There is internalised misogyny afoot every time a
                            self-proclaimed \u201cladette\u201d crows about
                            chugging pints of beer, watching a match, ogling
                            boobs or besting her boyfriend at
                            <strong
                              >Modern Warfare 2<\/strong>. The heavily implied
                              sentiment here is \u201cthese are all MAN things
                              and I am more like a MAN for doing them and that
                              puts me above all of you feminists trying to spoil
                              my fun.\u201d<\/p>\n
                              <p>
                                None of these activities are inherently
                                \u201cgendered\u201d, and the fact you behave
                                like they are is sort-of-kind-of-rather
                                undermining those of us genuinely striving for
                                equality.<\/p>\n

                                    Feminism is trying to give women a leg-up
                                    over men and that is
                                    unfair!\u201d<\/b><\/p>\n
                                    <p>
                                      Yes, the promotion of one group of people
                                      over another based on nothing but their
                                      attributes at birth is inherently unfair,
                                      and no, this is not what the majority of
                                      feminists want.<\/p>\n
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                      Feminists LIKE men. In fact, plenty of
                                      feminists ARE men. Feminism is about
                                      reaching equality, or parity, whatever you
                                      want to call it. It is a movement against
                                      the oppression of hundreds of years. In
                                      most fields of employment, and certainly
                                      at the highest levels, women are
                                      underrepresented. If you really believe
                                      that we already exist in a meritocracy,
                                      how else could you account for this
                                      disparity without the spurious notion that
                                      \u201cmen are just better at everything,
                                      LOL\u201d?<\/p>\n
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                      Feminists are not seeking to take anything
                                      away from men: they are simply trying to
                                      level the still-slanted playing field so
                                      that the ball stops rolling into the
                                      men&#8217;s goal by default. Sure,
                                      it&#8217;s not the vertiginous cliff face
                                      it once was, but the angle of elevation
                                      still very much favours the dudes. If you
                                      want a meritocracy, you have to submit to
                                      its conditions. If you believe the only
                                      way you can succeed is by ensuring that
                                      the oppressive status quo is maintained,
                                      then you may need to revisit your
                                      understanding of the term \u201cindividual
                                      merit.<\/p>\n
                                    </p>
                                    <p>***<\/p>\n</p>
                                    <p>
                                      These are just three of the more common
                                      arguments I hear. From women with whom I
                                      am friends, it&#8217;s troubling, but can
                                      at least be the start of a constructive
                                      dialogue. From women in the public eye,
                                      however, from politician to pop star,
                                      these are toxic messages that reinforce
                                      oppression and can thwart the ambitions of
                                      girls and women.<\/p>\n
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                      The cognitive shift from \u201cHey, I can
                                      do that, and I happen to be a girl!\u201d
                                      to \u201cI would like to do that, but
                                      I&#8217;m a girl\u201d may sound subtle,
                                      but its impact is potentially devastating.
                                      The dismissive words of a high-achieving
                                      female role model can make all the
                                      difference, so it&#8217;s vital that we
                                      understand that these women would not be
                                      where they are today without feminism and
                                      that their public declarations show a
                                      fundamental lack of understanding about
                                      the ongoing struggle for equality.<\/p>\n
