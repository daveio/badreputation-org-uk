      sucked up in it a bit too &#8211; it came after I&#8217;d spent hours
      reading and listening to accounts of female gamers being threatened with
      rape just because they dared to play socially.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      A day later, Crystal Dynamics <a title=\"Digital Spy: Tomb Raider
      Attempted Rape Comment Retracted\"
      href=\"http:\/\/www.digitalspy.co.uk\/gaming\/news\/a387186\/tomb-raider-attempted-rape-comments-retracted-by-crystal-dynamics.html\"
      target=\"_blank\">retracted the &#8220;attempted rape&#8221; comment<\/a>
      and said it had been misunderstood. \u00a0Largely, I am inclined to agree,
      but not with the use of &#8216;attempted rape&#8217;; that bit
      wasn&#8217;t misunderstood. \u00a0Having seen the footage, that&#8217;s
      exactly what it is, although it is nowhere near as gruesome as much of the
      internet&#8217;s collective imagination has fathomed it to be.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene in question is part of their E3 trailer <a title=\"YouTube: Tomb
      Raider &quot;Crossroads&quot; UK trailer\"
      href=\"http:\/\/youtu.be\/2pLzSSv1Qfg\"
      target=\"_blank\">&#8220;Crossroads&#8221;<\/a> (you need to be signed in
      to YouTube to view it as it has a content warning on it). \u00a0Naturally,
      I will say that it will be <span style=\"text-decoration:
      underline;\"><strong
        >triggering<\/strong> <\/span>for some &#8211;
        <strong
          >as could the paragraph after next (&amp; other parts of the rest of
          this post) when I briefly describe what happens<\/strong> &#8211; the
          specific scene occurs at 2:15 on the vid.<\/p>\n
          <p>
            This
            <strong
              >Tomb Raider<\/strong> is going to be set before\u00a0the others,
              and is aiming to develop Lara&#8217;s character into the strong,
              kickass woman she is in those core, original games. \u00a0She is
              stranded on an island with her crew but there&#8217;s also an
              all-male gang who have been stranded on said island for much
              longer and have turned extremely savage. \u00a0They kill
              Lara&#8217;s friends as she watches\/hears without being able to
              help them. \u00a0She tries to sneak away, but is found.<\/p>\n
              <p>
                The guy who finds her runs his hand down her body; she knees him
                in the groin and tries to run; he grabs her and tries kissing
                her neck; she bites his ear and possibly rips some of it off;
                runs, gets her hands free, gets his gun; they wrestle over the
                gun&#8230; she shoots him in the face.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                Doubtless the full scene in the game will be much longer than
                what we&#8217;ve seen here, but it is, at least, nothing so
                crass as hammering the X button on the controller to push him
                out from between her legs. \u00a0All clothes remain on, which
                doesn&#8217;t make it any less atrocious of course &#8211; but
                it could be much more graphic for the player.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                I think where Crystal Dynamics have been misunderstood is with
                their intention, and perhaps they&#8217;ve misunderstood their
                audience when talking about this assault.<\/p>\n

                <p>
                  Discussing why it&#8217;s difficult to develop a female lead,
                  Rosenberg said: &#8220;When people play Lara, they don&#8217;t
                  really project themselves into the character&#8230;
                  They&#8217;re more like. &#8216;I want to protect her&#8217;.
                  There&#8217;s this sort of dynamic of, &#8216;I&#8217;m going
                  to this adventure with her and trying to protect her&#8217;.
                  \u00a0She&#8217;s definitely the hero but &#8211; you&#8217;re
                  kind of like her helper. When you see her have to face these
                  challenges, you start to root for her in a way that you might
                  not root for a male character.&#8221;<\/p>\n

                <p>
                  What I find most concerning\/irksome\/interesting is this idea
                  that the player wants to protect Lara as opposed to
                  <em
                    >be<\/em> her. Having watched that trailer,
                    <em

                      her, I want to jump into her skin and kick the daylights
                      out of that guy. \u00a0Perhaps that&#8217;s just me.
                      \u00a0What I think was ill-advised of Mr Rosenburg (the
                      exec producer) was his move to discuss this
                      damsel-in-distress notion at the same time as discussing
                      the attempted rape. \u00a0It kinda oozes the idea that
                      <strong
                        >Lara is just an object for men<\/strong>:<em>
                          to abuse or to protect.<\/em><\/p>\n
                          <p>
                            I suspect above all that Crystal Dynamics probably
                            need to educate themselves on better phraseology and
                            improve the content of their press interactions.
                            \u00a0They don&#8217;t seem to mean that the assault
                            and the assault alone turn her into the Lara
                            we&#8217;re all familiar with: it&#8217;s the
                            <em
                              >whole<\/em> ordeal on this island.
                              \u00a0I&#8217;m sure shooting a guy in the face
                              not 5 inches from your own is going to be life
                              changing, and on the flipside, for once a studio
                              is at least trying to show the psychological
                              effect of killing (as opposed to all the other
                              games where you&#8217;re expected to believe the
                              protag is completely unfazed by murder, despite
                              being an office worker or somesuch
                              beforehand).<\/p>\n
                              <p>
                                <em
                                  >But what about the inclusion of the attempted
                                  rape in the first place?<\/em><\/p>\n
                                  <p>
                                    Good point. \u00a0After the initial furore,
                                    I wondered whether it could be a useful
                                    educational tool: to show the audience that
                                    rape is horrific, abhorrent and should never
                                    be permitted. \u00a0Depressingly, this is a
                                    message that doesn&#8217;t seem to have sunk
                                    in with some people in society.<\/p>\n
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                    Then I saw an interesting theory in a
                                    comment thread, in which one chap theorised
                                    that we could see this attempted rape
                                    symbolically. \u00a0Perhaps this potential
                                    rapist represents all the slavering,
                                    masturbatory porn-ifying by<em>
                                      (mostly)<\/em> male gamers of Lara in
                                      previous games; her escape could represent
                                      the escape from this pin-up mentality the
                                      franchise has been plagued with. \u00a0I
                                      thought that was an
                                      intriguing\u00a0hypothesis at the very
                                      least.<\/p>\n
                                      <p>
                                        I think their move to include this
                                        assault is bold and their intention
                                        &#8211; presumably to explore the
                                        psychological transformation of such a
                                        famous female lead &#8211; is sorely
                                        needed, because we don&#8217;t have many
                                        fully developed standalone female
                                        characters (i.e. that aren&#8217;t just
                                        an option opposite a male version).
                                        \u00a0Above all, however, they probably
                                        need to be able to express themselves in
                                        a much clearer fashion and, preferably,
                                        drop this
                                        <em
                                          >&#8216;the player just wants to
                                          protect her&#8217;<\/em>
                                          nonsense.<\/p>\n
                                          <p>
                                            If, when it is released, we discover
                                            this attempted rape has just been
                                            used to crush her identity as a
                                            strong, independent female
                                            character, to put her back in her
                                            place as a subjugated product of
                                            patriarchal desires, then I will
                                            stand corrected. \u00a0For now, I
                                            think we should step back and see
                                            where this goes.<\/p>\n
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                            Overall, however, I fear Lara will
                                            never be free of the patriarchy that
                                            created her &#8211; in both her
                                            story and her creation as a game
                                            character. At least they seem to
                                            have designed her wearing a bra this
                                            time around.<\/p>\n
