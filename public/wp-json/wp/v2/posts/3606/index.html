        I asked some leading UK pro-choice campaigners whether the US
        reproductive justice approach introduced in Part 1 is relevant to their
        work, and what &#8211; if anything &#8211; might be gained from creating
        a similar movement in Britain.<\/p>\n

            Black British women are, according to Department of Health
            statistics, more likely to have an abortion than their white
            counterparts (<a title=\"Department of Health statistics\"

            On the other side of the Atlantic there has been some especially
            poisonous anti-choice campaigning based around a similar difference.
            Georgia Right to Life posted 80 billboards around the city of
            Atlanta proclaiming \u201cBlack people are an endangered
            species\u201d, with a website address: toomanyaborted.com. Loretta
            Ross, National Co-ordinator of <a
            href=\"http:\/\/www.sistersong.net\/\">SisterSong<\/a>, described it
            as:<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            \n
            <p>
              a misogynistic attack to shame-and-blame black women who choose
              abortion, alleging that we endanger the future of our
              children\u2026 Our opponents used a social responsibility frame to
              claim that black women have a racial obligation to have more
              babies \u2013 especially black male babies &#8212; despite our

              Alarmingly, the UK anti-choice movement has already begun to adopt
              some of the US campaigning messages about the &#8216;black
              genocide&#8217;. Lisa Hallgarten, Director of

                International clinic in Brixton is routinely picketed by antis
                who claim that MSI is trying to kill black babies. I have seen
                leaflets that claim that Brook is a eugenic organisation.\u201d
                This is just the latest trend in a pattern of UK anti-choicers

                            rights approach has not, in my opinion, been quite
                            so vital or so relevant to our

                              Lisa agreed that a rights-based approach
                              hasn\u2019t been widely adopted: \u201cSince UK
                              policy can be made or broken by the Daily Mail it
                              is hard to take an abstract political or human
                              rights approach to these things\u201d. But she was
                              clear on some of the problems with the existing
                              situation, including the emphasis on abortion as a
                              medical issue:<\/p>\n
                            </p>

                                The public health approach is fundamentally
                                limited and limiting because it relies on
                                scientific evidence supporting the role of
                                abortion in public health. For me there is a
                                point where personal autonomy may trump public
                                health and we should always keep our commitment
                                to autonomy at the forefront of

                                  Lack of sex education is a clear obstacle not

                                  in time, but to society getting better at
                                  talking about sex. I think, realistically,

                                          in the UK in a wider context of social

                                            protect doctors. I think there is a
                                            big danger of losing their support
