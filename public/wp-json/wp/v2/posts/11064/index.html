  <p>
    When I think about everything about womanhood that hamstrung me with fear
    when I was thirteen it all came down, really, to princesses. I didn\u2019t
    think I had to work hard to be a woman (which is scary but obviously
    eventually achievable). I thought I had to somehow magically &#8211; through
    superhuman psychic effort &#8211; transform into a princess instead.
    That\u2019s how I\u2019d get fallen in love with. That\u2019s how I\u2019d
    get along. That\u2019s how the world would welcome me.<\/p>\n

        Welcome to part two of Kickass Princesses \u2013 a look at some
        subversive female protagonists in children&#8217;s literature. <a

        The more children&#8217;s books I read and the more princesses I come to
        know, the more I realise that &#8216;kickass&#8217; probably
        wasn&#8217;t the best term to use. Some of these characters do kick ass,
        but the main feature is turning out to be simply that they make
        unconventional princesses.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        As the archetype of a fairytale princess is so ingrained, it takes
        looking at a wide variety of &#8216;unprincessy&#8217; examples to
        unpick exactly what some of our starting assumptions are. A closer look
        at the &#8216;unconventional&#8217; princesses here, and in my previous
        post, reveals that these women and girls have agency, interests, and are
        more than just a beautiful, delicate, unsullied physical appearance.
        Sometimes they aren&#8217;t even beautiful at all. What they are \u2013
        what, we realise, makes them &#8216;unprincessy&#8217; \u2013 is often
        simply the fact that they are two-dimensional characters.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        Ouch. This stereotype needs subverting roughly forever ago. On with the
        show&#8230;<\/p>\n

                At 107 pages, this one&#8217;s aimed at a slightly older age
                group than the rest of the books in this post, which are all
                picture books.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                The plot begins when the seventh princess is born in the land of
                Phantasmorania, and even the fairies are invited to the
                Christening, despite the King&#8217;s reservations. The
                bad-tempered and seaweedy fairy Crustacea, pissed off by the bad
                journey in to the palace, gives the baby the gift of
                ordinariness. Instantly the baby cries for the first time, and
                becomes considerably less attractive. As she grows up, our girl
                Amethyst (known as Amy) doesn&#8217;t look great in fine gowns
                like her blonde, willowy, ethereal and frankly boring and
                unknowable sisters. Instead, she loves climbing down the
                wisteria which grows up the castle walls and sneaking out to the
                forest.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                Thanks to her extremely ordinary looks, Amy turns out to be
                impossible to marry off. Oh, the shame of it all! Not that our
                girl is bothered, but the rest of the kingdom is. When she
                learns of a harebrained scheme to get her rescued from a dragon
                so a prince will be obliged to marry her, she runs away to the
                forest, where she lives happily until her clothes start falling
                apart. So, in need of money to buy a new dress, she goes and
                gets a job in another palace, living in disguise as an ordinary
                girl. Where she meets a prince \u2013 but I&#8217;ll leave some
                plot to those who want to read it.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                The style of writing makes for a truly luscious fairytale, and
                the black and white line-drawn illustrations by the author are
                very pretty too (just the right side of twee). Plot-wise, this
                book is strongest in its treatment of Amy&#8217;s interaction
                with Crustacea, her Godmother, who is practical, warm-yet-tough,
                and advises her to get on with it.<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                It&#8217;s weakest \u2013 in my humble socialist opinion \u2013
                when our girl loves every minute of working insane hours on the
                lowest rungs of the servant-ladder. C&#8217;mon, girlie,
                you&#8217;ve worked out it&#8217;ll take you roughly a year to
                earn enough to buy a new dress. Aren&#8217;t you a bit annoyed
                at the sucky pay? Also: the insinuation throughout the book that
                freckles and an upturned nose make someone undateable got on my
                nerves quite a bit. Freckles can be well hot, and don&#8217;t
                get me started on pixie faces&#8230;<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                (Interestingly, each book I&#8217;ve looked at for these posts
                has often pushed an idea of what a typical beautiful princess
                looks like, but none of them quite match.)<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                I was a little disappointed in how conventionally the ends got
                tied up, but I suppose how the plot came to be is more important
                than what came to be. Our girl has agency, there&#8217;s no
                doubt about it. And there&#8217;s nothing wrong with a happy
                ending.<\/p>\n
