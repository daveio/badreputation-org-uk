        Alright then,
        <strong
          ><a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0390022\/\">Friday Night
          Lights<\/a><\/strong> (the film, not the TV series). It&#8217;s the
          true-ish (true in as much as any Hollywood adaptation of real events
          is ever true) story of the 1988 Permian Panthers, a highschool
          American football team based out of Odessa, Texas. Based on the book
          of the same name by
          <strong
            >H.G. Bassinger<\/strong>, it&#8217;s really quite an amazing
            depiction of the levels of pressure placed on young players in a
            town that has nothing else going for it. Odessa is the sort of town
            where you get into college with a football scholarship, or you stay
            there and live out the same life your parents did.<\/p>\n
            <p>
              It might be a somewhat unusual choice for this site, given that
              it&#8217;s focused entirely on the macho-tastic world of American
              football, and features less than a handful of female characters
              &#8211; all defined by their relationship to one of the males (the
              coach&#8217;s wife, the quarterback&#8217;s mother) &#8211; who
              get maybe 10 lines in total. But stick with me here, because the
              film does raise a few issues worth discussing.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              First up, let&#8217;s just cover why this film counts as a
              favourite. American football, more than perhaps any other sport,
              is self-mythologising. It builds up a grand narrative, spins out
              legends, and casts itself as something more than just a bunch of
              millionaires in armour running into each other. Go watch a
              highlight <a
              href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=iVuA79cyM8Y\">video<\/a>,
              or an episode of <a
              href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=vc2QGdrecTo\">America&#8217;s
              Game<\/a>, which shows the story of each year&#8217;s Superbowl
              winner. Everything about them, the way the footage is cut, the
              music, is all part of narrativising the events, making myths. And
              Friday Night Lights captures that perfectly.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              Part of the reason the film captures that feeling so well, and
              part of what makes it a good film (other than some excellent
              cinematography and casting) is the soundtrack. The film is almost
              entirely accompanied by the work of Explosions in the Sky, a
              sweeping instrumental act native to Texas, where the events take
              place. Take a listen to <a
              href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=YI1Tv5mty6U\">this<\/a>
              and tell me it doesn&#8217;t make you want to go do something
              grand.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              But enough of the fanboying. Let&#8217;s look at the issues this
              film brings up.<\/p>\n

            <p>
              The first interesting thing the film handles is issues of race.
              Texas, particularly the smaller towns, is not well known for its
              progressive attitude towards racial equality. So when the
              championship game turns out to be against the state&#8217;s first
              all-black team, Dallas Carter, this is a big thing. And you know
              what? It&#8217;s handled pretty damn well. It can probably best be
              summed up with one particular quote. The coaches and assorted
              hangers-on of both teams have met to discuss where the game will
              take place, and how it will be adjudicated to ensure fairness.
              Asked about referees, the Panthers&#8217; coach suggests hiring a
              team of officials. Asked whether these zebras<sup
                ><a href=\"#footnote_0_5890\" id=\"identifier_0_5890\"
                class=\"footnote-link footnote-identifier-link\" title=\"Zebras
                being a nickname for referees, due to their black and white
                striped tops. \">1<\/a><\/sup> will be black or white the coach
                replies &#8220;I believe a zebra&#8217;s got about the same
                amount of black stripes as he does white ones.&#8221;<\/p>\n
                <p>
                  It&#8217;s not just the coaches. The players on the Panthers
                  are a pretty varied mix of black, white and Latino. It&#8217;s
                  hard to say how much of this is credit to the film makers, and
                  how much is merely a reflection on the make up of the real
                  life team the events are based on. What is definitely to their
                  credit though is the way these characters are handled. The
                  film makers resist the temptation to give us Male White Lead
                  #27b and make the entire film about the quarterback. Instead
                  we get equal screen time devoted to several of the characters
                  (with the arguable show-stealer being <a
                  href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/name\/nm1035682\/\"><strong
                    >Derek Luke<\/strong><\/a> as star running back James
                    &#8220;Boobie&#8221; Miles). It&#8217;s nice to see.<\/p>\n
                    <p>
                      The second issue we get in the film, which I&#8217;d argue
                      is relevant to basically everyone, is the pressure placed
                      on young people and the struggles of forming an identity.
                      In the context of the film this identity is mostly about
                      defining yourself as a person beyond what your town
                      expects of you as a player. But the basic principle
                      applies to any youthful deviation from accepted norms,
                      which is probably something a fair few readers here have
                      experienced. Telling the world you identify as a feminist
                      might not immediately seem the same as telling your dad
                      you don&#8217;t care that much about football, but I think
                      the film does a nice job of showing the universal
                      pressures of youth that tie both experiences
                      together.<\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Being the champions is basically all the town cares about.
                      On game day, everything shuts down as people leave their
                      workplaces to go watch the game. It&#8217;s made clear to
                      the coach that if they don&#8217;t win the state
                      championship he should probably think about finding a
                      different down to live in. Win and you&#8217;re a local
                      god, lose and you&#8217;re a pariah. The alcoholic
                      former-champion father of one character captures this
                      particularly well, kind and caring when the team&#8217;s
                      winning, drunk and abusive when his son makes a mistake.
                      How does someone grow and learn to be themselves faced
                      with that?<\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      It&#8217;s a good film, it raises some interesting points,
                      and it gives a fascinating look into the life of small
                      town Texas. And for all that it shows the darker side of
                      football, it&#8217;s still the film that made me go out
                      and start playing, so it has to get some credit for
                      that.<\/p>\n<ol class=\"footnotes\"><li

                                            It might be a somewhat unusual
                                            choice for this site, given that
                                            it&#8217;s focused entirely on the
                                            macho-tastic world of American
                                            football, and features less than a
                                            handful of female characters. But
                                            stick with me here, because the film
                                            does raise a few issues worth
                                            discussing, especially around
                                            masculinity, race, and
