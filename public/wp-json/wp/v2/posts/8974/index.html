  There are approximately 84,000 new shows debuting on television each week, or
  maybe it just feels like that. The vast majority are complete rubbish. That
  makes wading through the back catalogues of shows throughout the decades,
  looking for an awesome show with a strong female lead,\u00a0a tedious and
  depressing exercise. Here\u2019s a cheat-sheet with a few recs in no
  particular order to help with present-buying for the feminist in your
  life.<\/p>\n

        endlessly copied since. Yes, her love life crowds into her slaying, but
        Buffy has always been a slayer first and foremost. The supporting
        characters are also pretty awesome, with strong female characters
        abounding.
        <strong
          >Buffy<\/strong> may have its weaknesses, but you can\u2019t afford
          NOT to have watched it.<\/p>\n
          <h3>
            2. Xena: Warrior Princess<\/h3>\n
            <p>
              Speaking of paradigm-busting, Xena is a warrior, backed up by a
              bard\/fighter\/peacenik\/yogi. Plus, the show featured one of the
              first canonical lesbian relationships on TV. Xena kicks arse, and
              Gabrielle writes about it. I love this show for many, many
              reasons. It runs the gamut from silly and hilarious to quite
              simply heart-breaking. It\u2019s fun, and sexy, and strangely
              heart-warming at times, and whether you like the LARP swords or
              not, you can\u2019t afford to ignore this one either.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <h3>
              3. Grey\u2019s Anatomy<\/h3>\n
              <p>
                Caveat: I\u2019ve only watched up to Season 5 of this show, as I
                understand that it looses its way quite badly later on. But the
                first three seasons, especially, are exemplars of career women
                trying to make it in a very masculine profession. The friendship
                between Cristina and Meredith is for me one of the highlights of
                the show.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_8994\" style=\"width:

                    Francie, and Emily. You may have gathered that this show is
                    all about women. Sure, Jack and Arvin and Michael all get
                    their turn in the limelight, but the most dangerous
                    characters on this show are the women. They are what make
                    the world turn and tremble.<\/p>\n

                      <p>
                        This is noir in high school.
                        <strong
                          >Veronica Mars<\/strong> is one of my favourite
                          \u2018cop\u2019 shows, and Veronica isn\u2019t even a
                          cop. She\u2019s a pretty normal 17 year old girl\u2026
                          if by \u2018normal\u2019 we mean someone who in the
                          last year has had her best friend murdered, her mother
                          walk out, her father lose his job, her boyfriend leave
                          her, oh and wake up after a party not remembering
                          anything with her underwear missing. Yeah, Veronica is
                          having a swell year. She joins her dad in his P.I.
                          firm, and investigates cases in and around her school,
                          all the while trying to find out who murdered her best
                          friend. The second season story arc is a bit ropey,
                          and the third season is pretty bad, but the first
                          season (with a self-contained story arc) is some of
                          the best TV out there. Don\u2019t miss this.<\/p>\n

                                Speaking of detective shows\u2026 hands down the
                                best one out there. Is it any wonder, with Helen
                                Mirren acting her socks off? DCI Jane Tennison
                                is abrasive, smart, and an alcoholic. She\u2019s
                                investigating a series of serial killers, while
                                dealing with sexism and hostility from her
                                colleagues. I love this, but I can\u2019t watch
                                it too often; it\u2019s too upsetting.<\/p>\n

                                    successful female attorney, and it\u2019s
