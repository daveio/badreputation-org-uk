  \/><\/a>Super Girls in Sweaters<\/h2>\n
  <p>
    Have you ever looked at superheroines today and thought &#8220;Hmmm&#8230;
    they could be a bit more comfy.&#8221; All that spandex and those costumes
    with holes cut out, don&#8217;t they ever get cold? Don&#8217;t they ever
    just want to put their slippers on and relax?<\/p>\n
  </p>
  <p>
    Well, artist <a
    href=\"http:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/OniYon?ref=seller_info\"><strong
      >Hanie Mohd<\/strong><\/a> must have thought the same thing, because
      she&#8217;s got a whole series of prints on Etsy featuring super girls in
      sweaters, and they&#8217;re super cute, too! She&#8217;s got Power Girl,
      Catwoman, Oracle, Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, Rogue from the X-Men and
      Stephanie Brown&#8217;s Batgirl. I wonder who she&#8217;ll draw
      next?<\/p>\n
