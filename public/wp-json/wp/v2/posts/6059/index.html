          We have marched, struck, rioted, occupied, petitioned, organised and
          agitated not only on behalf of our own interests as women, but also as
          part of broader social movements and collective actions, both peaceful

          <p>
            Often women&#8217;s involvement in protest has drawn on their
            gendered role within families and communities. Women played a
            significant part, for instance, in the <a
            href=\"http:\/\/www.enotes.com\/food-encyclopedia\/food-riots\">riots
            over food supply, quality and price<\/a> which swept Europe during
            its transition to a capitalist market economy from the 16th century
            to the 19th. Historians like <a
            href=\"http:\/\/libcom.org\/tags\/temma-kaplan\">Temma Kaplan<\/a>,
            <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/E._P._Thompson\">E P
            Thompson<\/a> and <a
            href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Natalie_Zemon_Davis\">Natalie
            Zemon Davis<\/a> (and, er, me) have seen female participation in
            these protests as an extension of their role in the sexual division
            of labour, including food procurement and preparation, which lent
            legitimacy and authority to their involvement. The prominence of
            women in local networks of communication, and their presence in
            social centres like market squares as part of their daily routine,
            also allowed them to collectively mobilise and organise &#8211; the
            equivalent, under agrarian capitalism, of creating a Facebook Events
            page. <\/p>\n

            participation in protest, is still pretty cool.<\/p>\n

          <p>
            Just as their presence is still being obscured in reports of current
            events in the Middle East, so women have historically been absent
            from many popular and academic accounts of protest. The advent of
            feminist-influenced social history from the mid-20th century sought
            to correct masculine bias within traditional narratives of labour
            history or liberal teleologies, both of which had marginalised or
            misrepresented the involvement of women. Conversely, strictly purist
            or doctrinaire feminist narratives of history have also tended to
            ignore popular movements which did not advance a specifically
            feminist programme, regardless of how heavily women may have been
            involved. Both of these approaches resulted in the omission, until
            recently, of women from the histories of protest movements like <a
            href=\"http:\/\/www.ohio.edu\/chastain\/rz\/womchart.htm\">Chartism
            <\/a>in which they played a significant part.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            The place and properness of women in protest has long been a bone of
            contention, with discourse surrounding their involvement portraying
            them as hysterical, unwomanly, deviant, or deranged. Sheila
            Rowbotham, in her historical <a
            href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/Women-Resistance-Revolution-History-Modern\/dp\/0394719549\/ref=sr_1_8?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1303679377&amp;sr=1-8\">study
            <\/a>of women and protest, notes that: <\/p>\n
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              It is at the point where the revolution starts to move women out
              of their passivity into the conscious and active role of militants
              that the mockery, the caricatures, the laughter with strong sexual
              undertones begin. <\/p><\/blockquote>\n

              The vicious alarmism and mockery drawn by female involvement in
              politics, with which suffragists and civil rights agitators found
              themselves contending, is already evident in several cartoons on
              female <a
              href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jacobin_(politics)\">Jacobins<\/a>
              and campaigners for constitutional reform. Political cartoons of
              the 18th and 19th century were rarely noted for their subtlety,
              and caricaturists tended to focus upon the disorderly nature of
              political females, as well as imputing to them an
              &#8216;unwomanly&#8217; loose or aggressive sexuality. Cruikshanks
              depicted <a

              protagonists suggestively brandished rolled-up papers, poles
              clutched between their knees, and &#8211; oh yes &#8211; hands
              clasped in their laps to form a gaping dark hole, setting out
              their desire to usurp male power as well as their own wantonness.
              As, perhaps, does the presence of all those upthrust pikes, swords
              and cannons in <a

              identification of protestors has historically generated conflict
              and tension with identities based on race, class, sexuality, and
              ideology. To take just one example, the involvement of women in

              Nor can it be assumed that female involvement in social protest
              will naturally result in an outcome which is cognisant of,
              sympathetic to, or even comfortable for women. After the
              Women&#8217;s March to Versailles, women as revolutionaries became
              a potent symbol of the power of the French Revolution, and the
              young Republic was eventually personified in the figure of <a

              But, as <a

              Landes<\/a> has argued, Marianne&#8217;s visual prominence did not
              mean that women obtained significant political, social, or
              economic advantages during the French Revolution; the new
              Republic&#8217;s politics was one of laws and texts in which
              Marianne&#8217;s image bore no concrete significance. Similar
              tensions are apparent in the complex relationship of Iranian women
              with the <a

              of the 1979 revolution, and the contention that the presence of
              women in the current &#8216;Arab spring&#8217; uprisings, when
              acknowledged at all, is being <a

              In addition to the examples given in links above, this series will
              look in greater detail at case-studies of women&#8217;s
              involvement in social, political, and economic protest, their
              motivations and methods, their successes and setbacks. It&#8217;s
              been a long, hot summer of discontent and it shouldn&#8217;t be
              any surprise to see women as well as men taking their place in the
              sun.<\/p>\n
