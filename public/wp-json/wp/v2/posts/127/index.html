        The above is a particularly trenchant quote that it is increasingly
        important to bear in mind, when using online services.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        With any luck, most people reading this will already have read <a
        href=\"http:\/\/geekfeminism.org\/2010\/05\/08\/facebook-is-a-feminist-issue\/\">Facebook
        is a feminist issue<\/a>, and a lot of what&#8217;s being talking about
        here will be redundant. In case you haven&#8217;t, though, and in case
        your clicking finger is suffering from temporary paralysis, the broad
        point it is making is that on-line privacy is a very, very real concern
        for feminists, since it affects any number of vulnerable classes of
        people, and particuarly those who are victims of abuse, and that
        Facebook is quite staggeringly bad when it comes to online privacy
        &#8211; it&#8217;s another path by which people can abuse one another,
        and more importantly, it makes it increasingly easy for abusers to track
        down and\/or monitor the activity of their victims &#8211; even if their
        victims block their abuser from their profile, the abuser may still have
        friends in common with their victim, and therefore be able to see their
        victim&#8217;s activities where they intersect with friends via Facebook
        photo albums and similar.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        Considered in the light of the above quote, it&#8217;s very easy to see
        why this is the case. Facebook&#8217;s business model absolutely relies
        on sharing the personal information of its users with as wide an
        audience as possible, for marketing purposes &#8211; its user-base is
        the product that it sells. But what&#8217;s worse is that even if you
        yourself choose not to share certain information, that&#8217;s no
        guarantee that it will not be available.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        <a
        href=\"http:\/\/www.boston.com\/bostonglobe\/ideas\/articles\/2009\/09\/20\/project_gaydar_an_mit_experiment_raises_new_questions_about_online_privacy\/?page=full\">Project
        Gaydar<\/a> is a research project by some students at MIT, who built
        some software that analysed Facebook profiles. They found that even if a
        person&#8217;s Facebook profile did not mention their sexual
        orientation, they could predict it to 85% accuracy, simply by analysing
        the profile data of the people they are Facebook friends with.
        It&#8217;s important to stress that there&#8217;s no evidence of this
        research being used outside of the project, or with any sort of
        malicious intent &#8211; it&#8217;s simply a demonstration of the
        possibility.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        It&#8217;s worth noting that the problem presented by Project Gaydar is
        actually not Facebook&#8217;s fault. It&#8217;s simply an emergent
        property of any social network, on-line or off &#8211; one is judged by
        the company one keeps. And one cannot fault the companies that provide
        these services, and make us into the products they sell (without getting
        into anti-capitalist theory, a topic for another time and another place)
        &#8211; the companies are simply behaving as the market dictates.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        And this sort of thing in only going to get worse &#8211; companies like
        <a href=\"http:\/\/www.foursquare.com\">Foursquare<\/a>, <a
        href=\"http:\/\/www.gowalla.com\">Gowalla<\/a>, and Facebook&#8217;s new
        &#8220;Places&#8221; feature make their users real-time location
        information available to their friends, on-line. At time of writing,
        there hasn&#8217;t been a high-profile case of this sort of sensitive
        data being abused or leaked, but it&#8217;s surely only a matter of
        time.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        Even beyond the sphere of social networking, there are, of course, other
        sorts of privacy concerns on-line, relating to anonymity &#8211; witness
        the outing in the press of <a
        href=\"http:\/\/girlwithaonetrackmind.blogspot.com\/\">Zoe Margolis<\/a>
        on the publication of her first book. The issue of privacy management
        on-line is not going to go away any time soon, and as line between the
        online and the offline increasingly blurs away into nothing it&#8217;s a
        conversation that feminists should be gearing up to be part of.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>So, what can you do?<\/p>\n</p>
      <p>
        If you&#8217;re concerned about your Facebook privacy settings, then you
        can look at <a
        href=\"http:\/\/www.reclaimprivacy.org\/\">Reclaimprivacy.org<\/a>
        &#8211; it&#8217;s a volunteer-run site that does its best to stay on
        top of the ever-shifting goalposts of Facebook privacy.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        If you&#8217;d like to do further reading on this issue surrounding
        social networks, privacy and vulnerable people, then searching the
        brilliant <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zephoria.org\/thoughts\/\">danah
        boyd&#8217;s archive<\/a> is likely to yield a lot of further reading
        &#8211; it&#8217;s not always her primary concern, but the nature of her
        research into social media means she comes up against it a lot.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        You might also like to consider volunteering with, or donating to
        organisations like the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.eff.org\">EFF<\/a> or the
        <a href=\"www.aclu.org\">ACLU<\/a> both of which regularly deal with
        privacy issues as part of their broader remit, and whose blogs are good
        sources of information on current events in this area.<\/p>\n<div
