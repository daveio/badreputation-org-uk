    >Before I get stuck into this review proper, I want you to know, readers,
    that I have found it impossible to review without spoilers.\u00a0 THERE ARE
    SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW.\u00a0 If you care about spoilers for this film,
    scroll on down past the review to the illustrations and the &#8220;you
    should\/should not see this film because&#8230;&#8221; bullet points.

      Other thing is,

        >there&#8217;s talk of rape in this, too<\/strong>.<\/p>\n
        <p>
          Now, I went to see

            >The Skin I Live In<\/strong> (<em
              >La Piel Que Habito<\/em>) on my own, which was possibly a
              mistake, the reason for which you&#8217;ll realise as you read
              on.\u00a0 I have a little snippet of anxiety left over from school
              whereby if I go to do something alone, I&#8217;ll be afraid
              I&#8217;m in the wrong place.\u00a0 I&#8217;ll get my ticket, read
              the ticket, go to the place it says on the ticket, but I&#8217;ll
              still be a bit scared that I&#8217;m somehow, magically, in the
              wrong place.<\/p>\n
              <p>
                So there I sat in the Arts Picturehouse in Cambridge, nervously
                clutching my mug of tea (THEY LET YOU BRING FUCKING TEA INTO THE
                FUCKING CINEMA OH MY GOD HEAVEN IN AN AUDITORIUM!!!!), wondering
                if, when the film started, it&#8217;d be the right one or
                not.<\/p>\n

                Ten minutes of sumptuous interiors, high-angled shots,
                hyper-saturated film and an onslaught of seething, brooding
                madness in, I realised with great satisfaction that yep,
                I&#8217;m watching a goddamned

                  favourite toys, tropes and themes, doesn&#8217;t he?\u00a0
                  This is another film that watches class through a fish-eye
                  lens, focussing on the life of a very well-off, in-demand
                  surgeon (<strong
                    >Antonio Banderas<\/strong>), who is currently undertaking
                    research into the growth of synthetic human skin for the
                    treatment of burns sufferers.\u00a0 He has
                    &#8220;help&#8221; and a housekeeper and everything.<\/p>\n
                    <p>
                      Also, he keeps a young woman (<strong
                        >Elena Anaya<\/strong>) as a pet in a locked room and
                        does experiments on her.<\/p>\n
                        <p>
                          This is just the set-up.\u00a0 This is all revealed in
                          the first extravagant slice of immaculately tailored,
                          dressed and designed film.\u00a0 It goes further.
                          Every single character in this film is broken in some
                          fundamental way.\u00a0 Or if they don&#8217;t start
                          out that way, they become that way.<\/p>\n
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The only truly sympathetic character, I found, was
                          that of the housekeeper, Marilia (<strong
                            >Marisa Paredes<\/strong>).\u00a0 She&#8217;s
                            stalwart and practical, caring and protective, and I
                            wish she survived &#8217;til the end, but she
                            doesn&#8217;t.\u00a0 I was surprised, actually, that
                            there were
                            <em

                                  horrible in some ways, and deeply sympathetic
                                  in others, leaving you with absolutely no
                                  bloody idea what to make of them
                                  overall.<\/p>\n

                                    Now, while I was watching this, absorbing it
                                    like a sponge, my thoughts drifted &#8211;

                                        this ongoing obsession (theme,

                                        as transgender characters, which is
                                        something that Hollywood has yet to
                                        realise is a thing that they should
                                        fucking do, too.\u00a0
                                        &#8220;Huh,&#8221; I thought, with this
                                        in mind, watching Antonio

                                                clusterfuck in more detail,
                                                I&#8217;m going to make a quick
                                                aside here and say that this
                                                film also deals with consent and
                                                choice, and what happens to our
                                                minds when these basic human
                                                rights are removed from
                                                us.\u00a0 There&#8217;s a lot of
                                                relatively graphic sex in it,
                                                and not all of it is 100%
                                                doubtlessly consensual, so
                                                please bear that in mind if
                                                you&#8217;re off to watch
                                                it.\u00a0 There&#8217;s also
                                                non-consensual body modification
                                                and surgery, none of which is
                                                graphic, but the treatment of it
                                                is brutal and plays upon the
                                                mind&#8217;s ability to patch in
                                                worse realities than that to
