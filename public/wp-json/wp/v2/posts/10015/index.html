      HURRAH!<\/h3>\n
      <ul>
        \n
        <li>
          I remain so, so pleased to see a Pixar movie from the point of view of
          a girl character. Without exception, the entire Pixar canon &#8211;
          which I&#8217;m a huge, boxset-toting, scene-quoting fan of, for the
          record &#8211; features male protagonists, and while <a
          href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jessie_(Toy_Story)\">Jessie<\/a>,
          <a href=\"http:\/\/pixar.wikia.com\/Dory\">Dory<\/a>, and <a
          href=\"http:\/\/pixar.wikia.com\/Ellie_Fredricksen\">Ellie<\/a> (who
          determines much of
          <strong
            >Up<\/strong>&#8216;s story even though it&#8217;s via her absence)
            are all fun and compelling sidekick or partner characters,
            I&#8217;ve been waiting for Pixar to place a female character
            centre-stage. And now, after over 20 years, we&#8217;ve got one in
            the shape of Princess Merida, headstrong Scottish medieval archery
            whizz. <\/li>\n
            <li>
              Placing a female character centre-stage, of course, is not the
              be-all and end-all. Disney&#8217;s been doing it for years with
              their fairytale movies and resultant &#8220;princess&#8221; brand.
              They&#8217;ve finally brought the curtain down on their run of
              &#8220;princess&#8221; films with 2010&#8217;s <a
              href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0398286\/\"><strong
                >Tangled<\/strong><\/a>, which I thought was charmingly smart,
                sassy and very happy, to a point, to send up its own canon. But
                it still operated very much within the constraints of that canon
                &#8211; it was, in places, a bit like
                <strong
                  >Legally Blonde<\/strong> in Fairytale Land &#8211; and
                  I&#8217;m hoping this will bust the box open juuuust a bit
                  more.<\/li>\n
                  <h3>
                    BROW-FURROW!<\/h3>\n
                    <li>
                      I think it&#8217;s interesting that Pixar have chosen, as
                      far as I can tell, to make their first girl-POV movie
                      begin from a starting problem of an arranged marriage
                      tradition, and the synopsis as it stands (it&#8217;s on
                      the io9 page) hints that they&#8217;re going with Little
                      Mermaid-style tropes of &#8220;headstrong young woman
                      consults wise woman for advice to avoid patriarchal
                      problem; things go wrong&#8221;, and so on. Being critical
                      for just a moment, I do think it would be good in the end
                      to get to a Disney\/Pixar film where female characters are
                      not lone figures in a world of predominantly male
                      characters, or on quests where the aim is to fight the
                      male status quo. Or as one commenter on io9 put it,
                      &#8220;I&#8217;m still waiting for the movie about the
                      girl who doesn&#8217;t have to prove she&#8217;s awesome
                      or that she&#8217;s as good as boys&#8221;. It makes me
                      want to cheer and bounce off my chair when Merida fires
                      that final arrow in front of all those shocked dudes, but
                      I&#8217;d also quite like to just see her &#8230; go on a
                      quest that isn&#8217;t about Defying Sexism. Lone Female
                      Crusaders are all over our screens with relative

                          like to see more scope for women in Hollywood stories
                          to get to interact a bit more with

                                Buuuut the fact remains that this scene still
                                makes me go misty eyed and wibbly at the
                                slightest provocation. I love how it looks and
                                feels, and it&#8217;s got Billy Connolly
                                (playing Princess Merida&#8217;s warlord dad,
                                with whom she seems to have a pleasingly
                                co-conspirator relationship rather than what I
                                call the King Triton Model, though this does
                                mean relations with mum aren&#8217;t looking
                                cosy), Emma Thompson, Julie Walters (the wise
                                woman conflict catalyst!) and more on board.
                                It&#8217;s been co-authored by two women (for

                                excited (IT HAS A BEAR IN IT I LOVE BEARS I HOPE
                                SHE DOES NOT SHOOT THE BEAR) that I&#8217;m

                                ENTIRELY SPECULATION, BUT ANYWAY: On the fairy
                                tale riffing front, I&#8217;m pleased to see
                                such an obvious Robin Hood folklore moment
                                referenced in the scene above &#8211; he, of
                                course, <a
                                href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_v1OaC4jv1c#t=4m59s\">splits
                                an arrow just like this<\/a> in his own quest to
                                win Maid Marion, and in this version the
                                princess is out to win&#8230;her own hand. Neat.
                                Since it was originally titled
                                <em
                                  >The Bear and the Bow<\/em>, so presumably has
                                  a bear of some importance in the story,
                                  it&#8217;s also got me wondering whether
                                  it&#8217;ll draw on beast stories like <a
                                  href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/East_of_the_Sun_and_West_of_the_Moon\">East

                                  Bear of Norway<\/a>. The idea is that the

                                  a curse along the way. That might not happen
                                  in
                                  <strong
                                    >Brave<\/strong> at all, but since the
                                    opening problem is marriage-related
                                    I&#8217;d be surprised if no options around
                                    the topic came up, and if it doesn&#8217;t
                                    happen like that, that&#8217;ll be an
                                    attempt at subversion in itself. Either way,
                                    I think with the final title being
