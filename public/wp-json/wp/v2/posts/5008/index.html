          I love live comedy, honest I do. I spent two weeks at the
          <strong
            >Edinburgh Fringe Festival<\/strong> last year and I&#8217;ll be
            there for the full three weeks this year. Some of my best friends
            are (very good) comedians. However, as a scene: live comedy has a
            problem. I haven&#8217;t been an aficionado for many years, so maybe
            it was always there &#8211; but if <a
            href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/lifeandstyle\/2010\/sep\/10\/rape-jokes-in-comedy\">recent
            articles<\/a> are anything to go by; it seems to be growing.
            Increasingly, the search for &#8216;edgy&#8217; material is
            translating into a scene where the recoil laugh &#8211; the
            <em
              >I-can&#8217;t-believe-you-just-said-that <\/em>laugh &#8211; is
              the only one aimed for. The targets are &#8216;soft&#8217; &#8211;
              minorities and marginalized groups &#8211; and the jokes prod at
              the same old prejudices. The numbers of times I come home from a
              comedy gig wanting to dry-clean my brain is rising.<\/p>\n

                enough to write this article after an especially bad gig I went
                to recently. A sketch group of white, able-bodied young men
                performed a series of female grotesques which were so
                consistently unpleasant that &#8211; though cheerily presented
                &#8211; the unmistakable undercurrent to the evening was
                &#8216;we really don&#8217;t like women much.&#8217; Most
                sketches involved a member of the group donning a plastic wig to
                &#8216;be a girl&#8217; &#8211; and every female character was a
                Lolita, a whore, a woman giving birth or a mother who hated her
                children. The punchlines ranged from coat hanger abortions to
                incest to rape to paedophilia. At my table, from about halfway
                through, we didn&#8217;t laugh so much as look to each other for
                reaction shots and a reality check. This troupe&#8217;s final
                skit was a song and dance number, the &#8216;Cell Block
                Tango&#8217; from
                <strong
                  >Chicago<\/strong>, with the <a

                  changed to &#8216;<em
                    >she<\/em> had it coming&#8217;. Had there not been other
                    people on the bill who I really wanted to see, I would have
                    walked out then and there.<\/p>\n
                    <p>
                      The problem is more widespread than just <a

                      have pointed out this <a
                      href=\"http:\/\/chris-coltrane.livejournal.com\/405924.html\">return
                      to the bad old days<\/a>. It seems like the decades of
                      hard-earned progress, a basic standard of
                      &#8216;don&#8217;t be a shit to the marginalised&#8217;,
                      is being discarded because now it&#8217;s apparently
                      ironic. Sexism is increasingly tolerated (after all,
                      everything&#8217;s sorted and equal now, so just lighten
                      up, bitch) and other kinds of prejudice are also creeping
                      back, too. &#8216;It&#8217;s not racist, it&#8217;s just
                      un-PC, and no one likes political correctness. So, while
                      we&#8217;re at it, what about those immigrants, homos, and
                      the disabled, aye?&#8217;<\/p>\n

                      Increasingly comedians who get pulled up for saying
                      genuinely unpleasant things (I&#8217;m looking at you, <a
                      href=\"http:\/\/www.chortle.co.uk\/news\/2010\/12\/09\/12343\/jordans_fury_over_frankie_boyle_gag_\"><strong
                        >Frankie Boyle<\/strong><\/a>) have taken this to be
                        their selling point and then upped the ante in general
                        douchery. While Jordan, the gossip-magazines&#8217;
                        favourite glamour model, might seem a fair target, when
                        exactly did her disabled son become fair game, too? Let
                        alone in a joke about incest and rape. I&#8217;ll repeat
                        that: an incest-rape joke about a disabled
                        eight-year-old child. <\/p>\n
                        <p>
                          While I&#8217;m sure there has always been some truly
                          unpleasant comedy around, its apparent mainstream
                          acceptance is a new trend. The Frankie Boyle joke
                          aired on Channel 4. This worries me because our words
                          do carry a power &#8211; they reflect how we see the
                          world, but they also set our standards for what is
                          normal, acceptable, okay. The trickle-down effect has
                          real-world consequences. The <a
                          href=\"http:\/\/fugitivus.wordpress.com\/2009\/06\/24\/a-woman-walks-into-a-rape-uh-bar\/\">rise
                          of the rape joke<\/a> can be a horrific trigger for
                          those who have experienced it. In increments, these
                          themes &#8211; packaged as entertainment &#8211;
                          normalise these horrors and dismiss their seriousness.
                          <\/p>\n

                          This is not an argument for censorship &#8211; I had
                          fervent arguments a few years ago with Daily
                          Fail-reading colleagues about whether
                          <strong
                            >Jerry Springer: The Opera<\/strong> should be shown
                            on TV (yes, yes, a thousand times yes!) &#8211; but
                            there is a huge middle ground between Mary
                            Whitehouse prudery and comedy which is getting
                            pretty close to hatespeech. Please, guys:
                            self-regulate a little by engaging the brain.<\/p>\n
                            <p>
                              Some would argue that if I don&#8217;t like this
                              brand of comedy, I just shouldn&#8217;t watch it.
                              To some extent they&#8217;re right, and I do try.
                              When I saw a poster in Edinburgh for a standup
                              show called &#8216;The Lying Bitch and the
                              Wardrobe&#8217; (I see what you did there) I had a
                              pretty strong inkling that this wouldn&#8217;t be
                              my kind of thing and I didn&#8217;t go. But on a
                              mixed bill (as almost all small live comedy gigs
                              are) there&#8217;s rarely any warning what each
                              person will do &#8211; so while you might have
                              gone along because you recognise one name that you
                              like, there is no disclosure until you&#8217;re
                              hearing it that the third act, Joe Bloggs, will be
                              your prejudiced asshat for the evening, berating
                              you all with a microphone for at least ten
                              minutes.<\/p>\n
                            </p>
                            <p>Oh, and you paid to see this.<\/p>\n</p>
                            <p>
                              I don&#8217;t think anything should be off-limits
                              &#8211; but some topics are so unpleasant (not to
                              mention increasingly over-mined) that if a
                              comedian wants to tackle them they will need to be
                              so damn funny, so ingenious, original, tactful
                              &#8211; that 80% of comedians just shouldn&#8217;t
                              bother. Needless to say, the 80% that aren&#8217;t
                              up to speed don&#8217;t get this, and the 20% that
                              can do it well often have better things to do than
                              prod triggertastic subjects and tired old
                              clich\u00e9s with a great big stick. They&#8217;re
                              off crafting material that makes you belly-laugh
                              (and think) rather than just titter nervously in
                              disbelief.<\/p>\n

                                  night put it: \u201cFrom a purely technical
                                  standpoint, shock humour suffers acutely from
                                  a law of diminishing returns: the audience
                                  build up a resistance to it, and that alone
                                  would be good reason to limit its
                                  use.\u201d<\/p>\n

                                    I think the thing which is missing (besides
                                    originality) is a measure of basic empathy.
                                    In the increasingly desperate search for
                                    &#8216;dark&#8217; and &#8216;cutting
                                    edge&#8217; material, comedians forget that
                                    a lot of their lazily-picked targets are
                                    people. Real people. People with feelings

                                        The rising amount of
                                        &#8216;ironic&#8217; misogyny is not
                                        creating a particularly friendly
                                        environment for a certain 50% of

                                            I wasn&#8217;t entirely sure if the
                                            person who&#8217;d invited me along
                                            had intended the evening as a date
                                            or not, so it was potentially
                                            awkward already. Then, as the
                                            evening unfolded, four out of twelve
                                            comedians used &#8216;bad
                                            fellatio&#8217; as the bedrock of
                                            their sets. One standup spent his
                                            whole set mocking his wife for not
                                            pleasuring him correctly. In the
                                            narratives that we heard that night,
                                            women&#8217;s main role was as
                                            dispensers of sexual favours &#8211;
                                            and we couldn&#8217;t even do that
                                            right. Thanks, guys. I haven&#8217;t
                                            been back to the Comedy Store

                                              For another example, I was once
                                              out with a group for a
                                              friend&#8217;s birthday when a
                                              standup did a set about making a
                                              mess in the disabled toilet and
                                              blaming it on a disabled person.
                                              While he wasn&#8217;t to know that
                                              birthday girl, sat in the front
                                              row, had cerebral palsy, why did
                                              he think this would be a good
                                              topic in the first place? How many
                                              times has he encouraged the
                                              able-bodied to laugh at this
                                              disadvantaged minority&#8217;s
