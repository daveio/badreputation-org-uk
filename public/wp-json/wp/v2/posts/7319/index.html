      \/><\/a>Women have played their part in revolution since time immemorial.
      The Trung Sisters rebelled against Han-Dynasty rule in China, 40AD;
      Boudicca led the Iceni tribe in uprising against occupying Roman forces in
      60AD; Queen Margaret of Anjou fought for the crown, successfully, at the
      battle of Tewkesbury in 1471; Lorenza Avemanay led the Ecuadorian revolt
      against the Spanish in 1803. Women have proven themselves to be worthy
      opponents on the battlefield and in the halls of power.
      <strong
        >Harriet Beecher Stowe<\/strong>, though, did none of these things: she
        wasn&#8217;t possessed of great oratory skills, or handy with a sword,
        and she didn&#8217;t lead a great army, nor overthrow an oppressor. She
        wrote a book.<\/p>\n
        <p>
          One of thirteen children, Stowe grew up in a deeply Christian family.
          Her father and seven brothers were all ministers, and when she married
          in 1836, she chose as her husband a scholar and theologian who was
          much respected by his peers. From the beginning of their marriage the
          Stowes were ardent critics of slavery. Their first home became a part
          of the <a
          href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Underground_Railroad\">Underground
          Railroad<\/a>, temporarily housing numerous runaway slaves on their
          journey to asylum in Canada. Stowe began to write articles addressing
          the problem of slavery and making a name for herself as an
          abolitionist who didn&#8217;t run with the pack.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          This might have been the extent of Stowe&#8217;s abolitionist
          activities had it not been for the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Is it true that they have been passing a law forbidding people to
            give meat and drink to those poor colored folks that come along? I
            heard they were talking of some such law, but I didn&#8217;t think
            any Christian legislature would pass it! <\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>&#8211; Uncle Tom&#8217;s Cabin, ch. 9<\/p><\/blockquote>\n</p>
          <p>
            The act underlined the illegality of harbouring fugitive slaves and
            ensured that anyone who did not aid in the capture of fugitive
            slaves was criminalised too. For Stowe, this was entirely at odds
            with the teachings of Christianity. The law may punish those who
            work against the slave trade, but Christian law was above that;
            \u201cLove worketh no ill to his neighbour,\u201d said the Bible,
            \u201ctherefore love is the fulfilling of the law\u201d (Romans
            13:10). Stowe&#8217;s abolitionist philosophy is one of the natural
            rights of individuals &#8211; it is the philosophy of Hobbes, of
            Locke and of the founding fathers and a philosophy written into the
            Declaration of Independence:
            <em
              >We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created
              equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain
              unalienable Rights. That among these are Life, Liberty and the
              pursuit of Happiness.<br \ />\n<\/em><\/p>\n
              <p>
                It was clear to Stowe that slavery denied huge numbers of people
                these rights. She wrote in a letter to Lord Denman in
                1853,<\/p>\n
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <p>
                  [A]s a woman, as a mother I was oppressed and broken-hearted,
                  with the sorrows and injustice I saw, because as a Christian I
                  felt the dishonor to Christianity \u2014 because as a lover of
                  my country I trembled at the coming day of wrath. It is no
                  merit in the sorrowful that they weep, or<br \ />\nto the
                  oppressed and smothering that they gasp and struggle, not to
                  me, that I must speak for the oppressed \u2014 who cannot
                  speak for themselves.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  As a woman, Stowe could not effect change by voting or being
                  elected to public office. But she could write. When Gamaliel
                  Bailey, editor of abolitionist newspaper the
                  <strong
                    >National Era<\/strong>, offered Stowe $100 to pen a special
                    antislavery piece, she already had a story in mind.
                    <strong
                      >Uncle Tom&#8217;s Cabin<\/strong> was published serially
                      in the
                      <strong
                        >National Era<\/strong> beginning in May 1851. When she
                        began writing, Stowe could not have anticipated the
                        impact it would have. <\/p>\n

                            on my own blog<\/a>; this post forms a sort of
                            companion piece. <\/p>\n

                                >Uncle Tom&#8217;s Cabin<\/strong> centres
                                around the lives of a group of slaves working on
                                an Kentucky plantation. The book opens with a
                                discussion between owners Shelby and Haley over
                                the sale of two slaves. Though Shelby&#8217;s
                                wife is not happy, the sale nevertheless goes
                                ahead.<\/p>\n
                                <p>
                                  The slaves in question are the eponymous Uncle
                                  Tom, a good man and devout Christian, and
                                  young Harry, the only surviving son of house
                                  slave Eliza. The narrative follows them as
                                  they leave Kentucky, Tom on a ship bound for
                                  Ohio, and Eliza and her son as escapees
                                  pursued by professional slave catchers.
                                  Throughout their journeys Tom and Eliza
                                  witness the cruelties and indignities of
                                  slavery: Eliza is refused help for fear of
                                  repercussions; Tom witnesses a suicide and
                                  hears of slave babies bred to be sold. When he
                                  is sold to a particularly cruel master Tom
                                  finds violence not only from owners, but among
                                  the slaves themselves, an indignity that
                                  suggests that those who are oppressed by the
                                  system lose both self-respect and any
                                  perspective of right or wrong.<\/p>\n

                                  While revealing the brutalities visited upon
                                  slaves from inhumane masters, the novel also
                                  relentlessly mocks the hypocrisies of
                                  so-called &#8216;benign&#8217; slave holders,
                                  represented by Shelby, who, though they are
                                  not violent and cruel themselves, support
                                  those slave holders who are less kindly and
                                  keep the system running. Slaves were, in
                                  <strong
                                    >Uncle Tom&#8217;s Cabin<\/strong> and in
                                    life, under constant physical and
                                    psychological assault.<\/p>\n
                                    <p>
                                      Stowe made sure, too, to implicate the
                                      world at large in the horrors of the slave
                                      trade. She directs the story to her
                                      readers, referring to &#8216;us&#8217; and
                                      things &#8216;we&#8217; think. Readers
                                      were therefore in cahoots with Stowe from
                                      the very beginning, so when she asks of
                                      her readers, &#8216;But sir, who makes the
                                      Trader?&#8217; (ch. 12) readers would be
                                      bound into guilt, and with good reason.
                                      Not just in America but elsewhere too,
                                      households profited from the exploitation
                                      of slaves; they bought sugar, they milled
                                      cotton. Stowe could not have used better
                                      means to galvanise support among white
                                      American moderates.<\/p>\n

                                      The novel was released as a two volume
                                      book in 1852. The original print run of
                                      5000 was woefully inadequate: in the first
                                      year, 300,000 copies were sold in the US,
                                      more than 1 million in the UK. Opinion was
                                      divided. According to Richard Yarborough,
                                      quoted in <a

                                      viewed the novel as &#8220;a godsend
                                      destined to mobilize white sentiment
                                      against slavery just when resistance to
                                      the southern forces was urgently
                                      needed&#8221;, while for abolitionists it
                                      was a vindication. Readers south of the
                                      Mason-Dixon Line were more likely to find
                                      the novel sensationalist and unjust
                                      &#8211; slavery was a much bigger part of
                                      their way of life.<\/p>\n

                                        support for the abolition movement grew.

                                        popular, bringing Stowe&#8217;s message
                                        to a wider audience, and transcending
                                        barriers of class and literacy.
                                        Inevitably, some Tom Shows took on a
                                        pro-slavery stance, but this does not
                                        seem to have diluted the effect of the
                                        work on the populace. The now famous
                                        author began speaking tours, even
                                        visiting the UK in her attempt to bring
                                        abolitionism to a wider and wider
                                        audience.<\/p>\n

                                          The abolitionist movement continued to
                                          grow. When Abraham Lincoln won his
                                          Presidency in 1860 it was on a
                                          platform of antislavery, so when
                                          eleven pro-slavery states seceded to
                                          form the Confederacy in 1861 war
                                          seemed suddenly inevitable. Of course,
                                          slavery was not the sole cause of the
                                          American Civil War; there was a
                                          significant difference in culture,
                                          economy and industry between Northern
                                          and Southern states and disagreements
                                          over federal rule versus state
                                          autonomy too. Despite these factors,
                                          when the fighting began it became
                                          clear: this was a battle between pro-
                                          and anti-slavery states. When Stowe
                                          visited Lincoln in 1862 he is reputed
                                          to have said to her, &#8220;So, you
                                          are the little woman who wrote the
                                          book that started this great
                                          war.&#8221;<\/p>\n

                                          Slavery was finally abolished in the
                                          United States in 1865 with the
                                          Thirteenth Amendment, which put an end
                                          to all involuntary servitude save for
                                          those convicted of a crime and freed
                                          40,000 or so slaves that had not been
                                          granted their freedom in previous
                                          state-by-state laws.<\/p>\n
