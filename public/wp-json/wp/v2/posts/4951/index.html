          <p>
            March saw the eagerly anticipated release of
            <strong
              >Dragon Age II<\/strong>; the follow-up to
              <strong
                >Dragon Age: Origins<\/strong> and
                <strong
                  >Awakening<\/strong> (along with all the extra DLC that became
                  available during the interim period).
                  <strong
                    >Dragon Age<\/strong>, for those of you unfamiliar with the
                    games, is a fantasy RPG in which you guide your character
                    through quests and the main plotline, battling all manner of
                    nasty creatures and unscrupulous types along the way. You
                    gather a team made up of mages, warriors and rogues who may
                    be human, elf or dwarf, and they help you defeat the forces
                    of evil.<\/p>\n
                    <p>
                      One of the key features of games like this is that you can
                      build your own character: you pick the gender, the hair
                      style, the facial features, the class (e.g. a mage), and
                      in some instances you can even pick the voice. I, for
                      example, have a male warrior elf with ginger hair in
                      <strong

                        <strong
                          >Dragon Age II <\/strong>my character Zakarianna Hawke
                          is a female, white-haired rogue with a facial tattoo
                          (you can see a visual of her below left). The
                          possibilities aren\u2019t quite endless, but
                          they\u2019re still fairly comprehensive.<\/p>\n

                                        Normally this doesn\u2019t bother me
                                        (pretty much all the games I have ever
                                        played have a male protagonist) but I
                                        read an unfortunate article that
                                        suggested Commander Shepard \u2013
                                        <strong
                                          >Mass Effect<\/strong>\u2019s
                                          protagonist \u2013 was a bit of a
                                          womaniser. So I wrote it off.<\/p>\n
                                          <p>
                                            I then, much later, got a little
                                            overexcited by all the sales after
                                            Christmas in which I saw
                                            <strong
                                              >Mass Effect 1<\/strong> and

                                                tenner. I asked my brother what
                                                he thought of them and ended up
                                                buying the games \u2013 turns
                                                out, you can play as a female
                                                character! Plus all the
                                                womanising depends entirely on
                                                the decisions made in-game by
                                                the person directing the
                                                character (again, my take on
                                                Commander Shepard, Drakhoa

                                                    advertising prior to its
                                                    release, made me wonder why
                                                    games that allow you to play
                                                    as male or female are only
                                                    ever marketed using the
                                                    preset male appearance. For
