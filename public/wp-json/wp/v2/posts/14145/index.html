        Representations of witches and witchcraft in literature and in popular
        culture generally are incredibly useful to us, providing a way of
        critiquing the situation of women under patriarchy that is both
        effective and accessible.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        Children\u2019s literature is particularly rife with such
        representations. From the wicked women of Grimm and Perrault and
        folkloric creations like Baba Yaga and Ceridwen, through C.S.
        Lewis\u2019 Jadis and the maleficent creations of Mary de Morgan to 20th
        century inventions like TH White\u2019s Madam Mim and the female
        students of Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry, lady sorcerers
        &#8211; both good and evil &#8211; have never been far from the pages of
        the books we have used to educate and entertain our children.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        The witches of the classic fairytales and of the stories of the
        Victorian era are usually monstrous and spiteful, using their magic in
        service of the Devil &#8211; or worse, their own self-interest. They
        taunt because they can and have few, if any, redeeming
        characteristics.<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <p>
        In recent decades the image of the image of the witch in popular culture
        has undergone a transformation, in no small part due to the witches that
        have appeared in juvenile literature. Since the 1970s, the stories our
        children have read have overwhelmingly featured good witches (though the
        frequency with which they are presented as inept deserves some
        attention). These are my favourites of the modern circle.<\/p>\n

            >The Worst Witch<\/strong><\/a> series follows the adventures of
            Mildred Hubble as she navigates the social and academic challenges
            of Miss Cackle\u2019s Academy, a draughty old castle that perches
            atop a thickly forested mountain and \u2018looks more like a prison
            than a school\u2019.<\/p>\n
            <p>
              It\u2019s an uncomfortable enough environment for a youngster to
              be in, but Mildred has an added disadvantage, being marked as an
              outsider by her unkempt appearance and her tabby cat (given to her
              when the rest of the girls receive sleek black kitties).<\/p>\n

                She was one of those people who always seem to be in trouble.
                She didn\u2019t exactly mean to break rules and annoy the
                teachers, but things just seemed to happen when Mildred was
                around.<\/p>\n

                  <p>
                    The young witch is thoroughly well-meaning and a little too
                    clever for her own good, but she\u2019s also bumbling and
                    frequently wrangling with authority figures. Despite her
                    perceived inadequacies, there\u2019s an air of serendipity
                    that follows her around; her failures and misdeeds
                    inevitably lead to a positive outcome of much greater
                    consequence than the proceeding mishap.<\/p>\n
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Perhaps this is why she is so well-loved by young readers
                    and so fondly remembered by adults. Often we can see a
                    little of ourselves in Mildred &#8211; from her practical
                    incompetence to her trailing shoe laces, she\u2019s a
                    reminder that you don\u2019t have to be perfect to be
                    wonderful.<\/p>\n
