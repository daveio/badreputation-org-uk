          <strong
            >Dead Space<\/strong><\/a> franchise, it&#8217;s a horror\/sci-fi
            universe that spans more than just games \u2013 there are also
            animated films that tell us parts of the story.\u00a0 I\u2019m just
            going to look at the games, though, which focus on our protagonist
            Isaac Clarke in our two space vessel settings: the USG Ishimura
            vessel and <a
            href=\"http:\/\/deadspace.wikia.com\/wiki\/Titan_Station\">the
            Sprawl<\/a>.\u00a0 In the first game, the Ishimura drops out of
            contact with, well, everyone &#8211; and nobody knows why.\u00a0
            Isaac and his shipmates are sent on a rescue mission as it is
            believed the Ishimura crew have just had a bit of damage to their
            communications array or somesuch.<\/p>\n
            <p>
              Not so.\u00a0 Long story cut very over-simplistically short, all
              the crew have either a) gone loopy, b) been killed, or c) turned
              into
              <em
                >necromorphs<\/em>.\u00a0 These are horrible scary alien things
                that loosely resemble what might once have been human.\u00a0
                Isaac gets separated from his crew, who promptly start dying off
                while he tries to find out what\u2019s going on and how to
                escape.\u00a0 Moving towards the end, there\u2019s three of
                Isaac\u2019s team left (himself included)\u2026 then there are
                two.\u00a0 Isaac and his female crewmate<a title=\"Dead Space

                        Kendra betrays you.\u00a0 She&#8217;s actually intending
                        to take the Marker back to civilisation for the
                        government and the Church of Unitology (who seem to
                        think the Marker will raise them up\u2026 or
                        something).\u00a0 Don\u2019t worry though; she dies.
                        It\u2019s OK, the nasty traitorous lady gets splattered
                        by a giant alien.\u00a0 So, you know, she deserved

                            should\u2019ve gotten suspicious as soon as she led

                            explaining the story properly, but what I wanted you
                            to know was that Isaac really seems to have terrible
                            luck when it comes to trusting people.\u00a0 Or,
                            more importantly: trusting

                              than an unfortunate coincidence that the two
                              people who most obviously betray him are
                              women.\u00a0 Surely this concept is a bit tired by

                                      experiencing old tropes that are merely
