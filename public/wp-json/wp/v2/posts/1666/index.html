                  <em
                    >Virgin<\/em> has a comparatively straightforward etymology:
                    it derives from the Latin
                    <em
                      >virgo <\/em>(= &#8216;maiden&#8217;), whence the
                      star-sign Virgo (apparently the sign of the shy, modest
                      and meticulous, with a dash of perfectionism and anxiety).
                      Its first sense (c.1200) is an ecclesiastical one:
                      &#8216;an\u00a0unmarried or chaste maiden or women,
                      distinguished for piety or steadfastness in religion, and
                      regarded as having a special place among the members of
                      the Christian church on account of these
                      merits.&#8217;<\/p>\n

                          There are innumerable such virgins in Christian
                          hagiography: Saint Ursula had an army of 11,000 virgin
                          handmaids who all had their heads chopped off (in a
                          bit of a pun-fail); Saint Cecilia (patron saint of
                          music) managed not only to persuade her husband to
                          forbear on their wedding night, but also to join the
                          Christian cause along with his brother, and suffer
                          death in consequence.<\/p>\n
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Saint Lucy consecrated her virginity to God, and,
                          supposedly, tore her own eyes out and gave them to her
                          husband (who had admired them) as a kind of macabre
                          substitute for the marital debt. (Lesson: never admire
                          your girlfriend&#8217;s essential organs).<\/p>\n
