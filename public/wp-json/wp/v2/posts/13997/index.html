                            >KW:<\/strong> I was literally falling asleep one
                            night when I had the idea for a secret lineage of
                            female bodyguards, quietly going about the business
                            of making the streets safer.<\/p>\n
                            <p>
                              This is the sort of story I wanted to see on
                              screen. It&#8217;s an old adage that you should
                              write the story you want to read, be the change
                              you want to see, and so on. I had been distressed
                              by the narrow representation of women &#8211; and
                              the UNDERrepresentation of interesting roles and
                              stories for women in media &#8211; for a long
                              time.<\/p>\n
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Two issues I find particularly insidious are the
                              tendency for any female protagonist driving the
                              story to be called a &#8220;Strong Female
                              Character&#8221;, where this adjective seems
                              unnecessary for a male protagonist, and the
                              tendency for &#8220;Strong Female
                              Characters&#8221; either to a) be somehow
                              supernaturally or technologically augmented, or b)
                              have a tendency to cry, even when on the
                              job.<\/p>\n
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              I wanted to see a story of a woman who kicks butt
                              and takes names as a matter of course. It&#8217;s
                              her job. She does her job, she does it well. The
                              fact that she&#8217;s female is not excused,
                              it&#8217;s not augmented, it&#8217;s not commented
                              on; it is not, in fact, the point. The point is
                              the story &#8211; there&#8217;s a crisis that
                              needs solving, there are obstacles, stakes get
                              raised, we wrestle with issues of morality, trust,
                              crime, betrayal&#8230;<\/p>\n

                                not commented on; it is not, in fact, the point.
                                The point is the

                                The other major factor that made me want to
                                tackle this project is that I come from a
                                background of what is generally referred to as
                                &#8216;Chicago Storefront Theatre&#8217;. We
                                have over 150 small theatre companies in
                                Chicago, producing shows in all kinds of spaces
                                that weren&#8217;t originally intended to hold a
                                theatre, because they have stories they want to
                                tell. It&#8217;s very much a &#8216;do it
                                yourself&#8217; mindset.<\/p>\n

                                That&#8217;s why I produced the web-series
                                myself, rather than writing a screenplay and
                                then sending it off to Hollywood, hoping it
                                would catch someone&#8217;s eye and that it
                                wouldn&#8217;t get lost in
                                &#8216;option-land&#8217;&#8230; I wanted to see
                                it happen.<\/p>\n

                                          itself to satellite stories. It would
                                          make a great CSI-style franchise. I
                                          would love to see The Scarlet Line:

                                          I&#8217;d just need to figure out how
