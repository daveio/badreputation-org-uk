<p>
  How many stars are there in the sky? If you\u2019re the fantastically named
  <strong
    >Annie Jump Cannon<\/strong> the answer is \u201cat least 230,000\u201d.
    Working at Harvard Observatory around the end of the 19th century, Cannon is
    credited with pioneering the first organised system of classifying stellar
    objects, the Harvard Classification System. Nicknamed \u201cThe Census Taker
    of the Sky\u201d, she classified almost a quarter of a million stars, more
    than anyone else has ever done &#8211; including 300 she personally
    discovered.<\/p>\n

      \/><\/a>Possessing a sharp mind, and with the good fortune of coming from
      a family that could afford quality education, Cannon had attended <a
      href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wellesley_College\">Wellesley
      College<\/a> and graduated with a degree in physics in 1884. Finding the
      limited career options of home life boring, and having little in common
      with her peers, being (paraphrasing from her autobiographical writings)
      older and better educated, Cannon returned to Wellesley in 1894. Guided by
      her former instructor, the formidably minded professor <a
      href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sarah_Frances_Whiting\">Sarah
      Frances Whiting<\/a>, Cannon took graduate courses in astronomy and <a
      href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Spectroscopy\">spectroscopy<\/a>
      (a relatively new development in imaging at the time), and discovered her
      true calling.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      After two years of graduate study, and looking to get access to
      Harvard\u2019s superior telescope facilities, Cannon was hired at the
      Harvard Observatory as part of the group that would become known as
      \u201cPickering\u2019s women\u201d. The
      <strong
        >Harvard Computers<\/strong>, to use the group\u2019s actual name, were
        a small group of women hired by <a
        href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Edward_Charles_Pickering\">Edward
        Pickering<\/a> to work through the raw data being gathered by the
        observatory (this of course being a time when a computer was still
        generally a person who calculated things, not a machine). Pickering had
        hired Cannon and her fellow computers largely because women were cheaper
        to employ than men, allowing him to hire more of them; a neccessity
        given that the rate at which data was being gathered was outstripping
        the rate at which it could be processed.<\/p>\n
        <p>
          So, what was Cannon earning, given her degree and graduate work at one
          of America\u2019s most prestigious private colleges, and the fund set
          up by the wealthy physician Anna Draper to support the
          observatory\u2019s work? Somewhere in the region of $0.25 to $0.50 an
          hour. This put her slightly above an unskilled factory worker, and
          somewhat below a clerical or secretarial worker. What would a lot of
          us do in the face of woefully poor pay despite excellent
          qualifications and a natural talent? Probably look for new work, or
          failing that become disillusioned and start putting in less effort
          than perhaps we should.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          Fortunately for modern astronomers, Annie Jump Cannon had a passion
          for her field, a drive for progress, and a rather brilliant mind for
          organising and classifying abstract data. Rather than throw up her
          arms in frustration at the poor pay and oten tedious work of examining
          stellar images she set herself to the task of examining the bright
          stars of the Southern hemisphere.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          Now for some vaguely sciencey details: at the time, there was a
          disagreement between two others working at the observatory, <a
          href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Antonia_Maury\">Antonia
          Maury<\/a> and <a
          href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Williamina_Fleming\">Williamina
          Fleming<\/a>, as to how stars should be classified. Cannon pioneered a
          third system, classifying stars based on the strength of their Balmer
          absorption lines (one of a set of series that describe the spectral
          line emissions of hydrogen atoms, the strength of a star\u2019s Balmer
          absorption lines provide a reliable indicator of the stars
          temperature). This provided a thorough and yet elegant means of
          classifying stellar objects, dividing them into letter categories
          based on temperature. When astronomers refer to our sun as a G-type
          star, that\u2019s Cannon\u2019s classification system in action.<sup
            ><a href=\"#footnote_0_2935\" id=\"identifier_0_2935\"
            class=\"footnote-link footnote-identifier-link\" title=\" For the
            curious, the stars are classified from hottest to coldest as O, B,
            A, F, G, K and M. The hotter stars tend to be more massive and less
            common than their colder cousins. The classes are further
            sub-divided into 0-9, 0 being the hottest in a class and 9 the
            coldest. Our own sun is a G2 star. \">1<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n
            <p>
              Following her groundbreaking work on stellar classifications,
              Cannon remained dedicated to the field of astronomy, eventually
              receiving a regular appointment at Harvard as the William C Bond
              Astronomer, in addition to receiving an honorary doctorate from
              Oxford (the first one given out to a female academic). Her legacy
              lives on for astronomers, both in the ongoing use of her work and
              in the <a
              href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Annie_J._Cannon_Award_in_Astronomy\">Annie
              Jump Cannon Award<\/a>, given out by the American Astronomical
              Society to pioneering female researchers in the field. Even off
              the planet, Cannon\u2019s memory lives on, one of the Moon\u2019s
              craters being named in her honour.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              So, next time you\u2019re looking up at the sky, keep in mind
              Annie Jump Cannon, who more than likely labelled most of the stars
              you can see.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              (As a final note, Cannon was not the only woman working in the
              Harvard Observatory at the time to do amazing things. <a
              href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Henrietta_Swan_Leavitt\"><strong
                >Henrietta Swan Leavitt<\/strong><\/a>&#8216;s work on Cepheid
                stars arguably provided the vital theoretical underpinnings on
                which much of <a

                recognition for her discoveries during her own lifetime.)<\/p>\n
