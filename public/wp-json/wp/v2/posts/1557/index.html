    <span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&#8216;My lady&#8217;, as her friends
    called her, sincerely desired to be a genuine lady, and was so at heart, but
    had yet to learn that money cannot buy refinement of nature, that rank does
    not always confer nobility, and that true breeding makes itself felt in
    spite of external drawbacks. <\/span><\/p>\n

                      I guess you can kind of see where it went from there,
                      since its original (now obsolete) meaning is as &#8216;the
                      female head of the household&#8217;; i.e., the one what
                      does the cooking, with the ambiguity that still runs
                      through many households where Mum&#8217;s In Charge, but
                      Dad&#8217;s Earning.\u00a0Thus, in its second meaning
                      (also Old English), it becomes &#8216;A woman who rules
                      over subjects<em

                        or &#8216;rhetorical&#8217; senses. But in extended
                        Middle English usage, it&#8217;s refined to &#8216;A
                        woman who is the object of a man&#8217;s devotion; a
                        mistress, lady-love&#8217;.<\/p>\n
