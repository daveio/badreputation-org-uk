  So when nearly half of the BadRep team took a trip to Tottenham Court Road to
  see
  <strong
    ><a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0446029\/\">Scott Pilgrim Vs. The
    World<\/a><\/strong>, I agreed to write about it. Markgraf wrote a review
    earlier, but here&#8217;s a look at both the movie and the comics.<\/p>\n
    <p>
      Yeah. Reviewing a film where a man duels a woman&#8217;s exes so that he
      can date her&#8230; for a feminist website? I must be mad.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      But it is not that Scott believes girlfriends can be won by duelling other
      guys. He&#8217;s not complicit in any medieval romance-style scenario. He
      and Ramona are
      <em
        >already<\/em> dating. It is more that these exes, this oddly-dressed
        group who DO subscribe to the idea that people can be won or lost
        romantically through fighting battles, must be dealt with before Scott
        and Ramona can get on with their lives, free of these people who keep on
        crashing through the ceiling and punching Scott in the face. Because
        that kind of thing can really ruin your first date.<\/p>\n
        <p>
          Now there were many good things about the movie, from Ramona&#8217;s
          ever-changing brightly-coloured hair (call me a fangirl, but I can see
          how Scott fell in love with her at first sight &#8211; I did!) to
          Edgar Wright&#8217;s special effects, which were gorgeous. The fight
          scenes were well done, just as overblown and tongue-in-cheek as they
          ought to have been, without looking cheap. I also loved the little
          touches, such as the cute &#8220;RIIIIINNG!&#8221; bubbletext that
          emerged occasionally from the phone in Scott&#8217;s flat, reminding
          us of the film&#8217;s comic book roots. The cast was well-chosen
          &#8211; Mary Elizabeth Winstead&#8217;s sardonic Ramona masters the
          spirit of the character spot on, especially when straight-faced and
          dealing with the fantastic, (boys shooting lasers out of their eyes,
          etc) whereas Kieran Culkin steals every scene he&#8217;s in as Wallace
          Wells. Can we have a Wallace Wells movie, please? I know Markgraf
          agrees&#8230;<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the movie suffers in two ways in comparison to the books: 1)
          Some things just don&#8217;t translate as well in a movie, and 2) the
          movie was written before Bryan Lee O&#8217;Malley finished the final
          books, and therefore there are some aspects of the plot which just
          don&#8217;t add up.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          The franchise <a
          href=\"http:\/\/www.philadelphiaweekly.com\/screen\/capsules\/Scott-Pilgrim-vs-the-World.html\">has
          been criticised<\/a> for being shallow, and it kind of is. It is a
          &#8216;scene&#8217; franchise. It presents a world where getting your
          band noticed or getting that girl to notice you is the biggest of your
          first-world problems, a world almost entirely made up of attractive,
          mostly white, thin teens and twenty-somethings. Was there
          <em
            >anyone<\/em> outside of this age range who appeared in the
            movie?<\/p>\n
            <p>
              But the franchise has good reason to seem this shallow. Bryan Lee
              O&#8217;Malley, the author of the series, told the actors certain
              things about their characters that would help them act their
              parts. The most revealing of these is the one Michael Cera chooses
              to quote in an interview:<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                <a
                href=\"http:\/\/www.teenhollywood.com\/2010\/08\/09\/scott-pilgrim-and-the-evil-ex\">The
                one that really stays in my head is that Scott, in his mind, is
                the star of his own movie. This movie is, in a way, existing in
                his own mind. This is his weird perception of the world around
                him.<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n
              </p>
              <p>
                Scott IS this shallow, this is his world
                <em
                  >as Scott Pilgrim sees it<\/em>. The movie and comics are not
                  flinching in their portrayal of Scott as&#8230; well&#8230; a
                  bit of a dick, really. Where the movie is insubstantial in its
                  scope and concerns, it is because Scott Pilgrim himself is a
                  shallow kinda guy.<\/p>\n
                  <p>
                    So I&#8217;m not going to criticise the franchise for its
                    essential lack of depth. What I will say is that this
                    shallowness seems more pronounced in the movie than in the
                    comics, and I believe this is a flaw in the medium, not in
                    the message.<\/p>\n
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It is much more painful to watch a real-live actor say
                    clueless lines such as \u201cLike, Chinese food?\u201d,
                    dismiss lesbianism,
                    <em
                      >constantly<\/em> mention Knives&#8217; race, or watch an
                      Indian bad guy perform an exaggerated Bollywood dance, on
                      screen in a room full of movie goers, than it is to read
                      the same thing in a comic, coming from tiny, black and
                      white cartoon people on the page. The comic, because it is
                      unrealistic, reminds us that this is Scott&#8217;s
                      &#8216;weird perception&#8217; of the world, whereas the
                      film, while there are unrealistic special effects, is not
                      quite as good at this.<\/p>\n
                      <p>
                        Crucially, the movie also makes cuts which interfere
                        with the story. A comic book in which there was room for
                        the four non-white characters to be developed gives way
                        to a movie where the Japanese Katayanagi twins are the
                        only two of Ramona&#8217;s exes who do not speak a
                        <em
                          >single<\/em> line. Knives&#8217; development from an
                          obsessed high-schooler to a kickass kid who&#8217;s
                          moved on feels much too rushed onscreen, if
                          she&#8217;s moved on at all.<\/p>\n
                          <p>
                            When the movie was originally written, it was given
                            a &#8216;Team Knives&#8217; ending &#8211; she was
                            the one who ended up taking Scott home. The
                            actresses were playing all their scenes in the
                            knoweldge that Knives would win Scott in the end.
                            Then when the sixth and final comic book came out
                            with a &#8216;Team Ramona&#8217; ending, just before
                            the release of the movie, <a
                            href=\"http:\/\/www.collider.com\/2010\/08\/07\/scott-pilgrim-interview-mary-elizabeth-winstead-ellen-wong-scott-pilgrim-vs-the-world-interview-the-thing-prequel-die-hard-5-alternate-ending\/\">
                            the very last scene was very quickly re-filmed to
                            make sure that Scott ended up with
                            Ramona.<\/a><\/p>\n
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            This hurts both Knives&#8217; and Ramona&#8217;s
                            portrayal in the movie. Movie Knives does not move
                            on, seemingly in love with Scott even as she tells
                            him to chase Ramona in the final scene. She supports
                            Scott during the final battle, making some really
                            heroic action heroine moves, and generally seems a
                            much better choice than the flighty Movie Ramona who
                            only stands by to watch Scott get mercilessly
                            pummeled by Gideon. Knives never reaches the place
                            she does in the books, where she has realised that
                            a) Scott is a dick who cheated on her and b) while
                            she forgives him, she&#8217;s got too much
                            self-respect to ever go out with him
                            again.<\/p>\n<div style=\"width: 211px\"

                            Ramona is also massively short-changed by the
                            rewrite. Comics Ramona&#8217;s very large part in
                            the final battle is entirely glossed over, so that
                            she is a passive observer for most of the final
                            scenes in the movie. In the comics, she AND Scott
                            defeat Gideon, together. She throws off
                            Gideon&#8217;s mind-control by her own ingenuity,
                            and she and Scott deliver the final blow to Gideon

                              balance. It&#8217;s pretty essential to
                              Ramona&#8217;s character, and it wasn&#8217;t in
                              the movie.<\/p>\n
                              <p>
                                Movie Ramona is a poor mind-controlled girl who
                                gets rescued by Scott. Comics Ramona rescues
                                herself. I&#8217;ll always love the comics more,
                                if only for that.<\/p>\n

                                  very enjoyable movie, and the premise is
                                  hardly as crappy in its gender politics as
                                  many BadReppers thought it might be, but it is
                                  sad that so much of the material from the
                                  comics was lost. It also suffers from a
                                  clumsily rewritten ending which punished some
                                  brilliant secondary characters and could
                                  probably have been avoided with better
                                  communication between Bryan Lee O&#8217;Malley
                                  and his scriptwriters. All in all, it&#8217;s
                                  an exciting, colourful movie which brought a
                                  great line of comics to life for many viewers,
                                  but the final half will leave some comics fans
                                  with a slight aftertaste of missed
                                  opportunity.<\/p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy
