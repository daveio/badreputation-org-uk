        Ah, the Joke Post comes upon us at last. T is for &#8216;t&#8217;&#8230;
        very droll. I lift a cup to that. But fie! Have we learned nothing on
        this lexical journey?\u00a0First and foremost,
        <em
          >tea <\/em>was not always pronounced as we currently say it: when it
          first appeared in English in 1601 it was\u00a0<em
            >&#8216;taaaaay<\/em>&#8216; and often written
            <em
              >tay <\/em>(like the modern French
              <em
                >th\u00e9<\/em>, a bit). It is not quite clear when and why the
                shift to &#8216;ti&#8217; happened, but, then,\u00a0few things
                are as easy to lose sight of as pronunciation (how many people
                remember that Keats was a\u00a0Cockney?)<\/p>\n<div

                          from the Dutch, who imported it from Malaysia and,
                          ultimately, China. What exactly were they importing?
