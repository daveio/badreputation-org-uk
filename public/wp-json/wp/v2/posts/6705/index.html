Diary of a Female Petrolhead: the Swimsuit Edition"},"content":{"rendered":"
<p>
  One day whilst sat at the side of the racetrack, I asked a fellow motorsport
  aficionado why there were so few women racing drivers. Actually, I\u2019d sort
  of thought that maybe the female competitors had their own events like
  women\u2019s 100m or women\u2019s football, which involved precisely the same
  conditions and effort, but with added frills on their flame-proof suits. This
  lasted until the first multi-car pile-up, and I noticed that one of the cars
  freshly turned into car-putty had a woman\u2019s name emblazoned on the
  bodywork.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_6708\" style=\"width: 310px\"

  So, if women compete in the same events as men \u2013 and why not, given that
  it is just as much about the cars as it is about the drivers \u2013 why are
  there so few women racing drivers? After all, there\u2019s an entire
  association out there <a title=\"British Women Racing Drivers Club\"
  href=\"http:\/\/www.bwrdc.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\">promoting women in
  motorsport <\/a>with handy lists of everything you\u2019ll need to buy to get
  started, and it\u2019s not like lack of body mass would be a disadvantage in
  what is essentially a test of lightness and speed. OK, at the top ends
  you\u2019re going to need some neck muscles to prevent you being spontaneously
  decapitated by your own car as you hit maximum G, but no more so than a female
  bodybuilder needs to achieve, surely. So why the lack?<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  To the internet! The wonders of googling \u201cfemale racing drivers\u201d
  yielded <a href=\"http:\/\/forums.digitalspy.co.uk\/showthread.php?t=643482\"
  target=\"_blank\">this pertinent thread<\/a> where I didn\u2019t learn much
  other than the names of four female drivers in the history of the entire
  sport. Thanks, guys, that totally answers my question.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  Anyway, I decided to do a little more research. How do you become a racing
  driver? Surely you can\u2019t just turn up outside Ferrari\u2019s headquarters
  and demand to join their team? (Why hasn\u2019t anyone tried this?)
  Silverstone\u2019s driver <a title=\"Become a Racing Driver\"
  href=\"http:\/\/www.silverstone.co.uk\/track\/driver-coaching\/become-a-racing-driver\/testimonials\/\"
  target=\"_blank\">testimonials<\/a> are unsurprisingly all by men. They do
  have one thing in common, though: they all started young. The official site
  for the Ginetta Challenge, one of the many races I\u2019d watched that day,
  has a helpful <a title=\"Ginetta: Become a Driver\"
  href=\"http:\/\/ginetta.com\/becomeDriver\" target=\"_blank\">flowchart<\/a>
  showing what it takes to get to the top of the league, as well as a price
  list. The
  <strong
    >Independent <\/strong>interviewed a <a
    href=\"http:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/student\/career-planning\/getting-job\/i-want-your-job-racing-driver-455919.html\"
    target=\"_blank\">young Porsche driver<\/a> and explained the top wage
    (\u00a360k) and the likely costs (thousands of pounds if you don\u2019t get
    sponsorship).<\/p>\n
    <p>
      So, to summarise: this is a sport where you have to start investing
      hundreds, if not thousands, of pounds into a pre-teen child, shepherding
      them along and making them practise every waking hour until, in their
      mid-teens, they get signed up to a racing team that then commandeers their
      careers until they\u2019re 35, at which point they\u2019re <a

      This is all well and good, and we can assume that no families on income
      support are ever going to produce the next Monaco GP winner. However,
      there is more to it than that. Starting that young, a child has to show a
      pretty strong preference for the sport, and the parents have to be
      supportive\/pushy enough (delete as appropriate) to pour their savings
      into karting and rallying and fire extinguishers. They have to want it
      just as much as the child.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      So there you are, eight years old, going up to mummy and daddy and saying,
      \u201cI want to be a racing driver! Will you sign my permission
      slip?\u201d And mummy and daddy look down on their precious little one and
      say, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we buy you a new dolly instead?\u201d<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Maybe that\u2019s not what happens to every little girl. Some undoubtedly
      come from racing families, and just as much effort is poured into their
      motorsport careers as would have been done for a male child. In some
      circles, with the right family emphasis, girls in motorsport can flourish.
      I\u2019m guessing that this is about the same ratio as male ballet
      dancers.<\/p>\n

                      Actually, I think it starts a lot earlier than that, but
                      the sex kitten perception is unlikely to encourage any
                      parent to finance his or her daughter&#8217;s racing

                      My point is this: it takes a pretty determined kind of
                      little girl to decide that she wants to go into motorsport
                      when the whole world is insisting that she should be
                      playing dress-up. And it takes a pretty supportive kind of
                      family to encourage her, rather than simply buy her
                      something frilly to shut her up. Maybe the tide is
                      turning. Maybe the little girl with the need to go
                      <em
                        >faster faster faster<\/em> only needs to ask. But if
                        it&#8217;s not turning fast enough, we will have an
                        entire generation of little girls with no female
                        motoring heroes to look to.<\/p>\n
                        <p>
                          And I can promise you that no one ever tried to talk
                          Jenson Button or Lewis Hamilton into playing with
