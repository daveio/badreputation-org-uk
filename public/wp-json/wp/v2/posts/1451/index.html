                  Its complexity is mainly owing to the range of disciplines
                  that have claimed it for their own; these include astrology,
                  astronomy, physical geography, mathematics, poetry, and
                  crystallography. Its immediate practical meaning is
                  geographical: &#8216;Each of the five &#8216;belts&#8217; or
                  encircling regions, differing in climate, into which the
                  tropics of Cancer and Capricorn and the Arctic and Antarctic
                  circles divide the surface of the earth&#8217; \u2013 that is,

                              marks out space, enclosing and dividing at once,
                              as reflected in its\u00a0vaguer sense from 1559 as
                              &#8216;any region extending round the earth and
                              comprised between definite limits&#8217;, where it
                              is also applied to &#8216;a similar region in the
                              heavens or on the surface of a
                              planet&#8217;.<\/p>\n

                                Of course, the Ancient Egyptians gave the

                                    Egyptian art as a naked woman arched over

                                    tiptoes, and often covered in stars, from
                                    which position she protects the sun god Ra,
                                    and the earth below \u2013 a
