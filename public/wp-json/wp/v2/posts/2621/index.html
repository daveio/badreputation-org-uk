                    war and their allegiance to the Capitol, the Districts must

                    chosen by lottery, to fight to the death in games shown on
                    national television. For one winner comes fame, a life of
                    guaranteed luxury, and food for their district for one year;
                    for the losers, nothing save the knowledge that their last
