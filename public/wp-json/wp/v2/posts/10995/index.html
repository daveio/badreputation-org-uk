  We found out about this fascinating film project through the lovely people at
  <a title=\"Birds Eye View\" href=\"http:\/\/www.birds-eye-view.co.uk\/\"
  target=\"_blank\">Bird&#8217;s Eye View Film Festival<\/a>.
  <strong
    >Hanna Sk\u00f6ld<\/strong> is writer and director of a film called
    <strong
      >Granny&#8217;s Dancing on the Table<\/strong>, \u201ca tale about
      predicting earthquakes and finding sex\u201d. In fact, it&#8217;s not just
      a film, it&#8217;s a story universe: a <a title=\"Granniverse\"
      href=\"http:\/\/granniverse.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Granniverse<\/a>,
      which includes an iPad game, street events and an international Granny Day
      to celebrate grandmothers everywhere.<\/p>\n
      <p>
        And something else that makes the project special is that it will be
        released with a <a title=\"Creative Commons UK\"
        href=\"http:\/\/www.creativecommons.org.uk\/\"
        target=\"_blank\">Creative Commons<\/a> licence at the cinema and
        online, at the same time. Sk\u00f6ld is calling for a film distribution
        revolution which will take the power of storytelling out of the hands of
        a few large corporations and put it back in the hands of the people. If
        anyone can do it, it sounds like Sk\u00f6ld can: her first feature,
        <strong
          >Nasty Old People<\/strong>, premiered in 2009 on the front page of
          The Pirate Bay. The movie was spread online in 113 countries, has been
          translated into 17 different languages by the audience, and was even
          screened on Swedish television.<\/p>\n

                <p>
                  &#8220;The story universe emerges from the story about Eini, a
                  lonely girl who grows up outside society. She feels
                  unconnected and she doesn\u2019t belong anywhere. But she has
                  a big imaginative world, and fantasizes about her granny. She
                  runs away from home and goes on a journey to discover the
                  world, but she also starts to discover herself, her sexuality;
                  she finds some people where she can belong. All the time, her
                  granny is some kind of spirit, watching over
                  her.&#8221;<\/p>\n

                    <p>
                      &#8220;We need them. I need them. They are invisible, in
                      the history, in the culture of today, in my everyday life.
                      If you don\u2019t have a direct relation with your own
                      granny, there are not many places you meet
                      grannies.<\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In Granniverse, the Granny is a metaphor for some things
                      that gets lost in our society. We all have Grannies, we
                      all have stories and feelings about our Grannies, but
                      still old women are made almost invisible in our society.
                      What consequences will this have, which part of our
                      history has been lost because of this? What would happen
                      if that changed? Would life for young men and women of
                      today, or tomorrow, be different?<\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      By playing with the concept of Granny and the meanings we
                      give it, we aim to inspire both the imagination and the
                      reality of the possible answers to these questions.<\/p>\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Granniverse can be seen as an experiment to make always
                      existing, but invisible parts of society
                      visible!&#8221;<\/p>\n

                          &#8220;I hardly met them. And this is a big loss in my
                          life. My grandmother on my fathers side died when I
                          was 11, and I only met her a few times. My grandmother
                          on my mother&#8217;s side, the same. I grew up very
                          very isolated myself, that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t
                          meet them. I think that\u2019s why I tell this
                          story.&#8221;<\/p>\n

                            sweet old biddies. Why do you think there are so few

                              &#8220;I think it\u2019s because we don\u2019t
                              meet them naturally in our daily lives. Many old
                              people are at homes for old people, and we have a
                              way to separate people from each other &#8211; due
                              to their age. And especially old women lose a lot
                              of attention, they are not counted anymore, and I
                              think this is because we have too few role models
                              in the history. And also, many young women live
                              all their lives as objects, and not as
                              subjects.&#8221;<\/p>\n

                                  &#8220;It\u2019s crucial. Because it\u2019s

                                  already some kind of status, in a way that the
                                  granny doesn\u2019t. But it doesn\u2019t have
                                  to be the biological granny. I could maybe
