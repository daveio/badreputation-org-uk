  Won&#8217;t you have another cucumber sandwich? Why, I don&#8217;t know what
  you mean, they taste just fine to me&#8230;<\/p>\n

  I love the clich\u00e9s of twee British TV murder mysteries &#8211; the
  village fete, the teacup switch, the gunshot in the dark room \u2013 but what
  I like best is the presence of lots of fantastic old ladies, a group which are
  underrepresented in nearly every other type of television genre.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  In 1999, people over 60 made up 21 percent of the UK population, but just 7
  percent of the television population (<a

  target=\"_blank\">source<\/a>) and in 2012 a <a
  href=\"http:\/\/downloads.bbc.co.uk\/diversity\/pdf\/serving_all_ages_acc.pdf\"
  target=\"_blank\">BBC report (PDF)<\/a> flagged the absence of older women on
  TV as a major problem.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  I&#8217;ve said in <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/2011\/01\/13\/the-hearing-trumpet-surrealism-feminism-and-old-lady-revolt\/\">another
  post<\/a> that for the most part in popular culture, old women are given one
  of just two identities: dear old biddy or evil crone. In Twee British Murder
  there is a greater range of stereotypes to be found, although the biddy\/crone
  dichotomy is still there. Through by no means a comprehensive list, I&#8217;ve
  identified five overlapping Twee British Murder character options for older
  women.<\/p>\n

    An army of elderly female housekeepers, cooks, nurses, cleaners and
    secretaries form a vital part of the machinery of Twee British
    Murder.<\/p>\n
  </p>
  <p>
    Although they are rarely the killer, and tend to be only incidental victims
    (when they Know Too Much, for example) they have a vital dramatic function,
    especially as witnesses.<\/p>\n
  </p>
  <p>
    The cook remembers that someone different from usual offered to take the
    breakfast tray up to her mistress, the former nanny recalls a crucial detail
    from a suspect&#8217;s past&#8230;<\/p>\n
  </p>
  <p>
    It&#8217;s these long-suffering souls that make up the bulk of body-finders
    too, although they&#8217;re almost always questioned and dismissed with no
    further contribution except looking anxious.<\/p>\n
  </p>
  <p>
    But why are the servants and employees so swiftly ruled out? This 1928
    article, <a href=\"http:\/\/gaslight.mtroyal.ca\/vandine.htm\"
    target=\"_blank\"><strong
      >20 Rules for Writing Detective Fiction<\/strong><\/a>, states
      that:<\/p>\n
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          A servant must not be chosen by the author as the culprit. This is
          begging a noble question. It is a too easy solution. The culprit must
          be a decidedly worth-while person \u2014 one that wouldn&#8217;t
          ordinarily come under suspicion.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course! Servants are a bunch of crims already: making one of them
          the murderer would be TOO OBVIOUS.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          Moving on. An atypical member of this category is Sherlock
          Holmes&#8217; tolerant landlady, Mrs Hudson. This is from
          <strong
            >The Adventure of the Dying Detective<\/strong>:<\/p>\n
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                The landlady stood in the deepest awe of him and never dared to
                interfere with him, however outrageous his proceedings might
                seem. She was fond of him, too, for he had a remarkable
                gentleness and courtesy in his dealings with
                women.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n

                      Often bedridden, with elaborate medical care requirements,
                      and generally found in a spooky old house surrounded by
                      squabbling, grasping relatives, these women are often
                      trying to make a last minute change to their will when
