<p>Hello, I&#8217;m Miranda and I am into illustration.<\/p>\n</p>
<p>
  Illustration &#8211; or, as Wikipedia rather charmingly defines it, art
  <em
    >created to elucidate or dictate sensual information<\/em> &#8211; is really
    important to me. It&#8217;s basically what I would do
    <em
      >all the time<\/em> if I had my way. And I&#8217;m not the only arty
      person on Team BadRep, either, <a
      href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/tag\/markgrafs-movie-adventures\/\">as
      you<\/a> <a
      href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/category\/alphabet\/\">may
      know<\/a>. One of the things I&#8217;ve enjoyed most about being part of
      this site, in fact, is the opportunities it has raised for me to discover
      new illustrators from around the world, including <a
      href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/2011\/05\/09\/fairy-tale-fest-the-best-adaptation-of-the-little-mermaid-ive-ever-seen\/\">feminist
      Gond tribal art<\/a> and <a
      href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/2011\/11\/03\/parcel-from-india\/\">east
      Indian Mithili art<\/a>. As I write this, I&#8217;m awaiting my copy of <a
      href=\"http:\/\/www.tarabooks.com\/blog\/?p=791\"><strong
        >Sita&#8217;s Ramayana<\/strong> from Tara Books<\/a>, so I&#8217;ll be
        talking about that on here soon.<\/p>\n
        <p>
          This, though, is a quick post about illustrators I&#8217;m especially
          digging this minute. Each of them has done some work that I found
          interesting and beautiful with the added dimension that it also got my
          feminist braincogs turning, or straight up made me smile.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          I&#8217;ll probably come back to this topic every so often, but to
          start with here&#8217;s some people you should check out.<\/p>\n

                            art fair Markgraf and I had a stall at, and I picked
                            up issues 1 and 2 of his comic
                            <strong
                              >The Lengths<\/strong>. It&#8217;s now on issue 5.
                              In his own words (quoted <a
                              href=\"http:\/\/forbiddenplanet.co.uk\/blog\/2011\/the-lengths-issue-2\/\">here<\/a>),
                              &#8220;&#8230;it\u2019s a comic based around a
                              series of interviews I did with male escorts
                              working in London a few years ago and tells the
                              story of Eddie, one young escort&#8230; who\u2019s
                              struggling with trying to do the job while craving
                              both the adventure it offers him and the prospect
                              of a relationship with an old
                              friend&#8221;.<\/p>\n
                              <p>
                                It is also very good. It&#8217;s a thoughtful,
                                introspective comic, meandering poignantly
                                through ideas around sex work and attitudes to
                                it, selfhood and masculinities. I really like
                                his decision to portray all the characters as
                                human\/dog hybrids. It just works. <\/p>\n
