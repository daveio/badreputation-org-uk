  That&#8217;s correct, folks! \u00a0I trundled my way down to London last
  Thursday to insert myself into a world of new and upcoming games, developer
  sessions and general geekdom. \u00a0What&#8217;s even better is that <a
  title=\"Eurogamer\" href=\"http:\/\/www.eurogamer.net\/\"
  target=\"_blank\"><strong
    >Eurogamer<\/strong><\/a> were kind enough to give me a press pass to do so,
    and now, my dear readers, you get to hear all about it!<\/p>\n
    <p>
      First of all, this post right here is going to be a general look at the
      whole experience, and I&#8217;ll give you some insight into what else I
      have in store for you in later posts. \u00a0Simple as that, really!
      \u00a0Shall we get started?<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      As I had to travel down from our second city in the morning I didn&#8217;t
      get into the Expo until close to midday. Even so, with a little ticket
      with the words &#8220;Press Pass&#8221; on I still got in without issue
      (even if they did give me the wrong wristband). \u00a0My brother had come
      along for the Thursday and was already inside, so I had a task trying to
      locate him. \u00a0In the end I gave up and darted straight to see <a
      title=\"RAGE official website\" href=\"http:\/\/www.rage.com\/en\"
      target=\"_blank\"><strong
        >Rage<\/strong><\/a> (coincidentally, so did he) as I am a mild <a

          anyone!<\/p>\n
          <p>
            After that I went to visit <a title=\"Special Effect\"
            href=\"http:\/\/www.specialeffect.org.uk\/\"
            target=\"_blank\"><strong
              >Special Effect<\/strong><\/a>&#8216;s World Record Attempt and
              did my practice run &#8211; you&#8217;ll be hearing more about
              this in a dedicated post &#8211; in which you have to complete a
              racing track using nought but your own eye movements. \u00a0These
              guys were there trying to raise awareness for gamers with
              disabilities who need modified controls to enjoy the world of
              gaming. \u00a0Very admirable, indeed. \u00a0I had a nice chat with
              one of them on the Friday and I will be urging you all to give
              them a shout however you can.<\/p>\n
              <p>
                After a bit of milling around I headed up for my interviews with
                <a title=\"Trion Worlds [English]\"
                href=\"http:\/\/www.trionworlds.com\/en\/\"
                target=\"_blank\"><strong

                    target=\"_blank\"><strong
                      >End of Nations<\/strong><\/a>. \u00a0I had a good hour
                      between the two and some interesting responses to
                      questions, but you&#8217;ll have to wait for the interview
                      posts to hear more about that.<\/p>\n
                      <p>
                        Over the course of the two days I also got round to
                        playing quite a few of the big names like <a

                                like <a title=\"Sega's Sonic Generations page\"

                                    \u00a0You&#8217;ll get to hear what I
                                    thought of all the games I played in my
                                    round-up post, which will include a series
                                    of mini-reviews for your delectation.<\/p>\n

                                      Another excellent facet to the Expo was
                                      the Indie Arcade and the Retro section
                                      &#8211; in which there was <a

                                        I hadn&#8217;t seen in years on consoles
                                        and arcades that are likely part of
                                        someone&#8217;s private gaming museum.
                                        \u00a0This and EG&#8217;s Game of the

                                          what I think about the prevalence of

                                              marketing; the assumption (several

                                              &#8220;new to FPS genre&#8221; or
