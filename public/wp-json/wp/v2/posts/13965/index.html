                  inclusive <a href=\"https:\/\/nineworlds.co.uk\/\"
                  target=\"_blank\">Nine Worlds<\/a> was about two minutes after
                  collecting my badge from the front desk. Wandering down the
                  corridor I found myself in&#8230; a <a

                  target=\"_blank\">geek feminism<\/a> session. <\/p>\n
                  <p>
                    &#8220;I was greeted cheerfully and given a quick intro to
                    what was going on, and then left to join the various groups
                    sitting around the (very popular) room at tables and in
                    small lively seated circles on the floor. The crowd in this
                    room didn\u2019t know my views or that I write for BadRep,
                    and I\u2019m a straight white male &#8211; generally not a
                    famously marginalised group &#8211; but I felt immediately
                    welcome. <\/p>\n

                  <p>
                    &#8220;In the next room along, Bronies were playing guitar
                    and handing out cupcakes. They also had a rave DJ. In that
                    moment, I suspected this wasn\u2019t going to be a typical
                    SF convention.&#8221;<\/p>\n

                        wasn&#8217;t groped, harassed, belittled or condescended
                        to. I felt comfortable enough to walk around dressed in
                        my own clothes, and not necessarily the elaborate armour
                        of ballgowns, cosplay or similar I&#8217;d adopted when
                        frequenting prior conventions. <\/p>\n

                          &#8220;More to the point, I felt comfortable enough to
                          go around ON MY OWN. I can&#8217;t stress this enough.
                          I stopped going to conventions because it had become
                          apparent to me that I was paying a great deal of money
                          to attend an event where it was pretty much guaranteed
                          that I would be assaulted in some way, whereas daily
                          assault is something most women can have for free
                          simply by walking down the street in London. Why pay
                          for the privilege?&#8221;<\/p>\n
