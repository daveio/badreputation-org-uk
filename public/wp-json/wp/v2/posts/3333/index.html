<p>Explain to me about supercars.<\/p>\n</p>
<p>
  No, seriously. If anyone out there has a clue, please write in and explain to
  me how anyone can consider them \u2018cool\u2019. Now, I like a<a
  href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Supercar\"> supercar<\/a> as much as
  the next person.\u00a0 Wait, scratch that. How can I say I like it? I\u2019ve
  never driven a supercar. I\u2019ve never touched one. I\u2019ve never even
  seen one in real life close up. (I will obviously have to make an effort at
  the next motorshow.) So how can I categorically state: yup, that one there,
  that\u2019s the one for me, the one with the bright orange paintjob and the
  rotating guns mounted on the spoiler?<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  I realise <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/2011\/03\/04\/secret-diary-of-a-female-petrolhead-%E2%80%93the-water-cooler-test\/\">I\u2019ve
  just finished telling you<\/a> that I am really quite partial to the <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.paganiautomobili.it\/zonda\/zonda_R\/default.aspx\">Zonda
  R<\/a>, but that\u2019s more of an abstract sort of love. I love it like I
  love Dali \u2013 I\u2019ve no idea what\u2019s going on with it, and would
  feel vaguely disturbed if I did. But to stand up and say, yup, I\u2019d love
  to own one? No.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_3335\" style=\"width: 310px\"

</p>
<p>
  And yet, despite that, I\u2019m having to wage battles over whether or not the
  <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lotuscars.com\/en\/lotus-exige\">Exige<\/a> \u2013 or
  the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.koenigsegg.com\/cars\/agera\/\">Agera<\/a>, or the
  <a href=\"http:\/\/www.astonmartin.com\/thecars\/one77\">One-77<\/a> \u2013 is
  cool, uncool or just too uncool for words. My logic, for anyone who is
  interested, is this:
  <em
    >if it looks like it\u2019s something a City banker would drive without a
    hint of irony, there are no words for how uncool it is. <\/em>Give it up
    now.<\/p>\n
    <p>
      Actually, I don\u2019t see why I should be having this argument at all,
      because it\u2019s my fridge, and my fridge magnets, and if I decide to
      have the Exige in the <a
      href=\"http:\/\/topgear.cloudapp.net\/default.aspx\">Uncool<\/a> section,
      on my own head be it. And still, out it came \u2013 \u201cbut look at it!
      It looks like the Batmobile!\u201d<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      There is, I suspect, a significant difference between engine enthusiasts
      and car enthusiasts. Both care about what the car has under the bonnet,
      but the car enthusiasts also care about <a
      href=\"http:\/\/www.venomgt.com\/gallery\/x1-top-gear-magazine\/\">whether
      or not it looks like a Batmobile<\/a>. Whereas I actively gravitate
      towards non-Batmobile cars (they don\u2019t go with my handbag).<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyway, the point is, I\u2019ve now had a few driving lessons, and have
      therefore been thinking about what car I would hypothetically buy once I
      pass my driving test (and before I move to my castle, complete with moat).
      Meanwhile, my instructor was telling me to stop giving way to people (why?
      They were busy and going somewhere, whereas I was driving in circles!) and
      hold my ground. I had to stop being so cooperative, otherwise I would be
      &#8216;forever taken advantage of&#8217;.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      While I was thinking about being less cooperative, I was cut up by a bloke
      driving a royal blue Ferrari. I can\u2019t swear as to the model, due to
      the extreme speed at which he almost ran me off the road, but its sloping
      front looked rather like a <a
      href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ferrari_Daytona\">Ferrari
      Daytona<\/a>. Suffice to say I was rather surprised to see one in Clapham,
      and even more surprised to nearly have it embed itself in the side of the
      <a
      href=\"http:\/\/www.fiat.co.uk\/showroom\/?id=10023#showroom\/new_500\">Fiat
      500<\/a> I was desperately trying not to stall.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, I thought.
      <em
        >That<\/em> is what I\u2019m supposed to do. That raw, unbridled
        aggre-<\/p>\n
        <p>
          \u201cWas that the same Ferrari I saw on the roundabout a few minutes
          ago?\u201d my instructor asked. I wouldn\u2019t know, since at the
          time I was trying to remember which turn I was meant to be taking. But
          if so &#8211;<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>\u201cWhy is that bloke driving around pointlessly?\u201d<\/p>\n</p>
        <p>
          As several Very Busy Persons behind me decided to improve my driving
          skills by honking their horns and pointing out that I should have
          allowed the Daytona-alike and my little Fiat to merge rather than
          braking and therefore delaying them by 3.4 seconds, I pondered the
          problem of the supercar. Even a Ferrari seemed a little pointless in
          South London. Surely anyone who drove one would either have to buy
          their own corner of Monte Carlo, or would otherwise have to face
          running for a pint of milk in something that looks like it should ram
          other cars for daring to share road space.<\/p>\n<div
