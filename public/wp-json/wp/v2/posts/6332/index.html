      Marian was born in Philadelphia in 1897, the eldest of three Anderson
      children. Her mother had previously worked as a school teacher but was
      unable to do so in Philadelphia due to stricter controls on the
      qualifications needed by black teachers as opposed to those for white
      teachers. The family was active in their local Union Baptist church, and
      Marian\u2019s aunt Mary encouraged her to sing with the church
      choir.<\/p>\n
    </p>
    <p>
      From age six onwards Marian began to sing at local concerts and functions,
      encouraged by her aunt. She had a clear talent from the start, and by her
      teens was earning several dollars for a performance.<sup

                teacher, and Anderson would credit him with expanding her
                repertoire to include classical works and arias in addition to
                choral music. She took these skills to the New York
                Philharmonic, winning a voice contest there in 1925. The prize
                was the chance to perform in concert with them, marking the

                    bookings due to racism, and like Baker she responded by
                    touring heavily in a more welcoming Europe. She toured
                    extensively through the 1930s, befriending many influential
                    people in the music field who were impressed with her voice.

                      For all her European success, there were still issues in
                      America. In 1939 Howard University sought to have her
                      perform at <a
                      href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/DAR_Constitution_Hall\">Constitution
                      Hall<\/a>. The hall was owned by the<a
                      href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Daughters_of_the_American_Revolution\">
                      Daughters of the American Revolution<\/a> (DAR), who
                      denied her the chance to play there on grounds of race.
                      This kicked off a storm with many DAR members resigning in
                      protest, including board member

                        aforementioned lovely example of people stepping up to
                        do the right thing. Eleanor Roosevelt, along with
                        Anderson\u2019s manager, members of the <a

                        and Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes arranged an
                        open air concert for Marian Anderson on the steps of the
                        Lincoln Memorial. The performance was a huge success,
                        attended by over 70,000 people, and with a million or so
                        more listening in by radio.<\/p>\n
                        <p>
                          Four years later the DAR asked Anderson to perform at
                          Constitution Hall. She accepted.<\/p>\n

                            Although she was trained for it and regularly
                            performed operatic arias in her concerts, Anderson
                            shied away from appearing in actual operas. She was
                            offered positions consistently throughout her time
                            in Europe, but felt she lacked the acting talent to
                            accompany her voice. The exception to this was
                            1955\u2019s appearance with the New York
                            Metropolitan Opera in a performance of <a

                                The next decade was studded with achievements
                                for Anderson, almost too many to give each one
                                the detail they deserve here. which frankly is
