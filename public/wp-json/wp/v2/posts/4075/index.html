  I&#8217;ve <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/2011\/01\/11\/avatar--no-the-other-one\/\">written
  previously for BadRep<\/a> on how the cartoon series
  <strong
    >Avatar: The Last Airbender<\/strong> is very feminist-friendly in its
    treatment of female characters. Women have important roles, the prejudices
    they face are explored and ridiculed, and they are counted as the most
    effective and capable warriors. There are equal numbers of them compared to
    the men in the group, and while the lead character is male that fact becomes
    almost unimportant in the weave of personal stories from the whole
    team.<\/p>\n
    <p>
      A new 12-part miniseries is being made, this time with a female character
      in the title role. This image of her has been released and is doing the
      rounds on fan blogs and so on, and some of the comments which have greeted
      it are very interesting.<\/p>\n<a

      Here are some of the initial replies I&#8217;ve seen (not exact

                    All of which might arguably be true, but that&#8217;s firmly
                    in the tradition of
                    <strong
                      >Avatar<\/strong> playing with gender in awesome ways. For
                      a start, the character of the Avatar is a holy person who
                      has reincarnated as male and female over the centuries.
                      They have a long line of both to call on for wisdom during
                      meditation.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_4081\"

                      <p>
                        In the original series, the Avatar is a boy named <a
                        href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Aang\"><strong
                          >Aang<\/strong><\/a>, who presents as relatively
                          gender-neutral: his young age and upbringing as a monk
                          make him quite androgynous, his head has no hair or
                          facial hair and he wears mainly shapeless robes. While
                          physical power and combat are key measures of success
                          for the world he lives in, Aang refuses to take the
                          hyper-masculine pose which is constantly encouraged.
                          He is instead always flying out of reach and using his
                          enemies&#8217; aggression to quickly slip behind them
                          to safety (a key technique of the <a
                          href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ba_gua\">Ba
                          Gua<\/a> martial art which his tribe learn). He
                          doesn&#8217;t judge or take sides, but is laughingly
                          delighted to meet anyone. He has been away from the
                          world, and society&#8217;s restrictions on gender
                          simply make no sense to him compared to love for your
                          fellow beings. Expectations of male and female conduct
                          are explored (and often refuted) by everyone around
                          him, but he stands alone in the centre. He is a
                          pacifist trickster, unique in the world.<\/p>\n
                          <p>
                            Tricksters in mythology are often linked to
                            exploration of gender roles. They can be
                            shapeshifters, disguise themselves as anyone, and
                            try out, or even master, traditional women&#8217;s
                            or men&#8217;s skills. Shamans in some communities
                            (who can in many ways embody the trickster role) may
                            not consider themselves to be male or female: some
                            cross-dress, or adopt the conventions of different
                            gender roles at different times. Tricksters are also
                            usually Outsiders. They all know loneliness and
                            derision, and can only succeed in their task if they
                            do NOT fit the safe confines of known social roles.
                            Aang is definitely an Outsider, and the lonely last
                            of his kind.<\/p>\n
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            The fact that the series can do all this while still
                            being a genuinely thrilling, hilarious and
                            entertaining children&#8217;s show is just one of
                            its strengths (do you get the impression I like it
                            quite a lot?) The attitude of neutrality with regard
                            to gender isn&#8217;t laboured, and as the episodes
                            progress Aang develops a hetero attraction towards a
                            female character, but by that point it doesn&#8217;t
                            feel like it was inevitable in a Hollywood kind of
                            way.<\/p>\n

                                  against as well. But at the end of the
