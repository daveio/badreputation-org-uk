    >This year, as many of us fill in the census, it&#8217;s also 100 years
    since the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.1911census.co.uk\/\">1911 census<\/a>,
    which women&#8217;s suffrage activists saw as another campaigning
    opportunity.<\/em><\/p>\n
    <p>
      One of the best and oddest moments in the Disney canon is the appearance,
      halfway through

        href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sister_Suffragette\">all-singing
        all-dancing campaign for civil liberties<\/a>. &#8216;Sister
        Suffragette&#8217; isn&#8217;t without its problems \u2013 the song is
        half-pisstake, half-pastiche, and the film makes Mrs Banks\u2019 dizzy
        preoccupation with Votes for Women another instance of parental neglect
        \u2013 but come on, it\u2019s a subversively fluffy aside that puts a
        smile on the face, and it\u2019s sometimes the first encounter with that
        fabulous creature, a suffragette, that people remember having.<\/p>\n
        <p>
          The <a
          href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Women%27s_suffrage_in_the_United_Kingdom\">campaign
          for women\u2019s suffrage in this country<\/a> is such a great story
          that I\u2019m surprised it\u2019s never been the subject of its own
          Disney film. Apart from its narrative of struggle towards a goal
          undeniably justified in modern eyes, it\u2019s got a whole array of
          glamorous heroines in petticoats and picture-hats and, eventually
          \u2013 after the false dawn of the 1918 Representation of the People
          Act which only included women property-owners aged over thirty \u2013
          a happy ending. In particular, the <a
          href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Women%27s_Social_and_Political_Union\">Suffragette<\/a>
          taste for militantly iconoclastic protest would lend itself to iconic
          on-screen moments: women chained to the Downing Street railings,
          smashing windows, <a

              Contrary to the Path\u00e9 News intertitle, Davison was not killed
              by her collision with George V\u2019s horse at the 1913 Epsom
              Derby, but died four days later of the injuries sustained. She was
              forty. When people say women died for your right to vote, a fair
              proportion of them will be thinking of her.<\/p>\n
            </p>
            <p>
              Davison\u2019s intentions on the day of the Derby are lost to
              history. Some historians believe her to have been intent on
              martyrdom, pointing to a previous incident during her imprisonment
              in<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Strangeways_Prison\">
              Strangeways<\/a> where she threw herself off a balcony. On the
              other hand, the fact that she had purchased a return train ticket
              &#8211; and also a ticket to a suffragette dance later that day
              &#8211; suggests that she intended to return having only
              interrupted or disrupted the race \u2013 possibly by attaching a
              suffragette flag to the King&#8217;s horse. This would have been
              one more instance of Davison\u2019s dedication to gaining
              attention for her chosen cause through publicity stunt and
              spectacle.<\/p>\n

              data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/a>Davison was born at Blackheath on
              11th October, 1872. Sylvia Pankhurst recalled her as &#8216;tall
              and slender&#8230; Her illusive, whimsical green eyes and thin,
              half-smiling mouth, bore often the mocking expression of the Mona
              Lisa&#8217;. She performed well at school, and defying many of the
              social orthodoxies imposed by Victorian society, won a place at
              Royal Holloway College, funding her own education through teaching
              work. In 1895 she studied for a term at Oxford, gaining First
              Class Honours in Modern Languages \u2013 despite, Oxford degrees
              being closed to women, having no opportunity to graduate. Having
              resumed her teaching career, Davison joined the Women&#8217;s
              Social and Political Union in 1906, quickly becoming its head
              steward as well as an active member of the socialist
              Workers&#8217; Educational Association and the Central Labour
              College.<\/p>\n

              Davison was one of around a thousand women imprisoned for
              political activities between 1903 and the outbreak of WWI. In
              March 1909, she was arrested for disturbance while attempting to
              hand a petition to the Liberal Prime Minister Herbert Asquith, and
              sentenced to one month in prison. Four months later, she attempted
              to gain access to a hall where the Chancellor of the Exchequer,
              David Lloyd George, was giving a speech, and was imprisoned for
              two months. Later in the same year, she and two other women were
              arrested for throwing stones at Lloyd George\u2019s car, and
              sentenced to a month\u2019s hard labour at Strangeways prison. The
              stones were wrapped in paper bearing Emily&#8217;s favourite
              saying:
              <em
                >Rebellion against tyrants is obedience to God.<\/em><\/p>\n
                <p>
                  While inside Strangeways, Davison went on hunger-strike. The
                  prison authorities, <a
                  href=\"http:\/\/www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk\/Whunger.htm\">in
                  line with government policy<\/a>, responded by force-feeding
                  her and, when she barricaded herself inside her cell to avoid
                  this, came close to causing her death by flooding the cell
                  with ice-cold water. This treatment appalled the public and
                  was discussed in Parliament, with Labour leader <a
                  href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Keir_Hardie\">James
                  Keir Hardie<\/a> advocating her release. Undaunted, Davison
                  spent the next few years in and out of prison for setting fire
                  to London post boxes, attacking a vicar she mistook for Lloyd
                  George, and planting a bomb which severely damaged Lloyd
                  George&#8217;s house in Surrey.<\/p>\n<div

                  The public response to Davison\u2019s death at the Epsom Derby
                  was not immediately sympathetic: more information was printed
                  about the health of the King\u2019s horse and jockey (the
                  latter making a full recovery and the former \u2018suffering
                  bruised shins\u2019) than about the suffragettes\u2019 cause,
                  and the Daily Herald went on to print <a
                  href=\"http:\/\/www.unb.ca\/democracy\/English\/Ideas\/Consent\/Civil\/ImagesDisobedience\/cartoon1.jpg\">a
                  cartoon in dubious taste showing \u2018Miss Davison\u2019 as a
                  skeleton holding a Votes For Women placard<\/a>. Posterity has
                  been scarcely kinder, dismissing Davison as a mentally ill
                  fanatic and proto-terrorist whose actions horrified both
                  supporters and opponents of her cause, and which enabled the
                  persistence of old arguments founded on the idea that
                  women\u2019s intrinsically irrational nature made them
                  unsuited to political discourse and decision-making. Populist
                  historian <a
                  href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Strange_Death_of_Liberal_England\">George
                  Dangerfield<\/a>\u2019s depiction of the suffragettes as a
                  frivolous frilly edge to the fall of Liberal England was a cue
                  picked up by succeeding historians, who viewed the majority of
                  women involved as playing at politics, succumbing to a
                  fashionably edgy craze, indulging their innate feminine
                  tendency to hysteria, and even masochistically courting the
                  treatment they received from police and prison authorities.
                  Not until the advent of women\u2019s history in the 1970s were
                  they treated more seriously and their struggle linked to that
                  for wider suffrage in earlier decades: the first Woman&#8217;s
                  Suffrage Bill was presented to Parliament in 1832, as part of
                  the general struggle for reform and extension of the franchise
                  to non-property-holding and working men. (It&#8217;s worth
                  pointing out that the King&#8217;s jockey at the 1913 Derby,
                  Herbert Jones, was not entitled to the vote either.)

                  Davison is buried at Morpeth Church with the WSPU motto
                  \u2018Deeds Not Words\u2019 engraved on her headstone.
                  Memorials to her are hard to find \u2013 like the suffragette
                  monument <a

                  away in Victoria<\/a> \u2013 but one is in the House of
                  Commons crypt, placed there by the Labour MP Tony Benn. It
                  commemorates the night of the 1911 census when Davison hid in
                  a cupboard in the Palace of Westminster overnight so that on
                  the census form she could legitimately give \u2018the House of
                  Commons\u2019 as her place of residence that night.
                  (Ironically enough, other suffragettes were spending the night
                  <a
                  href=\"http:\/\/hwj.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2011\/02\/21\/hwj.dbq064.full\">evading
                  the census<\/a> in protest at their exclusion from the
                  franchise.) The census documents from 2nd April 1911 state
                  that Davison was found &#8216;hiding in the crypt&#8217; in
                  the Houses of Parliament. Whatever the suffragettes\u2019
                  brand of protest represents today \u2013 a reckless eye for
                  spectacle, a disregard for personal safety and security in
                  pursuit of political goals, and a willingness to draw
                  attention to oneself, all of which are valid weapons in the
                  arsenal of political activists \u2013 escapades like that of
                  Emily Davison on census night are the kind of minor gems that
                  make the historical record sparkle.<\/p>\n
