            Everybody has an opinion about Quentin Tarantino. Is he racist for
            using the \u2018N\u2019 word so often in his scripts? Is he a
            genius, or a copycat? Is he some sort of sicko, in love with
            violence for its own sake? Can he act? (No, he can\u2019t.)<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            But underneath the gore, profanity, and wooden cameos, is there
            anything for feminists to celebrate? As unlikely as it sounds, I
            think there is.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            Tarantino has written some pretty amazing parts for women. He puts
            them on screen, not just as eye candy or the girlfriends of the
            heroes, but as people with stories of their own to tell. They know
            how to defend themselves and their friends, and they do their own
            stunts. They fight (and dance) barefoot, and aren\u2019t afraid to
            get their hands dirty.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            This isn\u2019t to say that the man himself is a feminist icon, or
            that his films are entirely unproblematic. Some of the violence
            perpetrated against the women characters has an uncomfortably
            voyeuristic feel to it, and every now and again his films feel more
            like depictions of his own sexual fantasies rather than true
            fiction. <a
            href=\"http:\/\/www.londonnet.co.uk\/cinema\/interviews\/inglourious-basterds-quentin-tarantino-interview\">He
            professes a love for \u2018strong women\u2019<\/a> (he grew up with
            a single mother), but this sexualisation of women characters does
            call his motives into question.<\/p>\n
          </p>
          <p>
            It\u2019s worth bearing in mind though, that these characters
            haven\u2019t sprung new and fully formed from Tarantino\u2019s
            imagination &#8211; they\u2019re loving reimaginations of the deadly
            but beautiful women of the B-movies and exploitation flicks
            Tarantino watched as a youngster. These women were usually a bit too
            \u2018empowered\u2019 for their own good, and often ended up getting
            their comeuppance. Dodgy source material, sure, but Tarantino
            regularly flips this trope on its head. The rapists, murderers and
            crooks in his movies rarely escape without feeling the wrath of
            their female \u2018victims\u2019.<\/p>\n

                As feminists, we sometimes have to dig about in the mud of
                misogyny to find some empowering gold dust. In honour of that,
                here\u2019s a rundown of the baddest, sassiest women in
                QT\u2019s weird world.<\/p>\n

                  \/><\/a>Oh, Mia Wallace. The woman who spawned a million
                  copycat hairstyles. She doesn\u2019t kick any ass, except in a
                  twist contest, but she\u2019s a seriously cool
                  customer.<\/p>\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  Did her husband Marsellus
                  <em
                    >really<\/em> throw a man over a balcony for giving her a
                    foot-rub? Maybe not, but it\u2019s easy to see why he might.
                    Everybody in the movie is afraid of him, and perhaps so is
                    Mia (she asks Vincent not to tell him about the overdose),
                    but she seems to do pretty much what she wants
                    anyway.<\/p>\n
                    <p>
                      She flirts with Vincent over dinner, and we never find out
                      what might have happened between them had she not mistaken
                      his heroin for cocaine. Something of an enigma, she\u2019s
                      a sassy, straight-talking woman with a preference for
                      silence over chatter (\u201cThat&#8217;s when you know
                      you&#8217;ve found somebody special. When you can just
                      shut the fuck up for a minute and comfortably enjoy the
                      silence.\u201d) This combination of beauty and brains
                      seems to have a profound effect on the men who meet her,
                      and enables her to survive in her world populated by
                      crooks and murderers.<\/p>\n

                        and the star of the movie that bears her name as its
                        title. In the youth-obsessed, whitewashed culture of
                        Hollywood, this is exciting and unusual in itself
                        (depressing, huh?).<\/p>\n

                        attendant, who works for a crappy airline. She makes
                        some extra bucks on the side by smuggling in ill-gotten
                        cash for a gun-dealer named Ordell, until she gets
                        busted.<\/p>\n

                        As she says: \u201cWell, I&#8217;ve flown seven million
                        miles. And I&#8217;ve been waiting on people almost 20
                        years. The best job I could get after my bust was Cabo
                        Air, which is the worst job you can get in this
                        industry. I make about sixteen thousand, with retirement
                        benefits that ain&#8217;t worth a damn. And now with
                        this arrest hanging over my head, I&#8217;m scared. If I
                        lose my job I gotta start all over again, but I got
                        nothing to start over with. I&#8217;ll be stuck with
                        whatever I can get. And that shit is scarier than
                        Ordell.\u201d<\/p>\n

                        But Jackie is a survivor in the truest sense of the
                        word. When things look bad for her, she takes matters
                        into her own hands, using her brains and courage to rip
                        off the gangsters and escape a jail sentence in one
                        outrageously brave scheme.<\/p>\n

                        She plans everything herself, knows who she can trust,
                        and isn\u2019t afraid to turn a gun on a man who she
                        knows to be a killer. She\u2019s a smart, older, black
                        woman who, despite being a total fox (<a

                        get ahead. With media portrayal of black women usually
                        relying heavily on sexualized stereotypes, Jackie Brown
                        is a breath of fresh air.<\/p>\n

                          \/><\/a>When people talk about \u2018empowered\u2019
                          female characters in Tarantino movies, Beatrix Kiddo
                          is who they\u2019re usually thinking of. The woman is
                          dragged through hell backwards, and still manages to
                          exact bloody revenge on everybody who hurt her, or
                          kept her from her child.<\/p>\n
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The trope of the vengeful woman is not a particularly
                          progressive one. But Beatrix Kiddo is no <a
                          href=\"http:\/\/www.urbandictionary.com\/define.php?term=bunny%20boiler\">\u2018bunny
                          boiler\u2019<\/a>. She was shot in the head and left
                          for dead, raped whilst in a coma, and led to believe
                          that her unborn child had died. As much as we might

                          She\u2019s a woman who knows how to protect herself,
                          and believes her life is worth fighting for. Even when
                          she\u2019s been buried alive, it\u2019s still
                          impossible to see her as a victim. And she\u2019s not
                          the only strong woman in the film (although she\u2019s
                          the only one you\u2019re rooting for).<\/p>\n

                              terrifying ferocity. They\u2019re fighting for

                                But The Bride isn\u2019t just violent and
                                vengeful. She\u2019s a mother who longs to be
                                reunited with her child. Somehow, this duality
                                doesn\u2019t cause the dissonance you would
                                expect. She\u2019s a three-dimensional
                                character, more than capable of being many
                                different things at once. The shock of that
                                highlights just how rare it is in a Hollywood
                                film.<\/p>\n

                                          In the real world, women rarely
                                          receive justice for the violence they
                                          experience. Although this
                                          vigilante-style justice is probably
                                          not what we want for our own society
                                          (however satisfying it might be),
                                          watching it on screen is incredibly
                                          cathartic. When Abernathy puts the
                                          final boot into Stuntman Mike, the
                                          urge to cheer is almost
