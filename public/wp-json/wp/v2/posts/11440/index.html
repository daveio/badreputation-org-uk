          When
          <strong
            >The Hunger Games<\/strong> came out, we were faced with possibly
            the most ludicrous and yet most predictable controversy in recent
            film history: was Katniss Everdeen too fat? More specifically, was
            Jennifer Lawrence the wrong body-shape to play the protagonist of
            these phenomenally successful novels, as a number of critics and
            fans said? One quotation from the <a

              <blockquote>
                <p>
                  A few years ago Ms. Lawrence might have looked hungry enough
                  to play Katniss, but now, at 21, her seductive, womanly figure
                  makes a bad fit for a dystopian fantasy about a people starved
                  into submission.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n

                  I\u2019m not going to answer the question, because,

                  matters, because it\u2019s not something so ludicrous we can

                      Essentially, these readers were arguing the case for
                      realism. Katniss has access to limited calories (though
                      more than some other people, due to her own skills) \u2013
                      this is part of the plot, theme and indeed title of the
                      novel \u2013 so an actor of a certain body\u00a0type might
                      be less able to inhabit the role convincingly onscreen.

                        Jennifer Lawrence was expected to appear strikingly

                        It\u2019s a simple biological fact.<\/p>\n
                        <p>
                          Except, of course, that fact assumes that the

                            >Hunger Games<\/strong> trilogy, beloved of teenage
                            girls in particular, is taking place in a cultural
                            vacuum. That it just happens to involve a young
                            woman with a fraught relationship to food, who is
                            contrasted to the decadence and self-indulgence of
                            the inhabits of the Capitol and other characters.
                            I\u2019m absolutely not arguing that these are
                            harmful books, or that they\u2019re written
                            thoughtlessly. Nor is it my place to tell young
                            women how they should interact with art. But I am
                            pointing out that novels don\u2019t become popular
                            for no reason, particularly YA novels with strong
                            female leads.<\/p>\n

                              factors which bear on the novels increase
                              drastically when it comes to putting Katniss on
                              screen. Again, there is an argument that the
                              fictional situation happens to involve a character
                              who would have a particular physical appearance.
                              But that discourse of realism and
                              \u201caccuracy\u201d totally ignores the hundreds
                              of images which young women are bombarded with
                              every day. It assumes that young women are never
                              told they\u2019re too fat or too skinny, that they
                              lack self control or a sense of proportion, that
                              their success in life is directly related to their
                              dress size. It assumes that when actors like
                              Jennifer Lawrence relax in between film-shoots,
                              there aren\u2019t packs of photographers with
                              zoom-lenses feeding the websites which police
                              their bodies and point out how they\u2019ve
                              \u201clet themselves go\u201d. Talk about
                              \u201caccuracy\u201d is deeply naive because it
                              ignores the way actors\u2019 public personas are
                              constructed, how their lifestyle is carefully
                              confused with the roles they choose and how their
                              bodies are used in advertising. It also ignores
                              the power of performance to draw us into a
                              fictional world and convince us of its reality,
                              surely one of the main reasons anyone films a book
                              in the first place.<\/p>\n

                              So much for the hungry girl, but I don\u2019t
                              think we can ignore the post-apocalyptic world and
                              its relevance to this controversy. Katniss
                              isn\u2019t just a young woman who finds herself
                              short on nosh after the shops have shut,
                              she\u2019s the central figure in a futuristic
                              wasteland. \u201cPost-apocalyptic\u201d has also
                              come in for a bit of controversy recently, with
                              Mark Kermode demanding with typically entertaining
                              zeal that if the apocalypse is the end of the
                              world, then how can a film be post-apocalyptic? If
                              the apocalypse has happened, and there\u2019s
                              anything left to have a film about, then that my
                              friend is a shoddy apocalypse and you want to
                              demand another one, that works like it says on the
                              packet. Highly pleasing as this is, and far be it
                              from me to out-pedant the worshipful Doctor, but
                              apocalypse does not mean the end of the
                              world.<\/p>\n
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Apocalypse means \u201crevelation\u201d or the
                              \u201clifting of the veil\u201d. The book we get
                              most of our apocalyptic imagery from \u2013 four
                              horsemen, 666, Whore of Babylon riding on a
                              seven-headed beast, you know the drill \u2013 is
                              referred to as both the Apocalypse of St. John and
                              the Book of Revelation. The fact that the most
                              famous one is most frequently framed as a vision
                              of the end of the world means that we tend to
                              assume that they\u2019re the same thing (if
                              we\u2019re not massive pedants and unhealthily
                              obsessed with etymology &#8211; oh no,
                              wait&#8230;). But the crucial aspect is the
                              \u201clifting of the veil\u201d, the revealing of
                              a deeper reality which is obscured by the world
                              around us.<sup

                                  I\u2019m not bringing this up for the sake of
                                  sheer quibble (though that would be reason
                                  enough), but because I think a lot of
                                  post-apocalyptic fiction still has this
                                  original meaning embedded in it. So many
                                  post-apocalyptic films and novels have this
                                  sense of being not only \u201cafter the
                                  disaster\u201d but also \u201cafter the
                                  revelation\u201d, trying to strip back the
                                  complexities and confusions of modern life to
                                  get to what is basic and essential about us.
