  <strong
    >The Cape<\/strong> is a new TV series from NBC which tries to recapture the
    atmosphere of pulp comics and mix it with an exciting modern action show. It
    could be entertaining&#8230; if they changed nearly everything about it.
    (Spoilers follow, but in this reviewer\u2019s opinion you\u2019re not
    missing much by finding out early).<\/p>\n
    <p>
      I don\u2019t mean to be too negative. There is a lot that
      <strong
        >The Cape<\/strong> does very well, but each good part is immediately
        contradicted by the next scene, as though they locked twenty writers in
        a room with some foam rubber baseball bats. Mostly it\u2019s a conflict
        of tone: there\u2019s a lot of murder and violence, but it then tries to
        be a sappy \u2018father and son\u2019 show or fun-filled comic-book
        adventure as well two minutes later.<\/p>\n
        <p>
          Vince Faraday (played by David Lyons) is one of the last honest
          policemen in a city where the entire force is about to be owned openly
          by a private corporation. He is Rugged, and White, and has a Jaw. In
          fact, he\u2019s so generic and unmemorable that I have problems
          recalling his face right now.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          There\u2019s a problem with needing to cast an actor who has a
          physique that only a dedicated bodybuilder could ever achieve, and
          that is that most of your potential candidates are bodybuilder-actors.
          There is a small subset of these who are great for action films with
          zero dialogue but actually a hindrance when your story hinges on the
          hero\u2019s personality, because they have just&#8230; too much&#8230;
          testosterone. It\u2019s obvious to everyone that they\u2019re
          obsessively driven to work out every day, and not very happy because
          of it. In short, your leading man is always dangerously close to just
          being a bug-eyed gym bunny. And there\u2019s a hint of that here; the
          lead is frequently too aggressive or twitchy to be sympathetic.<\/p>\n

            can&#8217;t even remember the character&#8217;s name &#8211; look,
            he&#8217;s practically silent for most of the episode once
            we&#8217;ve established his dynamic with the hero. He seems to be
            doing a bad impression of the (rather wonderful) Romany Malco from
            <strong
              >No Ordinary Family<\/strong> (who despite being an assistant
              District Attorney is still very much a
              <em
                >Black Sidekick<\/em> but does at least make it clear that
                he\u2019s fanboy-excited to be so, and has real lines). James
                Frain is the terribly-English bad guy. He was creepy to the
                point of terrifying in
                <strong
                  >True Blood<\/strong>, mostly because his dialogue was
                  straight from the \u201cabusive relationship\u201d manual to a
                  triggery level, but here he is simply&#8230; English.<\/p>\n

                    Sadly, not only is it yet AGAIN all about two white men and
                    the bit-players around them, but the female parts are
                    terrible. It <a

                    Bechdel<\/a> straight off the bat, as I don\u2019t recall
                    two women even meeting let alone speaking to each other. If
                    they did, it would be about the male lead because
                    everything, even other people getting killed and his family
                    thinking he\u2019s dead, is about the square-jawed male
                    lead.<\/p>\n

                    Geek favourite Summer Glau is surprisingly good, in the
                    minute or so of screentime that she gets. She is in two
                    scenes, one of which involves exchanging two lines with the
                    hero and the other requiring her to peer at a hi-tech
                    computer screen meaningfully while he goes into town to take
                    down the bad guy. She finally seems visibly older than some
                    of us might remember from series like
                    <strong
                      >Firefly<\/strong> (and even
                      <strong
                        >Terminator: SCC<\/strong>), and it\u2019s given her
                        much more credibility when she plays emotion or
                        urgency.<\/p>\n

                          Summer does have one last moment as he hurries to

                                  As a line it\u2019s enigmatic and mysterious,
                                  hinting at a possibly tragic past and heroic
                                  motivations. She clearly

                                    her statement is almost true: she gets maybe
                                    four lines of dialogue and is put on a shelf
                                    marked \u201cto be explored later when we
                                    have time, because this pilot is full
                                    already\u201d. I have no doubt AT ALL that
                                    this is due to time constraints, so
                                    I&#8217;ll wait to see how she&#8217;s

                                        them. In a few weeks or so. Maybe days,

                                              tall. He is easily the scariest
                                              individual in the room and never
                                              doubts his ability to take anyone
                                              else in a fight (consequently
                                              rarely losing). His endless
                                              insults and energy are a delight
                                              in a show so otherwise
