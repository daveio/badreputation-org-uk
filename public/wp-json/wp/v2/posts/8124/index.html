  Last week I discovered that some friends of mine had not seen Joss
  Whedon&#8217;s 2006 <a
  href=\"http:\/\/jossisahottie.com\/josswhedon\/entranscript.html\">Equality
  Now acceptance speech<\/a>. As I promptly sent them <a
  href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=cYaczoJMRhs\">the youtube link<\/a>,
  I remembered how powerful some of the phrases he uses are. For me it&#8217;s
  not about the endless frustrating fixation by reporters on his &#8220;Strong
  Women Characters&#8221;, but what Joss says when he pauses to talk about his
  feelings on sexism:<\/p>\n
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    &#8220;Equality is not a concept. It&#8217;s not something we should be
    striving for. It&#8217;s a necessity. Equality is like gravity. We NEED it
    to stand on this earth as men and women.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<div

  <p>
    We NEED equality. That&#8217;s an incredible statement. It&#8217;s those
    capital letters which impress me &#8211; ignore that it&#8217;s a now-rich
    white guy saying it and look at the passion in those words. He&#8217;s
    saying that equality is not optional. It&#8217;s not something for only
    people with too much luxury and free time to turn their attention to.<\/p>\n
  </p>
  <p>
    And he makes it clear that this belief comes from his parents teaching him
    that the rights and respect we should give to &#8216;people&#8217;
    don&#8217;t only apply to straight, white, cis males who behave in approved
    ways. It certainly doesn&#8217;t immediately stop applying to 51% of the
    human race &#8211; all other human beings get those rights as well. Why is
    this concept so revolutionary after all this time? Why are we having to
    campaign to <a
    href=\"http:\/\/allout.org\/en\/actions\/wearenotillegal\">stop
    homosexuality still being illegal in so much of the Commonwealth<\/a>, for a
    start?<\/p>\n
  </p>
  <p>
    I certainly feel equality as something we &#8216;need&#8217;. I&#8217;m
    unable to hold my head up as a man while my country treats people in all the
    bigoted, ingrained ways it still does. It seems blindingly obvious to me,
    but in my case didn&#8217;t come from sentiments in the home growing up, or
    from the attitudes of my parents (who keep surprising me with how socially
    conservative they are). Yet the UK is far ahead of many others: I&#8217;m
    visiting Belgrade (the capital of Serbia) right now and the government
    recently decided not to
    <em
      >allow<\/em> a Gay Pride march because <a
      href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-europe-15134182\">they
      wouldn&#8217;t be able to protect the marchers from massive violence<\/a>.
      At least they&#8217;re not one of the countries handing out prison
      sentences, or death sentences.<\/p>\n
      <p>
        Making a statement that I feel personally affected by inequality against
        groups I&#8217;m not technically part of is usually the point at which
        I&#8217;m told I&#8217;m not allowed to have an opinion &#8211; that I
        just have &#8216;White Middle-class Guilt&#8217; for example. Well,
        there&#8217;s nothing wrong with that guilt as long as it leads to
        campaigning and action instead of the typical corresponding middle-class
        &#8216;slacktivism&#8217;. The idea that those outside of the group in
        question shouldn&#8217;t feel strongly about an issue would mean that
        straight people can&#8217;t be against homophobia &#8211; it&#8217;s
        ridiculous. And Whedon says so:<\/p>\n
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          The misogyny that is in every culture is not a true part of the human
          condition. It is life out of balance, and that imbalance is sucking
          something out of the soul of every man and woman who is confronted
          with it.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          The imbalance affects him, and everyone else. Equality isn&#8217;t
          something to be sorted out after we tackle the other issues of
          society, it&#8217;s not an optional nice-to-have on top of the cake,
          it&#8217;s an urgent and real NEED which affects the whole
          population.<\/p>\n
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether or not you think Whedon succeeds in promoting gender equality
          in his movies and TV, that speech is still stunning. Every time I post
          the link new friends find it for the first time and are awed, and
          others feel the need to pass it on once again. Five years later and it
          still needs saying, so (almost exactly a year after that <a
          href=\"http:\/\/www.badreputation.org.uk\/2010\/10\/12\/the-bottom-rung-of-the-ladder\/\">first
          BadRep post<\/a> I made on it) I wanted to quickly share it in case we
          have even one or two of you who will see it fresh and feel
          inspired.<\/p>\n

          In less feminist-focused recent Joss news, he&#8217;s just filmed <a

            friends, which means people like Amy Acker (<strong
              >Angel<\/strong>&#8216;s Fred) and Alexis Denisof (Wesley) as the
              lovers Beatrice and Benedick. Nathan Fillion and Fran Kranz are in
              there too. Oh, and he didn&#8217;t tell the press until shooting
              was finished, when it got &#8216;casually&#8217; mentioned on
              Twitter. I&#8217;ve been a fanboy of his work for a while now and
              still can&#8217;t watch those two leads in the last season of
