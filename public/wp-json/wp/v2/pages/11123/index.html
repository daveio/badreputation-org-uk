  BadRep Towers is home to quite a few people &#8211; we are a close-knit team,
  and we can still fit round a large table in the pub, but we&#8217;ve expanded
  to roughly double the size we were when we started. (We absorb awesome people.
  Like a really energetic sponge. But not like the Borg. That would be a PR fail
  for feminism.)<\/p>\n

  Core Team<\/h2>\n
  <h3>
    Miranda (editor)<\/h3>\n
    <p>
      Miranda started BadRep up in the summer of 2010 after taking refuge from
      the heatwave in the local pub, running into some future team members and
      excitedly blurting about blogs at them from somewhere under her fringe.
      Happily, everyone she pestered was interested. She is fond of boxing, Joan
      Jett, spending too much of her salary on music, and the overuse of her
      caps lock key.<\/p>\n

    <h3>
      Sarah Jackson (assistant editor)<\/h3>\n
      <p>
        The First Mate of the Bad Ship Reputation, Sarah J is a shameless
        introvert cursed with an interest in people. Aged nine, she took on a
        school bully and was awarded a medal (a 10p piece sellotaped to a bit of
        string) by her classmates. She\u2019s never looked back in the fight for
        what\u2019s right, and now works in charity communications making the
        world a better place one email at a time. She\u2019s on a lifelong quest
        for genderjustice, and enjoys writing about robots, the uncanny,
        indiepop, comics, cities, forests, and fairytales.<\/p>\n
