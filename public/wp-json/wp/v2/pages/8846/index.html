<p>
  In a nutshell, we&#8217;re a group of friends &#8211; of a variety of genders
  &#8211; based in the UK. Most of us are varying levels of geeky in one form or
  another.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  That&#8217;s about it, really. We can&#8217;t claim to speak for all of
  feminism (or all of anybody) but we like nattering about gender, pop culture,
  and the internet, so here we are.<\/p>\n
</p>
<p>
  We try to be welcoming to readers still dipping their toe into this whole
  &#8220;feminist outlook&#8221; business. We think feminism&#8217;s bad
  reputation in large sections of the media (or your local pub) these days is
  irksome, and we can&#8217;t be doing with it.<\/p>\n
</p>

    >We dig:<\/strong><\/p>\n
    <ul>
      \n
      <li>
        making you think about gender and equality issues, and how they interact
        with pop culture, over your Monday morning coffee break<\/li>\n
      </li>
      <li>recommending media we like<\/li>\n</li>
      <li>
        nerding out about &#8216;geek media&#8217; things like comics and cult
        TV, but also history, art, theatre, and things we happen to be nerdy
        about, most of which we believe can have feminist perspectives applied
        to them, with interesting results<\/li>\n
      </li>
      <li>challenging a number of popular stereotypes of feminism<\/li>\n</li>
      <li>intersectional approaches to feminism and life in general<\/li>\n</li>
      <li>
        having some fun. No, really! This site is intended to be interesting and
        enjoyable, a place where the writers that make up Team BR can talk about
        what they find interesting.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n
        <p>
          One of our core aims is to Not Leave It At A Rant: if we don&#8217;t
          like something, we&#8217;ll try to suggest something else to
          read\/watch\/buy\/advocate\/shout about\/hope for\/do. This
          isn&#8217;t always possible\u00a0<em
            >all<\/em>\u00a0the time, because systematic gender inequality,
            quite frankly, is not exactly cause for frolicking sweetness and
            light round the clock, but we give it our best shot.<\/p>\n
            <p>
              We hope that this&#8217;ll help, you, the reader, discover more
              stuff you might enjoy or positive actions you can take, and if
              this whole feminism-bad-rep thing&#8217;s getting you down a bit,
              remember that it&#8217;s not all bad.\u00a0Aside from that, we
              have few &#8216;party lines&#8217; and may even disagree on many
              things!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"
