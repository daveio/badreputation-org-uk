					<description><![CDATA[The other week I went to see the all-female cast production of Julius Caesar at the Donmar Warehouse.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The other week I went to see the all-female cast production of <strong>Julius Caesar</strong> at London&#8217;s <a title="Donmar Warehouse Theatre Website" href="http://www.donmarwarehouse.com/whats-on/donmar-warehouse/2012/julius-caesar" target="_blank">Donmar Warehouse</a>.</p>
<p>Directed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phyllida_Lloyd" target="_blank">Phyllida Lloyd</a>, this is a gritty, bold production set in a women’s prison – and performed in a very small, intimate theatre space. This is almost punk rock Shakespeare, and occasionally it <em>has</em> some punk rock in it. If the Pussy Riot reference poster doesn’t clue you in already: this is a production with guts.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar_(play)" target="_blank"><strong>Julius Caesar</strong></a> isn’t a play I’ve studied in much depth, and I know plenty of other reviewers will do a better academic job, so I’m going to focus on what I liked about it:</p>
<ol>
<li>More parts to female actors! Hooray! Also, the production necessitates a certain degree of queer/genderqueer acceptance, as both Brutus and Caesar’s wives play a significant part in the story. Get on board and get on with the plot.</li>
<li>The initial prison set-up is ingenious, and really adds a few layers for the first half – Caesar is a much-loved but bullying top dog in the setting. And one of the first things Frances Barber&#8217;s Caesar does when she comes on stage is smooch Mark Anthony (Cush Jumbo). Whoa! That makes… a lot of sense, actually, and adds a brilliant ambiguity to the characters’ different declarations of love for each other.</li>
<li>Did I mention punk rock? There’s a bit of live music with a drumkit on wheels used to brilliant effect.</li>
<li>The soothsayer is presented as the clearly-slightly-unhinged inmate who is usually seen carrying a doll and with her hair always in bunches. Adult-as-child is really unnerving and in this production, it adds a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassandra" target="_blank">Cassandra</a>-esque layer.</li>
<li>I admit it: at times I was perving. Holy hell, Cassius (Jenny Jules)&#8217;s abs are amazing.</li>
</ol>

<p>One problem for me was that as the action scaled up after Caesar&#8217;s assassination, I wasn&#8217;t sure what to do with the prison setting. Part of my brain was still trying to work out what significance the setting still had &#8211; for best enjoyment you just need to leave that behind and focus on with the plot, but my brain couldn&#8217;t quite do it. </p>
<p>The setting and the tale make an interesting mix, but they don&#8217;t fit perfectly throughout. <a title="Brick - movie on IMDB" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0393109/" target="_blank"><strong>Brick</strong></a> it ain&#8217;t. </p>
<p>Also, there was an interesting dissonance between the &#8216;honour&#8217; described (OK, makes sense) and the &#8216;love of Rome&#8217; which motivated Brutus and Cassius (but why do you love this place? It&#8217;s&#8230; prison.)</p>
<p>But if the <a title="Telegraph review" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/theatre-reviews/9746284/Julius-Caesar-at-Donmar-Warehouse-review.html" target="_blank">Torygraph</a> is <a title="Telegraph review" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/charlesmoore/9733633/I-fear-this-director-comes-to-bury-Caesar.html" target="_blank">spitting bullets</a> (twice) over the casting, you know you&#8217;re doing something right:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is a certain poetic justice that Lloyd’s effort should find itself in direct competition with the classy, respectful and hugely entertaining all-male versions of <strong>Twelfth Night</strong> and <strong>Richard III</strong>, which are running in rep at the Apollo. These productions would undoubtedly have met with Shakespeare’s approval.</p>
<p>&#8211; Tim Walker, <strong>Telegraph</strong> 14/12/12</p></blockquote>
<p>BUT WHAT ABOUT TEH MENS? </p>
<p>Dude, if you feel that threatened by affirmative action: there is <strong>everywhere else</strong> that you could go.</p>
<p>All in all this production is tough, gutsy and giving its all to sort out the <a title="Guardian Article on Under Representation of Women in Theatre" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/dec/10/theatre-england-women-underrepresented" target="_blank">massive under-representation</a> of women in theatre. </p>
<p>And the modern, unpretentious setting gives you a huge amount to think about &#8211; above and beyond the plot of an already dense play. It&#8217;s on until the 9th of February.</p>
