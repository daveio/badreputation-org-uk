					<description><![CDATA[That's right, folks: I'm talking about babies.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>For more about this series on Romance Novel Tropes, read <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/08/01/new-series-hopeless-reimantic/">Rei&#8217;s Hopeless Reimantic intro post</a> and <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/08/20/hopeless-reimantic-part-one-virginal-heroines/" target="_blank">Part 1: Virginal Heroines</a>.</em></p>
<p>(The author recognises that the phenomenon discussed below is not, in fact, limited to people who are married and in love. I&#8217;ll get to marriage in romance novels some other time.)</p>
<p>[<strong>TRIGGER WARNING:</strong> Discussion of infertility and failed pregnancies below.]</p>
<p>[<strong>SPOILER WARNING: </strong>This piece discusses happenings from the first and third episodes of the new season of <strong>Doctor Who</strong>, as well as containing mild spoilers for <strong>Game Of Thrones</strong>.]</p>
<p>Last time on <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/category/bookshelf/hopeless-reimantic-bookshelf/" target="_blank"><strong>Hopeless Reimantic</strong></a> we talked about virginal heroines, and while I wasn&#8217;t totally positive on the topic, I will give the virginal heroine this: at least most of the time, she doesn&#8217;t stay virginal throughout the book. That trope has an expiration date, if you will. This next one is actually significantly more irritating to me &#8211; partly, admittedly, because it&#8217;s outside my experience in a way that I have no particular interest in remedying, but mainly because even if I didn&#8217;t feel that way I still think I&#8217;d find the topic clumsily handled and often just shoehorned in to make the romance more&#8230;legitimate.</p>

Image by the illustrious Kate Beaton (http://www.harkavagrant.com), shirt by topatoco.</p></div>
<p>That&#8217;s right, folks: I&#8217;m talking about babies. Well, in brief. I suppose more accurately (and more vaguely) what I&#8217;m talking about is parenthood.</p>
<p>I suppose putting this column in second is kind of cheating, because it jumps to the end of the standard romance novel narrative &#8211; or, depending on how much edginess we&#8217;re going for, about three-quarters of the way through &#8211; and for that I apologise, but I promise you that the baby trope is all-pervasive enough that it&#8217;s not going  to matter. An Extremely Standard Romance Novel, you see, goes something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>[Play]boy meets [virgin] girl</li>
<li>They deny their attraction to one another for a while (usually this consists of Mr Man insisting that our heroine is Just Like All Other Women and although she makes his dick hard he could never actually love her, and our heroine protesting any kind of attraction to Mr Man at all)</li>
<li>Inevitably, sex.</li>
<li>A brief honeymoon period, usually compounded by more sex</li>
<li>Some kind of big misunderstanding that breaks them apart [at this point the heroine may or may not discover that she is pregnant]</li>
<li>Reunion. Marriage. BABIES.</li>
</ol>
<p>The story outlined above is common to a lot of romance novels (including our old friend from last time, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Bought-Destitute-Yet-Defiant-ebook/dp/B004NBZGGK/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1345324117&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank"><strong>Bought: Destitute Yet Defiant</strong></a>) but it is by no means the only sprog-imbued narrative out there in Romancelandia. Nor is it even the most baby-heavy. A quick search on <a href="http://dearauthor.com/" target="_blank">Dear Author</a> for &#8220;babies&#8221; turned up eight pages of hits and reminded me that Dear Author actually <a href="http://dearauthor.com/tag/secret-baby/" target="_blank">has a tag</a> for &#8220;secret baby&#8221; plotlines &#8211; yes, they exist, and they&#8217;re common enough that they get their own category on review sites. These stories might start out with two separated lovers meeting again after many years &#8211; but wait! She has a child! The fact that it&#8217;s <em>his</em> child is blindingly obvious throughout, but often only revealed at the very end! What could be more romantic?</p>
<p>A nicely infuriating example of this trope on my Kindle is a little tale called <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Emergency-Wife-Lost-Found-ebook/dp/B004NBZGFQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1348656852&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank"><strong>Emergency: Wife Lost and Found</strong></a> &#8211; a Mills&amp;Boon Medical Romance by Carol Marinelli that, to be fair, I have to admit was less awful upon revisitation than I remember it being the first time around. It&#8217;s a reunion tale between two doctors who met in medical school and married young because &#8211; shockingly &#8211; they got pregnant, but whose marriage then fell apart upon the loss of the baby.</p>

The loss of a child is a devastating one, and especially to a couple who married essentially because of the child (there are some token protests that it would have happened anyway because they were in Real True Love, but still) &#8211; I can only imagine the effects of that on their relationship. It&#8217;s no wonder they divorced, and believeable that their meeting again after so long would be fraught with emotional tension (and I don&#8217;t wanna go into the whole thing, but there&#8217;s a lot of emotional tension for their meeting to be fraught with). And it&#8217;s understandable that some of the tension between them also comes from Lorna, the heroine, having since discovered that due to <a href="http://www.endometriosis-uk.org/" target="_blank">endometriosis</a> she&#8217;s unlikely to carry another pregnancy to term. I would actually have been extremely interested in a book that <em>had</em> dealt with those issues &#8211; that explored the characters coming to term with Lorna&#8217;s infertility, and how that might have changed or strengthened their relationship.</p>
<p>The thing is, the book doesn&#8217;t actually deal with any of those issues. It skates over them briefly, and then True Love Sex happens, and Lorna&#8230;gets pregnant. Magically. And by the book&#8217;s epilogue, she has another child on the way, and her happiness is complete. See, true love fixed her!</p>
<p>Secret babies and miracle pregnancies are not limited to contemporary romance fiction, either, although it&#8217;s only here that the total absence (or extremely brief, give-it-one-sentence-and-handwave-it-away mentions of) abortion, adoption (either way!) and foster care are so totally and thoroughly angering. Historicals often feature a heroine whose dark secret is that, for whatever reason, she thinks she can&#8217;t have children but then, inexplicably, has at least one child by the end of the book; the widow whose husband never gave her children, but who then meets the hero and gets pregnant so fast you&#8217;d think they had some sort of corresponding velcro arrangement, is a particularly common one. Because that is the miracle that true love can provide.</p>
<p>True love also, incidentally, provides the incentive for wanting the kids in the first place in roughly half of these cases &#8211; there are quite a lot of cases of heroines (and heroes, to be fair) for whom a family was always endgame, but also a depressing number of heroines who get pregnant, having never wanted or thought about children before, and are midway through a totally justified freakout when they realise that the baby must be Mr Man&#8217;s and melt into a puddle of warm, maternal goo and aren&#8217;t scared anymore. And don&#8217;t get me started on the reaction some heroes have to this. I distinctly remember a book I read a few months ago &#8211; it was called <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Momentary-Marriage-ebook/dp/B008OJ8AEC/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1348657105&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank"><strong>Momentary Marriage</strong></a>, one of those &#8220;we&#8217;ll just marry for a year or so to help us both out of a jam that could totally not be solved any other way!&#8221; storylines &#8211; and the hero of our tale not only makes plans to impregnate the heroine without her knowledge so that she&#8217;ll stay with him, but spends about half a page getting turned on at the idea. If art does imitate life, there are a lot more pregnancy fetishists out there than you&#8217;d expect. All I&#8217;m sayin&#8217;.</p>
<p>The thing is, while this trope may be extremely common in romance novels &#8211; overwhelmingly, nauseatingly common, even &#8211; it isn&#8217;t confined to them. Remember <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_of_the_Daleks" target="_blank"><strong>Asylum of the Daleks</strong></a>, the first episode of the new season of <strong>Doctor Who</strong>? That one that came out a few weeks ago? Remember Rory and Amy&#8217;s Fifty Seconds Of Conflict, when he shouts at her for leaving him and her response is WELL YOU WANTED CHILDREN AND I CAN&#8217;T HAVE THEM, SO I GAVE YOU UP RATHER THAN ACTUALLY TRY TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS? Yeah. Because in the UK in 2012, apparently adoption doesn&#8217;t exist, and neither does speaking to your partner. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Town_Called_Mercy" target="_blank">Later on</a> in the series we have Mad Scientist Alien, who looks at Amy and can immediately tell that she&#8217;s had children because she is sad and fierce and caring, as if motherhood is the only experience that could confer these characteristics. Genre-hopping a bit to <strong>Game of Thrones</strong>, we have Daenerys Targaryen, who becomes a mother to her people because she&#8217;s never going to have children who aren&#8217;t dragons. (Which I personally don&#8217;t see the problem with. I would <em>much</em> rather have dragon-babies than baby-babies, although I suppose feeding them would be something of a negotiation.) And these are just the examples I can think of off the top of my head.</p>
<p>I appreciate that a lot of people do want children. I appreciate that some would even go so far as to say that their children are the best things in their lives, and that is valid and legitimate and completely worthy of representation in fiction. In spite of all that, though,  as you may be able to tell, I have extremely little patience with this trope, and I&#8217;m going to try and explain why without sputtering too incoherently. Bear with me a moment.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>First of all, I have a huge problem with motherhood being portrayed as the only really worthwhile thing a woman can aspire to. Motherhood is worthwhile, and it is important, and it deserves to be venerated and respected. But I object to the idea that it is the <em>only</em> thing that is worthwhile and important and worthy of veneration and respect. This elevation to the exclusion of all other things is not, as I&#8217;m not the first person to point out, extended to fatherhood, either &#8211; a man who never has children may well have been doing other, equally important, things, whereas a woman who&#8217;s never had children is often seen as an object of either pity or scorn. </p>
<p>So far, it seems that the only wish-fulfilment medium aimed specifically at women overwhelmingly portrays babies as the reward a good woman gets for being a good person and a good lover and without which no other goodness is really, truly good. Where does that leave women who have real-life style infertility &#8211; the kind that isn&#8217;t fixed by falling in lasting love &#8211; or those who just never had that wish in the first place?</p>
<p>And that brings me to my next point. I&#8217;d like everyone to bear in mind, by the way, that I say this next part as a person who doesn&#8217;t actually <em>like</em> children that much. I&#8217;ve definitely mellowed towards them as I&#8217;ve grown older &#8211; meeting some actually nice ones that I wasn&#8217;t forced to hang out with because I was presenting female at the time has helped &#8211; but I&#8217;m not a particular fan. They&#8217;re okay; I might want my own someday, but right now I&#8217;m leaning towards not. (That&#8217;s right, Friend Of My Friend&#8217;s Family Who Wrote Me That Poem About How Not Having Kids Is A Waste Of My Genes Five Years Ago<sup><a href="/2012/09/26/hopeless-reimantic-2-that-thing-that-comes-after-love-and-marriage/#footnote_0_12444" id="identifier_0_12444" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" True freaking story. ">1</a></sup> &#8211; the answer&#8217;s still no.)</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s review, shall we? So far this segment we&#8217;ve talked about pregnancy, secret pregnancy, miracle pregnancy, infertility, abortion, adoption and the concept of motherhood.</p>
<p>What have we not &#8211; really &#8211; talked about?</p>
<p>Any actual babies.</p>
<p>I do understand that it can be difficult to write about the children in child-plotlines themselves, especially if the story in question is actually supposed to be focused on relationships between adults. But there&#8217;s a pretty big difference between &#8220;this character is important but doesn&#8217;t really do much beyond eat and cry and poop, so I can&#8217;t write too much about them&#8221; and &#8220;we need something important in this story! What&#8217;s important to women? BABIES! Let&#8217;s put some babies in here&#8221;. </p>
<p>I suppose my overwhelming thought is that if it&#8217;s so difficult to write about pregnancies or children in a well-rounded way that makes them more than plot devices (or Plot Moppets, as the good folk over at Smart Bitches refer to them) writers should maybe think more carefully about including a pregnancy storyline, and how to treat it if they do decide to put one in (as, er, it were). Babies are the tiny humans that shape the future of our world. They deserve more respect than that.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it for today! Next time on Hopeless Reimantic&#8230;either marriage or playboy heroes, I haven&#8217;t decided yet.</p>
<p>See you then!</p>

<p>Have you ever looked at superheroines today and thought &#8220;Hmmm&#8230; they could be a bit more comfy.&#8221; All that spandex and those costumes with holes cut out, don&#8217;t they ever get cold? Don&#8217;t they ever just want to put their slippers on and relax?</p>
<p>Well, artist <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/OniYon?ref=seller_info"><strong>Hanie Mohd</strong></a> must have thought the same thing, because she&#8217;s got a whole series of prints on Etsy featuring super girls in sweaters, and they&#8217;re super cute, too! She&#8217;s got Power Girl, Catwoman, Oracle, Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, Rogue from the X-Men and Stephanie Brown&#8217;s Batgirl. I wonder who she&#8217;ll draw next?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/88733783/power-girl-in-a-sweater-art-print"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/il_570xN.296256866-215x300.jpg?resize=155%2C216" alt="Power Girl wears her usual white costume, but it looks a lot moire comfy and sweater-like than usual." width="155" height="216" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>I&#8217;ve bought the <a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/88011255/catwoman-in-a-sweater-art-print">Catwoman print</a>, and after all the hullabaloo about how much Catwoman was or wasn&#8217;t wearing in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_52">DC52</a>, there&#8217;s something that&#8217;s quite comforting about seeing Selina in a kitty sweater. Doesn&#8217;t she just look so happy to be wearing it?</p>
<h2>The SFX Weekender</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.sfxweekender.com/"><strong>SFX Weekender</strong></a> is an annual sci-fi convention run by <a href="http://www.sfx.co.uk/"><strong>SFX Magazine</strong></a>; it took place in Rye in the south of England in 2010 and 2011, and this year it&#8217;s based in Wales at Prestatyn Sands, from the 2nd to the 5th of February. There are events for those who love comics, gaming, SF movies and books, and unlike what might be thought of as a &#8216;typical&#8217; sci-fi convention<a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/10/20/awesomewatch-or-things-which-are-awesome-right-now-by-jenni-aged-24-34/"></a> there are always loads of women there enjoying the show.</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/weekender_redux25-600x489.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/weekender_redux25-600x489-300x244.jpg?resize=240%2C195" alt="the glowing blue banner logo for the sfx weekender" width="240" height="195" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>I&#8217;ve been before, and I&#8217;m going again, this year they&#8217;ve got stellar guests such as Alex Kingston, who plays River Song in <strong>Doctor Who</strong>, and Eve Myles who plays Gwen in <strong>Torchwood</strong>. There&#8217;s also Hattie Hayridge, the standup comedienne who plays Holly in <strong>Red Dwarf</strong> and Sophie Aldred, who used to play the Doctor&#8217;s companion, Ace, in <strong>Doctor Who</strong> in the 1980s. There&#8217;ll be some great scifi and fantasy authors there too, from fantasy authors Juliet McKenna (who wrote <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/08/15/the-representation-of-women-in-fantasy-what%E2%80%99s-the-problem-a-guest-post-by-author-juliet-e-mckenna/">this great post</a> for us on the representation of women in fantasy last year) and Mark Charan Newton, comics authors such as Paul Cornell and Dan Abnett, to sci-fi authors Jaine Fenn, Michael Cobley and China Miéville.</p>
<p>There are always great booths and an equally great programme of panel discussions, writing workshops, quizzes, and cosplay competitions, awards ceremonies such as the <a href="http://awards2012.sfx.co.uk/">SFX Awards</a> and <a href="http://www.thekitschies.com/">the Kitschies</a>, and a &#8216;Maskerade&#8217; party on the final night (DJed by <strong>Red Dwarf</strong>&#8216;s Craig Charles). All best enjoyed with some cold beer and some good geeky friends, of course.</p>
<h2>Sci-Fi Stage Adaptations</h2>
<p>Did you know <strong>The Ballad of Halo Jones</strong> had been adapted into a play? No, neither did I, but the Alan Moore story that&#8217;s been named as one of feminist website <a href="http://www.thefword.org.uk/shop/">The F Word&#8217;s recommended</a> comics and graphic novels was perfomed by Manchester-based production company <a href="http://scytheplays.blogspot.com/">Scytheplays</a> in early January.</p>
<p>We heard about this production via <a href="http://edfortune.wordpress.com/2012/01/02/the-ballad-of-halo-jones-the-stage-play/">this glowing review from Ed Fortune</a>. </p>
<blockquote><p>Halo and her friends live on the Hoop &#8211; a repository for the unemployed in the 50th century, but she won’t be beaten. She dreams of getting out and becomes a legend in the process.</p></blockquote>
<p>The current run is over now, but maybe they can be persuaded to go on tour? Comics writer Maura McHugh mentions her love of Halo Jones in an interview with BadRep <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/05/25/roisin-dubh-demons-and-bicycles-an-interview-with-author-maura-mchugh-part-one/">here.</a></p>
<p>We also found out recently that Cory Doctorow&#8217;s <a href="http://craphound.com/littlebrother/download/">revolutionary YA novel <strong>Little Brother</strong></a> has been adapted for the stage by <a href="http://www.custommade.org/">The Custom Made Theatre Co.</a>, though sadly this theatre happens to be in San Francisco, America, so I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve much chance of seeing that one&#8230;</p>
<p>Do you know of any other SF stage adaptations going on at the moment? Share them in the comments or <a href="mailto:badrepeditors@gmail.com">send them to the usual BadRep editors address!</a></p>

					<description><![CDATA[There's more to life than X Factor. Choose Who.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Doctor Who </strong> returns this Saturday for the second part of the sixth series it has enjoyed since re-launching in 2005. It&#8217;s a television programme that has inspired many &#8211; kids and adults alike &#8211; to a great deal of hoping, dreaming and far far greater fandom than they ever thought possible. It&#8217;s a show that escapes reality yet deals with the fantastic in a way that we can all relate to. And, yes, we&#8217;ve always liked it because of the crappy monsters and special effects. Whether or not you are a fan of the Doctor, you may now be wondering why he deserves a mention here. Well, let me tell you this&#8230;. I think that <strong>Doctor Who </strong>is very much a feminist show.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Doctor_Who_2010_title.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="7050" data-permalink="/2011/08/24/guest-post-doctor-who-feminist-icon/doctor_who_2010_title/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Doctor_Who_2010_title.jpg?fit=400%2C225&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="400,225" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Doctor_Who_2010_title" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Doctor_Who_2010_title.jpg?fit=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Doctor_Who_2010_title.jpg?fit=400%2C225&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7050" title="Doctor_Who_2010_title" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Doctor_Who_2010_title-300x168.jpg?resize=300%2C168" alt="Dr Who series 5 title card - on a cloudy orange background the show's title is picked out in metallic-look sci-fi style lettering. In the centre of the screen the letters DW are styled and perspectived to look like the box-shape of the Doctor's ship, the TARDIS. Image via Wikipedia, shared under Creative Commons" width="300" height="168" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Doctor_Who_2010_title.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Doctor_Who_2010_title.jpg?w=400&amp;ssl=1 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Although the Doctor has, so far, always been male and his companions are most often female, the gender of these characters are somewhat irrelevant when it comes to Getting Things Done. The Doctor is no James Bond or Indiana Jones. He uses intellect, banter and good old-fashioned running away rather than weapons, strength or bravado. In addition, there is nothing to say that regeneration could not leave our Time Lord resembling a human female in the future. This did happen when Joanna Lumley <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/joannalumley.jpg">briefly</a> played the part for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_and_the_Curse_of_Fatal_Death">Comic Relief spoof</a> in 1999, and there is often speculation about which female actor would be best to play the part.</p>
<p>Having relatively little knowledge of the many original series of <strong>Doctor Who</strong>, due to my poor memory and loss of interest around the Colin Baker era, I thought I&#8217;d ask a dedicated fan for a second opinion on this theory. Nick from book blog <a href="http://leaf-pile.blogspot.com/">A Pile of Leaves</a> agreed that I was right about the irrelevant gender of the characters. &#8220;Often the Doctor is a paternal or pedagogic figure, but he’s also depicted as fallible, flaky, eccentric, irascible. The first Doctor was told off quite a bit by his stern schoolteacher companion Barbara, the second Doctor was never as clever as astrophysicist Zoe, and the Fourth went around with a Time Lady for a while who was constantly correcting him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Doctor is simply a person, albeit an alien one, and so many of the usual tropes just won&#8217;t work here. He&#8217;s not &#8216;all knowing&#8217;, although he does a very good impression of that most of the time, and quite frequently he doesn&#8217;t have a plan. Most adventure stories have a hero who will always stay and fight, but the Doctor knows all too well when it&#8217;s time to simply give up and run away. Unlike most shows with a male and a female lead, none of the Doctors and companions have really had a romantic relationship until <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_Tyler">Rose Tyler</a>, somewhat controversially, declared her love for David Tennant&#8217;s Doctor. The companions are usually just someone to hang around with, adding an extra layer of excitement and preventing the boredom of travelling alone. Occasionally they know a fair bit more than he does too.</p>

When the character joined the show in 1973 she was added to give a topical splash of &#8216;Women&#8217;s Lib&#8217;, but it took a while for the writers to get the hang of exactly how best to do this. With the help of the actress who played her, the late <a href="http://io9.com/5793664/rip-elisabeth-sladen-doctor-whos-apprentice">Elisabeth Sladen</a>, in Tom Baker&#8217;s second series as the Doctor Sarah-Jane became a strong, independent character who often worked things out for herself. The writers started to give her some of the lines that had been written for the Doctor and she became more of an equal partner to him, staying on the show for longer than most companions and also returning in 2006 for another adventure. Only the best companions get their own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sarah_Jane_Adventures">spin-off show</a>, right?</p>
<p>Another excellent character who failed to conform to the annoyingly useless stereotype was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_(Doctor_Who)"><strong>Ace</strong></a>. Appearing right at the end of the original stretch of Doctor Who series in the 1980s, Ace, played by Sophie Aldred, had already learned to fend for herself on an alien planet before the Doctor even arrived and was far more tough than<a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/ace.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="7056" data-permalink="/2011/08/24/guest-post-doctor-who-feminist-icon/ace/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/ace.jpg?fit=274%2C380&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="274,380" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="ace" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/ace.jpg?fit=216%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/ace.jpg?fit=274%2C380&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-7056 alignright" title="ace" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/ace-216x300.jpg?resize=216%2C300" alt="Ace: a young caucasian woman wearing a black bomber jacket covered in patches and badges. She is sitting in front of trees with her knee drawn up against her chest and is wearing black and red patterned tights.

She battled the Daleks and the Cybermen, gaining confidence during her time in the TARDIS much like the brash Rose Tyler. These days, however, confidence is definitely not something that is lacking when it comes to female characters on the show. Since her arrival in 2010, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Pond"><strong>Amy Pond</strong></a> has always been stubborn, determined and rarely doubts her own abilities. Karen Gillan, who plays her, may have dismissed the idea that <a href="http://www.metro.co.uk/tv/831016-doctor-whos-karen-gillan-slams-sexy-amy-pond-critics">Amy is a feminist character</a>, but she most certainly has the ability to kick the patriarchy squarely in the balls. In contrast, her love-interest Rory is a caring and loyal nurse.</p>
<p>For anyone who likes their action-adventure stories to have a proper ballsy action hero, Doctor Who does now have one of those too. Of course, with this being Who, the character is no Jason Bourne. She was introduced in 2008 as a fearless professor and, due to also being a time traveller, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Song_(Doctor_Who)"><strong>River Song</strong></a> (Alex Kingston) not only knew the Doctor but had travelled with a future version of him, which meant that she now knew more than he did! River has seen and done enough to have a pretty good idea how to get out of most situations, and unlike the Doctor, she has no objection to using weapons to get her own way. Most definitely someone I would like to be around to help me out of trouble, but then again, so is the Doctor.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying that the programme fulfills every feminist want and need, as it&#8217;s still chock full of cliches and stereotypes in places, but this is a story where the parts could theoretically be played by anyone. River Song could be Nathan Fillion and the Doctor could be Helena Bonham Carter. How great would that be? In a Saturday night television schedule where little girls are shown that singing well and looking pretty can make you a star, isn&#8217;t it nice that they also have a show to watch where a gang of intergalactic misfits can win via the strategic application of a bit of thinking? There&#8217;s more to life than X Factor. Choose Who.</p>
