										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my ongoing quest for image-and-word combinations with female characters that aren&#8217;t made of boobs in jumpsuits, I&#8217;ve been doing some trawling of the internet for webcomics for your edu-tainment. Here&#8217;s some of the best of them.</p>
<h3>Strong Female Protagonist</h3>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Strong-Female-Protagonist.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="13972" data-permalink="/2013/09/23/webcomics-to-watch-out-for-part-one/strong-female-protagonist/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Strong-Female-Protagonist.jpg?fit=684%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="684,1024" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Strong Female Protagonist" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Strong-Female-Protagonist.jpg?fit=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Strong-Female-Protagonist.jpg?fit=684%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-13972" alt="A black and white panelled comic with thick drawn line art and grey shading. A ground level image of a pair of feet in trainers walk past an angry crowd who are hurling abuse. A teenage girl in shorts and tshirt holds aloft a man in an overcoat and gasmask, demanding to know if the crowd know who he is. When they do not answer, she picks up a car and throws it. A huge, angry text bubble with NOW! appears by the wreckage." src="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Strong-Female-Protagonist-200x300.jpg?resize=200%2C300" width="200" height="300" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Strong-Female-Protagonist.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Strong-Female-Protagonist.jpg?w=684&amp;ssl=1 684w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> Yes, I found this by doing a lazy Google search after &#8220;decent webcomics that won&#8217;t make me scream&#8221; didn&#8217;t turn up anything useful. But it worked, and here we are. <a href="http://strongfemaleprotagonist.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Strong Female Protagonist</strong></a> by Brennan Lee Mulligan (writer) and <a href="http://www.mollyostertag.com/" target="_blank">Molly Ostertag</a> (art) is a superheroine comic about an American teenager trying to deal with being an ex-superhero, her former comrades and enemies, and going to university whilst still having epic superpowers.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s an X-Men-esque backdrop of mutation-hatred, and so she exists, like many superheroes, in a world that is not entirely happy about <em>having</em> superheroes. The black and white thick line art is really nice, I like the emphasis on characters&#8217; faces and expressions rather than bodies, and the themes of power, responsibility and morality are something I think the &#8220;super&#8221; genre is well-placed to tackle.</p>
<p>The main exploration is, naturally enough, about what it means to be a Strong Female Protagonist, and links neatly to <a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2013/08/i-hate-strong-female-characters" target="_blank">this nice article on the subject in the New Statesman recently</a>. Yes, the lead character is &#8220;strong&#8221; &#8211; she&#8217;s a physical powerhouse, and strong-minded too. Her strength isn&#8217;t just physical, but also emerges in terms of her blunt decision-making and clearly held beliefs about right and wrong. Strength ostensibly defines her, but the comic is about the questions and complications behind what that might mean.</p>
<h3>Delilah Dirk</h3>
<p>I was absolutely bowled over by the quality of the artwork in <a href="http://www.delilahdirk.com" target="_blank"><strong>Delilah Dirk and the Turkish Lieutenant</strong></a>. The colouration is superb, and the detail in each of the panels makes the whole thing look absolutely lush: there&#8217;s a &#8220;classic story&#8221; feel to the whole piece, and the pages, like our titular heroine, are full of life and activity.</p>
<p>The comic is set in (sort of) Constantinople in 1805, and is very much in the style of <strong>The Mummy</strong> and <strong>Adele Blanc-Sec</strong> (watch the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Extraordinary_Adventures_of_Ad%C3%A8le_Blanc-Sec_(film)" target="_blank">movie</a> now, if you haven&#8217;t). I won&#8217;t lie, I do like a good swashbuckling, wisecracking character in a gung-ho Sinbad the Sailor-style universe, where bad guys are bad and the goodies might do slightly naughty things, but it&#8217;s all in a Robin Hood sort of way.</p>
<p>This is one of those narratives: Delilah is half English, half Greek, all Action Famous Adventure Lady, and all tongues should remain in cheeks, except when they&#8217;re lolling at the beautiful landscapes of <a href="http://www.tonycliff.com/" target="_blank">Tony Cliff</a>, whose work has also graced <strong><a href="http://www.flightcomics.com/" target="_blank">Flight</a></strong>. It&#8217;s not particularly deep or meaningful, but hey, not all narratives with female characters need to be about what it is to be a female character, right? It&#8217;s definitely a damn good yarn, and worth a look for the art if nothing else.</p>
<h3>The Fox Sister</h3>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Fox-Sister-33.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="13971" data-permalink="/2013/09/23/webcomics-to-watch-out-for-part-one/foxsister_ch1_interior_redeux-indd/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Fox-Sister-33.jpg?fit=600%2C783&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="600,783" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;foxsister_ch1_interior_redeux.indd&quot;}" data-image-title="foxsister_ch1_interior_redeux.indd" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Fox-Sister-33.jpg?fit=229%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Fox-Sister-33.jpg?fit=600%2C783&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-13971 alignleft" alt="A four panel vertical comic. A woman in an overcoat steps into a darkened alleyway, the sun setting above her. The shadows darken and lengthen. After a moment, a many tailed fox with gleaming red eyes pads out of the bottom panel towards the reader." src="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Fox-Sister-33-229x300.jpg?resize=229%2C300" width="229" height="300" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Fox-Sister-33.jpg?resize=229%2C300&amp;ssl=1 229w, https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Fox-Sister-33.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w" sizes="(max-width: 229px) 100vw, 229px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>A fox-spirit comic? I don&#8217;t mind if I do.</p>
<p>Rather than the more familiar Japanese shapeshifter, <a href="http://www.thefoxsister.com/" target="_blank"><strong>The Fox Sister</strong></a> is about the Korean <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumiho" target="_blank">Kumiho</a>. It&#8217;s another gorgeously-drawn webcomic and the product of a very welcome collaboration between <a href="http://chirart.deviantart.com/" target="_blank">Jayd Aït-Kaci </a>and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina_Strain" target="_blank">Christina Strain</a>, who is departing from her usual colourist work to write this modern fairytale of two sisters.</p>
<p>The thick line-brush work and open panels sit well with the thoughtful, slow-paced writing in a landscape of snow and secrets. I love the way the fox spirit steps out of the panel on the page I&#8217;ve included here.</p>
<p>Something about the artwork reminds me of a pre-Blu-ray cleanup <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055254/" target="_blank">Disney&#8217;s <strong>101 Dalmations</strong></a>, especially in the colour palette and faces of characters, but this is not a Disney story, though the elements make it appear like it might be &#8211; we have an all-American hero, and his ongoing terrible attempts at both speaking Korean and trying to get romantic with our heroine, Yun Mee, who is far more interested in fighting the fox-demon that took over her elder sister&#8217;s life.</p>
<h3>Gunnerkrigg Court</h3>
<p>A mysterious school, in a mysterious city, by a mysterious forest, separated by a large (mysterious) moat. This is a webcomic of teenagers, demons, spirits, folktales, ghosts, robots and the usual school-related growing pains. <a href="http://www.gunnerkrigg.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Gunnerkrigg Court</strong></a> is <strong>Harry Potter</strong> meets <strong>Malory Towers</strong> meets something deeper and darker altogether.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a huge, sprawling world, crammed full of interesting female characters. The story focuses on the central pair of Antimony and Katriona, who are best friends, and their experiences going to school and becoming part of a magical/technological war which is threatening to move from cold to hot.</p>
<p>The comic is subtle, curious, funny and strange, with tones of <a href="http://www.serenavalentino.com/projects/gloomcookie/" target="_blank"><strong>Gloom Cookie</strong></a>, although the art is cleaner and more colourful; slightly French and manga-esque in feel. I particularly like the fact that the world has rules that are revealed as you go along, and how many things (and people) are left unexplained and without immediate resolution. Relationships are equally complicated &#8211; this is a world where love and feelings are explored in detail.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all for the moment &#8211; more in the next post. Please share any webcomics you find with the team here, as we&#8217;re always looking for more reading material. For bonus points, here&#8217;s a link from the <a href="http://www.themarysue.com" target="_blank">Mary Sue</a> on Gail Simone&#8217;s griping about <a href="http://themarysue.tumblr.com/post/58248295528/gailsimone-claysad-gail-simones-twitter" target="_blank">writing those troublesome male characters</a>. Because it made me laugh this afternoon.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Like most of the Disney Renaissance heroines, hers is the story of a successful transition from the rule of the father to the rule of the husband. But how did we get to something so squeaky-clean? ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li><em><strong>Ed&#8217;s Note:</strong> This post is partly in honour of <a href="http://poemsunderwater.wordpress.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Poems Underwater</strong></a>, a new project on the symbolism of the mermaid our Hodge is involved with, which you are hereby urged to check out (and perhaps <a href="http://poemsunderwater.wordpress.com/contribute/" target="_blank">contribute</a> to, as it has a zine and everything!).</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Released in 1989, Disney’s <strong>The Little Mermaid</strong> heralded the start of the ‘Disney Renaissance’ – a period of critical and commercial success that followed a rocky patch where the studio’s prime focus had been on Disneyland attractions rather than feature films.</p>
<p>It was soundtracked by <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/beauty-and-the-plague" target="_blank">Broadway golden boy Howard Ashman</a>, who changed the planned English butler crab into a Jamaican crustacean named Sebastian, and reworked the film’s structure to more closely align with that of a Broadway musical. He also decided to base Ursula the Sea Witch on drag artist and disco star <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_(performer)" target="_blank">Divine</a> (who died whilst the film was still in production).</p>
<p>Ashman died of AIDS two years later, in March 1991, but his musical influence, first on <b>Mermaid</b>, and subsequently on <strong>Beauty and the Beast</strong> and <strong>Aladdin</strong>, was a major factor in the regeneration of the studio in the early nineties. <strong>Mermaid</strong> won Oscar gongs for Best Song and Best Score, the first Oscar nod for Disney since the Seventies.</p>
<h2>Mermaids of the Eighties</h2>

<p>The Disney studio had been considering Hans Christian Andersen’s <b>The Little Mermaid </b>for adaptation as early as the <strong>Snow White</strong> years, but it was not until the late Eighties that the time finally seemed right. Even then, there was concern it might too closely duplicate <b>Splash</b>, which Disney had produced in 1984.</p>
<p><strong>Splash</strong> itself had been rushed through production because there were rumours of another mermaid film in the pipeline elsewhere – a Warren Beatty vehicle that eventually fell through. Why exactly mermaids were suddenly in the ascendant during this particular period of the late twentieth century is open to speculation; at any rate, the nudity and adult content in <strong>Splash</strong> led directly to the creation of Touchstone Pictures, Disney’s ‘older audiences’ label. Mermaids (particularly Darryl Hannah&#8217;s mermaid) were too sexual for the family studio in 1984.</p>
<p>Ironically, of course, <em>mermaid</em> &#8211; “maiden of the sea” – suggests that these aquatic women are rather more virginal than ‘Touchstone Pictures’ thought. Traditional (cisnormative) misogynistic popular wisdom holds women in general to be ‘leaky vessels’, because of the amount of ‘moisture’ they produce, but though mermaids live in the water, they have no apparent human genitalia, making them, by contrast, vessels that are rather neatly sealed.</p>
<p>In this, they link with the Virgin Mary, who appears in Catholic symbolism as a ‘fountain forever sealed’ in the middle of an enclosed garden, representing the Immaculate Conception. Mary’s homonymic (and virginal) association with mermaids, and the link between the sea (<em>mer</em>) and the mother (<em>mere</em>) introduces an additional layer to this.</p>
<p>Alongside this, there is also a parallel virgin/whore tradition of the mermaid as prostitute and even embodied vagina (since, famously, vaginas are often described as smelling like fish).</p>

<p>This opposing strand presumably comes from sailors’ fear of the Siren-figure and the unknowns out in the sea, but it’s also connected with a different type of mermaid altogether – the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/patia/2610080360/" target="_blank">melusine</a>. A double-tailed half-woman, half-fish, her intrinsic, though hidden, fishiness only emerges when she takes a bath. Even then, the double tail leaves her human genitalia open to the world in what <a href="http://www.endicott-studio.com/jMA03Summer/theMermaid.html">some have claimed</a> is an appropriation of older symbols of female fertility, such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheela_na_gig">Sheela na gig</a> or even the goddess Venus (an alternative ‘mother’ connection).</p>
<p>Incidentally the melusine, not the mermaid, is the figure in the (now closely cropped) logo for Starbucks coffee, the first branch of which opened &#8211; logo blazing proud, bare-breasted and double-tailed &#8211; in 1971, a decade before <strong>Splash</strong> went into production.</p>
<p>The coffee-shop melusine was maintained in her full glory until 1987 (although she was &#8216;sealed&#8217; at the point where the tails meet, <a href="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3129/2610080360_b4d8ba0e2d.jpg" target="_blank">as her original had not been</a>); the first of several censoring crops came into effect around the time Disney bosses turned their attention to Andersen.</p>
<p>For a modern contrast to the &#8216;sealed off&#8217; melusine, have a look at one of the <a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/lynxmermaid3.jpg" target="_blank">mermaids commissioned by men&#8217;s deodorant brand Lynx for an early Noughties advertising campaign</a>, whose posterior is beginning to resurface through her scales, soft porn-like.</p>
<h2>Planning The Little Mermaid</h2>
<p>Hans Christian Andersen’s original <strong>Little Mermaid</strong> tale was serviceable, but – much like Starbucks’ logo – it had to be sanitised before Disney could take it to a Disney audience. Tellingly, the changes proposed during this period of pre-production were substantially same as the ones suggested during the preliminary work in the Thirties.</p>

<p>The first thing to do was give it a happy ending, since in Andersen’s version the Prince’s indifference to the mermaid <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/05/09/fairy-tale-fest-the-best-adaptation-of-the-little-mermaid-ive-ever-seen/" target="_blank">results in her annihilation</a> and transformation to ‘a daughter of the air’.</p>
<p>This was typical Andersen: he wrote that ‘most of what I have written is a reflection of myself’, and he was not a terribly happy man. Unreciprocated love was an ongoing feature of his life, and throughout it he nursed passions for various inappropriate people.</p>
<p>These included celebrity soprano Jenny Lind (who is said to have inspired his story <strong>The Nightingale</strong> after she put him firmly in the friendzone in 1844) and various straight men, but he also wrote of avoiding actual sexual encounters – his diary records him visiting prostitutes, talking to them, and then returning home to masturbate alone.</p>
<p>Many of his ‘fairy tales’ are characterised by violence, speechlessness and unreciprocated love, often across two different ‘species’, as with the tin soldier’s love for a paper ballerina in <strong>The Steadfast Tin Soldier</strong>, or indeed the Little Mermaid’s love for the human Prince – a feature that tends to make them, like their author, rather sexless in approach.</p>
<p>Although the sad stuff was scrapped, the symbolically significant speechlessness of the Mermaid was maintained in the Disney screenplay. A mermaid’s voice is her primary power, since her singing can lure sailors to their deaths, so its loss is a significant one – aphonia in a milder form had also been a feature of <strong>Splash</strong>, where Darryl Hannah’s character cannot initially speak English.</p>
<p>Disney’s Ariel was voiced by Broadway star (and Ashman associate) Jodi Benson, and her voice remains her defining beauty in the film. But the manner of its loss changes: while both Little Mermaids give their voices up to the Sea Witch, in Andersen&#8217;s story the unnamed mermaid has her tongue cut out to bring this about. Disney cleaned this up, and, in the process, rendered it reversible: Ariel’s voice is depicted as a glowing, ghostly ball that can pass through bodily barriers without drawing blood – as in traditional artistic representations of the soul.</p>
<p>Ironically, this is exactly what Andersen’s mermaid is seeking: her love for the prince is the means through which she hopes to win ‘immortality’ and the chance to share in the joys of paradise. (This rather Romantic notion, albeit gender-inverted, links Andersen’s tale thematically with Friedrich de la Motte’s mermaid <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undine_(novella)" target="_blank"><strong>Undine</strong></a> &#8211; and also Tchaikovsky’s watery <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swan_Lake" target="_blank"><strong>Swan Lake</strong></a>, composed in 1875, the year Andersen died). Disney refocused the mermaid&#8217;s longing for a soul to a more secular – and sexualised – teenage quest for the love of a handsome prince.</p>
<h2>She sells sea shells</h2>
<p>But Disney hit a problem when it came to the artwork. Mermaids, of course, are typically bare-breasted, but so too were traditional depictions of Andersen’s ‘little’ mermaid, including the statue in Copenhagen’s harbour.</p>

<p>There is not a single illustration to the fairy tale pre-Disney that shows her wearing anything at all over her chest – in the case of Heath Robinson, <a href="http://sforsnail.blogspot.co.uk/2012/02/little-mermaid.html" target="_blank">this emphasises the ‘Little’ part</a>, as the mermaid is clearly a child in his illustrations.</p>

To make it completely clear, in the course of the film Ariel declares to her father (a familiar refrain) &#8216;I&#8217;m sixteen years old. I&#8217;m not a child.&#8217;</p>
<p>But however innocently naked (and animated) the Little Mermaid might be, Disney certainly could not show a sixteen year old’s breasts on screen. Their solution to this problem was the creation of a purple bra made out of shells &#8211; a new mermaid first.</p>
<p>When coupled with the waistband-like arrangement at the top of her tail (another innovation, since traditionally the mermaid’s scales segue gradually from the skin at her waist), this decision had the effect of creating a kind of mermaid bikini that implies she might just be wearing an elaborate two-piece – one very similar, in fact, to the <a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Jasmine.jpg" target="_blank">ensemble worn by Princess Jasmine</a> in Disney’s next film, <strong>Aladdin</strong>. And, of course, it also has the effect of emphasising breasts and hips either side of a tiny waist.</p>
<p>The Barbie-style Ariel doll I had as a child had (as modern-day packaging still asserts) &#8216;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Disney-Princess-Ariel-Doll---/dp/B003V02BOO/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1365004666&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=ariel+doll" target="_blank">removable clothes for costume change</a>&#8216;, so it was clear she was a two-legged being with an optional tail.</p>
<p>This has the effect of making the transition from mermaid to human much easier: in Andersen’s story, creating two legs out of one fish tail is exactly as vicious as you would expect it to be, and the draught the mermaid drinks to effect this causes the sensation of ‘a two-edged sword [passing] through her delicate body’ – so severe she passes out. Throughout her subsequent time on land, each foot she puts to the ground feels like ‘treading upon the points of needles or sharp knives’.</p>
<p>Bodily mutilation – indeed, mortification – is everywhere in Andersen&#8217;s story. After everyone is asleep, the mermaid goes to ‘sit on the broad marble steps [of the palace] for it eased her burning feet to bathe them in the cold sea-water’. Significantly &#8211; and somewhat bizarrely &#8211; such mutilation has been an ongoing problem for the Copenhagen representation of Andersen&#8217;s mermaid: the statue in the harbour has been blown up, decapitated (twice) and had its arm sawn off, in addition to many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Mermaid_(statue)#Vandalism" target="_blank">petty acts of vandalism</a> since its erection in 1913.</p>
<h2>Some liberation?</h2>
<p>By contrast with Andersen&#8217;s difficult transition, Ariel’s easy-on, easy-off fish tail and bikini bra combo not only ‘re-opens’ the traditional closed mermaid vessel, it also sexualises the teenage mermaid in a manner markedly different from anything in Andersen’s original (where the mermaid’s love is increased by knowledge of the prince’s good deeds, and her longing for a soul).</p>

<p>By censoring Ariel, Disney draws attention to her body and breasts, so she resembles a California surfer girl. The nakedness, which in earlier illustrations was straightforward and childlike, takes on an explicitly sexual edge (for more on this, have a look at this piece <a href="http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/rrMermaids.html" target="_blank">by Virginia Borges</a>).</p>
<p>The result is that Disney’s <strong>Little Mermaid</strong> becomes the straightforward tale of a sixteen-year-old struggling with her father for the right to explore her burgeoning sexuality and go out with a boy. And because she ultimately uses this right to make a good marriage (wearing <a href="http://disney-clipart.com/wedding/princesses/Wedding-Ariel-Eric-Bride-Groom.jpg" target="_blank">something strikingly similar</a> to <a href="http://www.blogcdn.com/royalwedding.aol.com/media/2011/03/princess-diana-wedding-dresses294.jpg" target="_blank">the dress worn by the equally speechless Princess Diana</a> at her 1981 marriage), Ariel makes good in the end and everyone is happy.</p>
<p>Like most of the Disney Renaissance heroines, hers is the story of a successful transition from the rule of the father to the rule of the husband.</p>
<h2>Other mermaids</h2>
<p>But it’s interesting that at the same time the producers were working on a heteronormative middle-class fantasy idea, their musical wunderkind Howard Ashman (despite dying of what, at the time, was popularly cast as a very non-family-friendly disease) was injecting some Broadway pizzazz into the soundtrack. This included the introduction of a deviantly-styled figure like Divine via the character of Ursula, the Sea Witch (though of course she is defeated, as does not happen in Andersen).</p>
<p>In fact, as the Disney Renaissance got going, the calibre of stars from distinctly non-Disney backgrounds increased: <strong>The Lion King</strong>, the Renaissance nadir, had major Broadway stars alongside A-list Hollywood stars, and the cast included black and Latino actors – something that had not even been considered back in the Forties (when Uncle Walt wanted some racial-caricature ‘Jim Crow’ figures in <strong>Dumbo</strong>, the crows were voiced by white men doing their best ‘black man’ impression instead). The staff list at the Disney studios was full of Jewish and homosexual figures like Ashman. Yet <strong>The Little Mermaid</strong> ushered in some of the most socially conservative films Disney produced. A strange duality.</p>

<p>I’ve set myself a pretty tough task here.  I’ve picked a film clip I find particularly memorable from my childhood, with a character who utters some immortal words that I’d like to use to pose you all a related question.  Jessica Rabbit.  She’s a pin-up, and a cartoon, and a key part of the film <strong>Who Framed Roger Rabbit?</strong>, from which the clip is taken.</p>
<p>For anyone who hasn’t seen the film before, this is the first time we (and Eddie &#8211; Bob Hoskins’ character) see Jessica, who we already know is married to the eponymous Roger (a cartoon rabbit). There’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Framed_Roger_Rabbit#Themes" target="_blank">a lot more to this film</a> that we first realise, as I discovered recently thanks to <a href="http://www.intransitionmag.org/archive_stories/streetcar_scandal.aspx">this article</a>, and it’s got me thinking about Jessica and her famous line &#8211; is there more to her too?</p>
<p><iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/XAnNvnViJpo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<blockquote><p>“I’m not bad&#8230; I’m just drawn that way.”</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s a line that I’ve always been fascinated by, even as a kid.  Jessica’s appearance never sat well with me: the dress, the heels, the boobs, waist, lips, eyes &#8211; everything was just designed for one reason.  That reason is summed up very simply with that line she delivers in Eddie’s office.  Were the film writers trying to draw attention to something?  She’s been made by men, for men &#8211; but she isn’t too happy about it.</p>
<p>Here’s your food-for-thought prompt: <em><strong>Is the character’s acknowledgement that she’s been made a certain way an important admission, or a clever distraction from her creators?</strong></em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>In 1937 Goebbels presented a birthday gift of 18 Mickey Mouse shorts to the Führer. [&#8230;Disney] and Hitler [&#8230;] shared an overall social vision. They dreamed of a dispersed post-urban society, with a population — kept in line by a strong domestic realm instilling a keen sense of blood loyalty and &#8220;family values&#8221; — that could be efficiently mobilized to serve either the military needs of the state or the labor needs of industry.</p>

<p>Everyone knows about Disney&#8217;s ongoing <a href="http://www.cracked.com/article_15677_the-9-most-racist-disney-characters.html">racism issues</a>, so to hear that Uncle Walt was an active member of the American Nazi Party during the Thirties may not come as much surprise. But there were pink triangles as well as yellow stars in 1930s Berlin, and I want to know why pretty much all of Disney&#8217;s villains seem designed to display some kind of sexual or gender deviance.</p>

<p>It starts with Pinocchio, and the Fox and the Cat. Probably best remembered for their song &#8216;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEQjgGMKqt8">An Actor&#8217;s Life for Me</a>&#8216;, it&#8217;s this pair of crooks that first lure young Pinocchio off the straight and narrow. And I mean that literally: they&#8217;re Theatre Folk, dapper, urbane and not a little camp. Their bodies are constantly intertwining, grotesque and chaotic. I&#8217;m with Matt Roth when he says they&#8217;re obviously coded as gay &#8211; one of the key minorities Hitler argued, in <strong>Mein Kampf</strong>, were threatening the health and morality of contemporary  European youth.</p>
<p>But this doesn&#8217;t end with the fall of Hitler; later Disney films work their way through a succession of sexually deviant or ambiguous villains. The first significant entrant is the terrifying <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maleficent" title="Wikipedia: Maleficent">Maleficent</a> in <strong>Sleeping Beauty</strong>(1959). Like <strong>Aladdin</strong>&#8216;s Jafar (1992), she is elegant and a bit camp, though fundamentally sexless (witness how unattracted Jafar is to Princess Jasmine, wanting her only for political gains). Maleficent inhabits a strange underworld where orgiastic parties are the norm, and, like so many of her villainous successors, she&#8217;s got no-one of her own, but still remains determined to thwart the monogamous, heterosexual union of the noble royals Princess Aurora and Prince Philip (whose name was chosen by Uncle Walt in the 50s, when our Prince Philip was still someone nostalgia-loving Anglophile Americans might feel dewy-eyed about).</p>

<p>Two years later, <strong>101 Dalmatians</strong>&#8216; Cruella De Vil continues the trend. She shares Maleficent&#8217;s ill will towards the heteronormative family sphere, and acts as a kind of child-snatching boogyman. Her hyper-femme fashion sense only throws her withered, sexless frame into relief, and unlike the blissful feminine home of her friend Anita &#8211; who has settled down and found a nice man to take care of, sorting out Roger&#8217;s chaotic life with a Woman&#8217;s Touch &#8211;  Cruella&#8217;s decadent mansion is completely falling apart, which we can probably assume also mirrors the state of her biological clock. Cruella&#8217;s flamboyant yet barren sexuality focuses itself instead on fetishising the traditional trappings of femininity, including fur coats made from the produce of wombs more fecund than her own &#8211; like Perdita, the sexy Dalmatian.</p>
<h3>Dragged Up</h3>
<p>In the 80s, long after Walt&#8217;s death, the intentional gender deviance of Disney&#8217;s villains becomes more blatant still: this time the Gays are even more obviously in drag, and they&#8217;re looking back to the golden <strong>Pinocchio</strong> age of seducing The Children away from their suburban homes: think of Ursula in <strong>The Little Mermaid </strong>(1989) and her contrast with the alpha male King Triton, his big beard, and the Barbie-style InnoDBl with her<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SEyW8eXESQk/TpPRCtPiisI/AAAAAAAAATo/brAhE0e1a9w/s1600/littlemermaid2.jpg"> Princess Diana hair</a>.</p>

<p>Ursula is overweight, flamboyant and dragged up; her tentacles, as my pal Matt Roth points out (you really must read <a href="http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC40folder/LionKing.html">this article</a>, seriously), only make her the more sexually ambiguous. Like Maleficent, she lives in an underground other-world, with a &#8216;garden&#8217; of corrupted young people now condemned to live half-lives as plant-like beings. Her stagey hyper-femininity presents her as a dangerous prospect for the heteronormative, cisnormative InnoDBl &#8211; whose <em>voice</em> she steals in order to seduce the also very straight Prince Eric.</p>
<p>Ursula is given a metaphorical kind of new life (after being conquered by, er, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDGrSgTKEuw&amp;t=3m8s">the erect prow of Prince Eric&#8217;s enormous ship</a>) in the figure of Hades in <strong>Hercules </strong>(1997). He&#8217;s pretty much an exact counterpart to Ursula, black tentacles and all. His cabaret-style song &#8216;My Town&#8217;, from the <strong>Hercules</strong> TV series, introduces the underworld as a kind of underground New York, with its king a flamboyant, gender-ambiguous leader revelling in its delights:</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting, of course, that because of the source-text, <strong>Hercules</strong> must of necessity espouse the Ancient Greek worldview that says the Underworld &#8211; and therefore Hades himself &#8211; is a crucial part of the order of things; unlike the shady worlds of Pleasure Island and The Theatre in Nazi-era <strong>Pinocchio</strong>, &#8216;New Hades&#8217;, and the queers and deviants that inhabit it is a potentially corrupting influence that can be tolerated, as long as it&#8217;s kept firmly in its place. It&#8217;s much the same theory as the &#8216;Circle of Life&#8217; proposed by Mufasa in <strong>The Lion King </strong>(1994) &#8211; the ghettoised handout-dependent hyenas and their liberal, childless and urbane overlord Scar are fine, as long as they&#8217;re kept in their own sphere (that is, the obscure Elephants&#8217; Graveyard). When they take over, the Pridelands fall into ruin and corruption.</p>

<h3>Hanging on</h3>
<div id="attachment_10879" style="width: 309px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/LeFou1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10879" data-attachment-id="10879" data-permalink="/2012/07/04/my-town-the-strange-sexuality-of-disneys-underworld/lefou-2/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/LeFou1.jpg?fit=299%2C164&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="299,164" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="LeFou" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/LeFou1.jpg?fit=299%2C164&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/LeFou1.jpg?fit=299%2C164&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-10879" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/LeFou1.jpg?resize=299%2C164" alt="Le Fou fawns on Gaston and constantly occupies his personal space" width="299" height="164" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-10879" class="wp-caption-text">Intertwined: the hyper-masculine Gaston and the fawning creature Le Fou</p></div>
<p>There are also a whole host of less significant characters throughout Disney&#8217;s oeuvre who are mostly made ridiculous by virtue of their sexual ambiguity and concomitant lack of personhood. First up is the rotund Le Fou in <strong>Beauty and the Beast</strong>, who fawns, much like the Cat on the Fox, on the hyper-male Gaston (who is in strange contrast to the uber-femme but dragged up Ursula, and seems suspiciously uninterested in the various females laid on for his consumption).</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s Chi Fu, the emperor&#8217;s advisor in <strong>Mulan</strong>. He is primarily ridiculed because he is camp and rather gender-ambiguous &#8211; he has bunny slippers and a woman&#8217;s scream &#8211; in what I&#8217;d suggest is a double-whammy of homophobia mixed with Orientalist racism, much like that currently directed against Asian-American basketball player Jeremy Lin (<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/feb/21/jeremy-lin-racism-asian-americans">&#8216;Some lucky lady in NYC is gonna feel a couple of inches of pain tonight</a>&#8216; was a tweet from Fox sports commentator Jason Witlock on Lin&#8217;s recent sporting triumph). Or, to put it in Disney&#8217;s own terms, how about the notorious Siamese Cats in <strong>Lady and the Tramp</strong>, whose own gender is confused to say the least?</p>
<h3>Miss Man</h3>
<div id="attachment_10880" style="width: 190px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/mulan1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10880" data-attachment-id="10880" data-permalink="/2012/07/04/my-town-the-strange-sexuality-of-disneys-underworld/mulan-2/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/mulan1.jpg?fit=180%2C255&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="180,255" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="mulan" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/mulan1.jpg?fit=180%2C255&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/mulan1.jpg?fit=180%2C255&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-10880" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/mulan1.jpg?resize=180%2C255" alt="When Mulan's hair is up, she's a man." width="180" height="255" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-10880" class="wp-caption-text">The only difference between male and female Mulan is a bit of grooming.</p></div>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting to compare these gender-fails with Chi Fu&#8217;s own filmic context &#8211; <strong>Mulan </strong>(1998), where the title character is herself cross-dressing. There are two direct references to drag in this film (strange, given that Disney doesn&#8217;t in general have much of Dreamworks&#8217; obsessive-compulsive need to shove in over-the-kids&#8217;-heads jokes for the parents). The only one in direct reference to Mulan is Mushu (Eddie Murphy)&#8217;s Hilarious Ebonics &#8211; &#8216;Miss Man had to take her little drag act on the road&#8217;.</p>
<p>Yet, unlike the true weirdos doing it for a sexual thrill (like Ursula), Mulan&#8217;s is a noble gender-variance, taken on for the sole purpose of rescuing her ailing father and (ultimately) preparing herself mentally for marriage, which is how the film ends; note too that she has to become male in order to truly triumph in the male sphere, and that once this has been accomplished she can return home to her father and marry the sexy shirtless man (as she was unable to do at the beginning of the story).</p>
<p>It is therefore in keeping that her methodology basically amounts to &#8216;hair down = female; hair up = male&#8217; &#8211; and no-one ever notices it&#8217;s all the same person, just with a different hairstyle (note <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3f2is11VL0&amp;t=1m19s">how shocked the Evil Shan Yu is when she dons her &#8216;disguise</a>&#8216;): her gender-switch is more of a &#8216;sign&#8217; to the audience indicating which social sphere she&#8217;s inhabiting than anything literally transformative. Interesting stuff here.</p>
<p>Hmm. So&#8230; From the Fox and the Cat to the villains of the 90s, Disney&#8217;s villains have represented a kind of &#8216;other&#8217; that is almost always couched in terms of gender or sexuality, representing a challenge, and a threat, to the heteronormative worldview of the heroes and heroines &#8211; which always conquers, of course. What&#8217;s disturbing is that it&#8217;s so oft-repeated it almost becomes the whole unspoken tenet on which Disney&#8217;s works are based. The fight of good vs. evil is not so much a battle of objective morality as of sexual identity and preference.</p>
<p>Oops.</p>

<p>Pixar&#8217;s first full length movie with a female protagonist is less than four months away from release. And, <a href="http://io9.com/5887598/watch-the-first-scene-from-pixars-brave-now">as io9 reported last week</a>, the first scene is now previewable:</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/JOmc2GzWtSE" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>I&#8217;m really excited. ENGAGE INITIAL BURBLE-O-METER:</p>
<h3>HURRAH!</h3>
<ul>
<li>I remain so, so pleased to see a Pixar movie from the point of view of a girl character. Without exception, the entire Pixar canon &#8211; which I&#8217;m a huge, boxset-toting, scene-quoting fan of, for the record &#8211; features male protagonists, and while <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessie_(Toy_Story)">Jessie</a>, <a href="http://pixar.wikia.com/Dory">Dory</a>, and <a href="http://pixar.wikia.com/Ellie_Fredricksen">Ellie</a> (who determines much of <strong>Up</strong>&#8216;s story even though it&#8217;s via her absence) are all fun and compelling sidekick or partner characters, I&#8217;ve been waiting for Pixar to place a female character centre-stage. And now, after over 20 years, we&#8217;ve got one in the shape of Princess Merida, headstrong Scottish medieval archery whizz. </li>
<li>Placing a female character centre-stage, of course, is not the be-all and end-all. Disney&#8217;s been doing it for years with their fairytale movies and resultant &#8220;princess&#8221; brand. They&#8217;ve finally brought the curtain down on their run of &#8220;princess&#8221; films with 2010&#8217;s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0398286/"><strong>Tangled</strong></a>, which I thought was charmingly smart, sassy and very happy, to a point, to send up its own canon. But it still operated very much within the constraints of that canon &#8211; it was, in places, a bit like <strong>Legally Blonde</strong> in Fairytale Land &#8211; and I&#8217;m hoping this will bust the box open juuuust a bit more.</li>
<h3>BROW-FURROW!</h3>
<li>I think it&#8217;s interesting that Pixar have chosen, as far as I can tell, to make their first girl-POV movie begin from a starting problem of an arranged marriage tradition, and the synopsis as it stands (it&#8217;s on the io9 page) hints that they&#8217;re going with Little Mermaid-style tropes of &#8220;headstrong young woman consults wise woman for advice to avoid patriarchal problem; things go wrong&#8221;, and so on. Being critical for just a moment, I do think it would be good in the end to get to a Disney/Pixar film where female characters are not lone figures in a world of predominantly male characters, or on quests where the aim is to fight the male status quo. Or as one commenter on io9 put it, &#8220;I&#8217;m still waiting for the movie about the girl who doesn&#8217;t have to prove she&#8217;s awesome or that she&#8217;s as good as boys&#8221;. It makes me want to cheer and bounce off my chair when Merida fires that final arrow in front of all those shocked dudes, but I&#8217;d also quite like to just see her &#8230; go on a quest that isn&#8217;t about Defying Sexism. Lone Female Crusaders are all over our screens with relative frequency, from <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/03/23/at-the-movies-true-grit/"><strong>True Grit</strong>&#8216;s Mattie Ross</a> &#8211; who has a lump-throat-making scene where she packs her bags for adventure and stuffs rolls of newspaper in a man&#8217;s cowboy hat to make it fit her head &#8211; to <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/01/18/at-the-movies-the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo-oh-god-i-am-so-sorry-i-watched-the-remake-first/"><strong>The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo</strong>&#8216;s Lisbeth Salander</a> (arguably the ultimate Lone Woman On A Vengeful Spree for our time), and I&#8217;d like to see more scope for women in Hollywood stories to get to interact a bit more with <em>other women</em> &#8211; beyond, for example, &#8220;but mother, WHY can&#8217;t I do X&#8221; and &#8220;yes, sorceress, I will make this dodgy deal with you!&#8221; at the very least.</li>
<h3>BACK TO HURRAH-ING!</h3>
<li>Buuuut the fact remains that this scene still makes me go misty eyed and wibbly at the slightest provocation. I love how it looks and feels, and it&#8217;s got Billy Connolly (playing Princess Merida&#8217;s warlord dad, with whom she seems to have a pleasingly co-conspirator relationship rather than what I call the King Triton Model, though this does mean relations with mum aren&#8217;t looking cosy), Emma Thompson, Julie Walters (the wise woman conflict catalyst!) and more on board. It&#8217;s been co-authored by two women (for anyone casually interested in the gender balance of the creative team) and I&#8217;m honestly so excited (IT HAS A BEAR IN IT I LOVE BEARS I HOPE SHE DOES NOT SHOOT THE BEAR) that I&#8217;m really glad it won&#8217;t be long now.</li>
<li>ENTIRELY SPECULATION, BUT ANYWAY: On the fairy tale riffing front, I&#8217;m pleased to see such an obvious Robin Hood folklore moment referenced in the scene above &#8211; he, of course, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_v1OaC4jv1c#t=4m59s">splits an arrow just like this</a> in his own quest to win Maid Marion, and in this version the princess is out to win&#8230;her own hand. Neat. Since it was originally titled <em>The Bear and the Bow</em>, so presumably has a bear of some importance in the story, it&#8217;s also got me wondering whether it&#8217;ll draw on beast stories like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_of_the_Sun_and_West_of_the_Moon">East of the Sun, West of the Moon</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brown_Bear_of_Norway">Brown Bear of Norway</a>. The idea is that the woman goes on a journey and finds a man/foils a curse along the way. That might not happen in <strong>Brave</strong> at all, but since the opening problem is marriage-related I&#8217;d be surprised if no options around the topic came up, and if it doesn&#8217;t happen like that, that&#8217;ll be an attempt at subversion in itself. Either way, I think with the final title being <strong>Brave</strong> I&#8217;m optimistic about how it&#8217;ll turn out for Merida.</li>
<li>THERE IS A HORSE IN IT AND HIS NAME IS ANGUS. I love Disney&#8217;s horses. They&#8217;ve carved out a noble niche as providers of bathos and irony over the years from <a href="http://disney.wikia.com/wiki/Samson_(Sleeping_Beauty)">Samson</a> through to <a href="http://disney.wikia.com/wiki/Maximus">Maximus</a>. ANGUS, I HAVE HIGH HOPES FOR YOU. (Although I kind of wish you were an <a href="http://maxbarry.com/2011/07/08/news.html">Elspeth</a>, maybe? I mean, Maximus would&#8217;ve been fine as&#8230; Agrippina, you know?) Oh God, now everyone&#8217;s going to think I&#8217;m really weird. Uh. Moving on.</li>
<li>Conclusion: Any road, I think my DVD shelf can take one more Lone Female Crusader in this instance. See you in the cinema.</li>

					<description><![CDATA[A fantastic, inspiring lesson from Indian publishing house Tara Books in how to adapt Hans Christian Anderson for today's children.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think I first encountered the <strong>Little Mermaid</strong> story when Disney&#8217;s film dropped in 1989. Mermaid Mania quickly descended, and &#8220;mermaid!&#8221; began to trump &#8220;fireman!&#8221; when people asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. I&#8217;ve had a soft spot for mermaids and sea sirens ever since.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/the-little-mermaid-ladybird-well-loved-tales-book-1497-p.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="5362" data-permalink="/2011/05/09/fairy-tale-fest-the-best-adaptation-of-the-little-mermaid-ive-ever-seen/the-little-mermaid-ladybird-well-loved-tales-book-1497-p/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/the-little-mermaid-ladybird-well-loved-tales-book-1497-p.jpg?fit=200%2C301&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="200,301" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;3.1&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;FinePix J25&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1287414941&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;6.3&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;200&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.033333333333333&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="ladybirdmermaid" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/the-little-mermaid-ladybird-well-loved-tales-book-1497-p.jpg?fit=199%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/the-little-mermaid-ladybird-well-loved-tales-book-1497-p.jpg?fit=200%2C301&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5362" title="ladybirdmermaid" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/the-little-mermaid-ladybird-well-loved-tales-book-1497-p.jpg?resize=200%2C301" alt="Cover for Ladybird edition of The Little Mermaid.

The Mermaid <em>died</em> at the end? She <em>didn&#8217;t</em> marry the prince? And then was turned into a &#8220;Daughter of the Air&#8221;, and wasn&#8217;t allowed a Christian soul unless a zillion children did good deeds and something-something-virtue? What a letdown. Expecting a straightforward happy ending, I was utterly bewildered. Prince or no prince, I hadn&#8217;t been prepared for quite so much all-out morbidity, and if you asked me, this Daughters of the Air business just sounded a bit suspicious.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s one hell of a leap from the all-out romance of Disney&#8217;s riff on the story to Anderson. Disney takes Anderson&#8217;s curious young mermaid princess and gives her a bit of sass, focusing the story on themes of adolescence and coming of age and adding a saleable happy ending into the mix. It&#8217;s a common refrain on feminist blogs to say that Disney &#8220;sanitised the originals&#8221; (whatever &#8220;original&#8221; means). Here, though, Disney at least allows Ariel her desires, even if they are chastely presented, and allows their fulfilment at the end. By contrast, Anderson focuses on the dangers of curiosity and makes the story arc a recognisably tragic one &#8211; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Mermaid#Debate_over_ending">and later, it seems, tacked on the stuff about the Daughters of the Air to add in a moral imperative for the reader</a>: <em>children, be good, else the mermaid will never earn her Christian soul! </em></p>

There&#8217;s something problematic about both of them &#8211; with Anderson&#8217;s version, as Marina Warner puts it in <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Beast-Blonde-Fairy-Tales-Tellers/dp/0099479516"><strong>From The Beast To The Blonde: On Fairy Tales And Their Tellers</strong></a>, &#8220;the story&#8217;s chilling message is that cutting out your tongue is still not enough. To be saved, more is required: self-obliteration , dissolution.&#8221;  With Disney, Warner ruminates that &#8220;the issue of female desire dominates the film&#8230; the verb &#8216;want&#8217; falls from the lips of Ariel more often than any other &#8211; until her tongue is cut out&#8221;, concluding that &#8211; however much we want to cry &#8220;sanitised!&#8221; &#8211; it is more that in the film &#8220;romance constitutes the ultimate redemption, and romantic love, personified by the prince, the justification of desire&#8221;.  So it&#8217;s a <em>kind</em> of sanitising, but it&#8217;s also a secularising.</p>
<p>All of which brings me to <a href="https://www.tarabooks.com/books/books/adults/picture-books--visual-arts/the-flight-of-the-mermaid/"><strong>The Flight of the Mermaid</strong></a>, <strong>Gita Wolf </strong>and <strong>Sirish Rao</strong>&#8216;s adaptation of the tale, a wonderful picture book, now recently reprinted by India-based publishing house <a href="http://www.tarabooks.com/"><strong>Tara Books</strong></a>. This version re-energises Anderson&#8217;s original storyline and tells it in such a way that it becomes, devoid of its Victorian moralising, a genuinely life-affirming, feminist story.  The real achievement, though, is that it <em>keeps </em>the Daughters of the Air stuff, and Anderson&#8217;s story structure, but tells the story in such a way that a happy ending is forged.  And it&#8217;s an ending that retains the sense for wanderlust Disney gives its heroine, but doesn&#8217;t end in the mermaid trading selfhood or identity for marriage &#8211; at the same time neatly avoiding Anderson&#8217;s preachy, morbid shutdown of female desire or personal autonomy.</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s start with basic facts: the book is <em>gorgeous.</em> Check it out!</p>

Beautifully letter-pressed on tactile, thick-grain paper, the cover has a press-out fish shape which doubles as a bookmark and reveals the mermaid herself underneath. The book is fully illustrated with acclaimed artist <strong>Bhajju Shyam</strong>&#8216;s distinctive artwork in the Gond tribal style, and the results are a wonderful, fresh contrast to the European visualisations of this story I&#8217;ve become so used to. Look how colourful it is!</p>

<p>The title of the book also describes the ending (skip to after the grey blockquotes if you don&#8217;t want the detail spoilered!) &#8211; the mermaid comes to the realisation that the prince, though he is fond of her, does not love her romantically. She is saddened, but will not kill him &#8211; the only way she can save her own life &#8211; and chooses to sacrifice herself instead: yes, familiar Anderson territory. And yet:</p>
<blockquote><p>Slowly, the truth came over her &#8211; her plight had nothing to do with the prince at all&#8230; he knew nothing of her, and could not carry the weight of her dreams.</p></blockquote>
<p>And at the point where, in Anderson, her tragic end is mitigated only by the Daughters of the Air announcing &#8220;welcome to the airy feminine purgatory party!&#8221;, Wolf, Rao and Shyam show the mermaid&#8217;s transition into the air as a change, not an ending:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; she asked, and found that her voice had returned.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are the daughters of the air, they answered. &#8220;And now you are one of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The mermaid was delighted.  &#8220;I was born into water,&#8221; she said to them. &#8220;And I know the world on the shore too. Only the air is left to explore, and it seems to hold more freedom than sea or land.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The air is, logically, her next destination on a continuous journey. Always on the move, the mermaid&#8217;s real aim is constant self-discovery and adventure. Visually, in each of her phases on land, sea, and air, she retains her flowing hair and colourful attributes, whether they are feathers or scales. Her identity is always hers, and is never relinquished.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a wonderfully executed blend of the positive points of both Anderson&#8217;s text and the optimism the Disney generation have come to expect from the story, and for parents, schools and people who love beautifully made books, I just can&#8217;t recommend Tara Books highly enough.</p>
<p>We managed to grab five minutes of co-author Gita Wolf&#8217;s time, via email, to ask her a little about the book &#8211; why this story?</p>
<p>&#8220;We felt that the story had universal resonance,&#8221; says Gita.  &#8220;It was both a coming-of-age tale as well as the story of a journey (both literal and spiritual). When we first told the story to Bhajju Shyam, he related to it right away. &#8216;That&#8217;s exactly it!&#8217; he said, &#8216;That&#8217;s what it feels like to come into a completely new element &#8211; like when I traveled to another country for the first time. I lost my language, and it felt like I was [as Anderson&#8217;s mermaid experiences when she loses her voice] walking on knives.'&#8221;</p>
<p>How about the ending? &#8220;We wanted to give the tale a feminist twist, and not focus on the loss of the prince as an absolute tragic end of everything &#8211; nor did we want the Disney ending. In keeping with Anderson&#8217;s basic narrative, the Mermaid in a sense does go up in the air, but the air is here a new element to explore, and her journey will continue.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Disney princesses have a BadRep with feminists, and let&#8217;s face it, it&#8217;s easy to see why. Even the recent ones have waists which are about as thick as their wrists, and the individual life lessons from each could be perceived as so warped as to <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2010/05/24/what-disney-princess.html">have become an internet meme</a>.</p>
<p>But is this really a case of &#8220;Disney-fication&#8221;, with the studio taking fairy tales and imposing ruthless mainstream norms on them? There is a huge body of work which looks at folk stories from a feminist perspective, and I&#8217;m not so qualified to talk about that. What I do find interesting is how incredibly polarised much of the source material was in the first place.</p>

(Source: Wikipedia.)</p></div>
<p>In the European fairy tales which made it big in England and the US (mostly Grimm and some French romances), good people are Beautiful and bad people are Ugly. This is true whether you&#8217;re a stepsister, a witch or an ogre; physical ugliness goes along with agressive or dangerous behaviour every time. <strong>Good = Beautiful</strong>, and this is not negotiable. (Try the reverse: try finding anyone ugly who you&#8217;re meant to cheer for. You&#8217;ve got maybe a 1% chance. Less if they&#8217;re female.)</p>
<p>It gets better though, because that &#8220;bad&#8221; behaviour is very specific: it is always an act against the interests of the Heroine or Hero. Being a female magic-user doesn&#8217;t make you a witch; you could be a fairy godmother. No-one asks the Godmothers what they spend the rest of their time doing, they are entirely defined by whether they bless or curse the Heroine. In some tales, it&#8217;s only because one out of thirteen of them is not given an invitation that she decides to curse the child &#8211; would the others have acted similarly if it had been one or more of them instead? We don&#8217;t know. But once the curse is given, that Godmother is fair game for a horrible death and probably had a secret hooked nose all along. The Disney versions of Fairy Godmothers may be tittering clouds of pink benevolence, but they aren&#8217;t often described as &#8220;kind&#8221; in the tales &#8211; they are only judged as &#8220;Good&#8221; or &#8220;Bad&#8221; by whether they&#8217;re currently on our side or not.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also problematical if we use behaviour to judge who the &#8220;good girl&#8221; is. The modern versions of Cinderella, Snow White and Sleeping Beauty are all very similar: beautiful, virtuous daughters who get into trouble and need rescuing. It might be a fall into poverty, or danger from an outsider (new stepmother, <del datetime="2011-05-02T11:32:43+00:00">hot men</del> a wolf) but there&#8217;s one critical element to being the Good girl and that is <em>passivity</em>. Red Riding Hood doesn&#8217;t kill the wolf. Cinderella runs away and is found (hunted down door-to-door, really) by the Prince, without announcing herself even up to the moment that the shoe goes on. He and her fairy Godmother are the ones taking all the action to save her. Snow White / Sleeping Beauty are unconscious/dead.</p>
<p>We already saw in Markgraf&#8217;s <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/04/22/at-the-movies-red-riding-hood/">movie review of Red Riding Hood</a> that a young woman choosing the wrong man could derail society&#8217;s plans (in a time when arranged marriages to a virgin were crucial). All these messages are saying that you need to be compliant, dutiful and passive. If you are a woman who is aggressive, demanding, loud, insists on her own needs or has control over her life, chances are you&#8217;re a wicked stepmother and only a few days away from the awesome kind of ending Disney oddly decided to leave out:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&#8220;That she should be thrown into a cask stuck around with sharp nails, and that two white horses should be put to it, and should drag it from street to street till she is dead.&#8221;</strong><br />
The Goose Girl &#8211; Brothers Grimm</p></blockquote>
<p>The destiny of the Hero is often no less automatic. He is invariably given a beautiful Princess as a prize, to be his wife. Winning her hand is sometimes the only reason he takes on the quest in the first place. The task is often set by her father, who expects the Hero to be killed instead of succeeding, and at no time does the woman have any say in this arrangement.</p>
<p>So given the source material for the stories which Disney decided to take on, if they remained roughly true to the spirit of the tale, is it really fair to bash Disney as much as we do?</p>
<p>Oh hell yes.</p>
<p>First of all, they have a choice on which ones to produce. Chrissy Derbyshire in her essay &#8220;Toads and Diamonds&#8221; for <a href="http://avaloniabooks.co.uk/221/?page_id=438">the anthology &#8220;Vs&#8221;</a> (which looks at Duality in magic, mythology and religion) points out that there are tales where the magic is entirely neutral, such as a Genie granting wishes. If the person making the wish is bad, sucks to be them. If they are altruistic and peaceful, they&#8217;ll probably be okay. There are plenty of tales Disney could have gone with which say &#8220;a person&#8217;s actions define them&#8221;, not &#8220;poverty and an evil stepmother can only be solved by marrying the right guy&#8221;.</p>
<p>Now okay, not all of the stories which deviate from the &#8220;good gets rewarded&#8221; trope would make great movies. I think it&#8217;s a Brothers Grimm tale which reads roughly (and I am not making this up) &#8220;<em>Little Erik was a good boy and never did anything wrong, but one he died anyway because that&#8217;s just how it goes sometimes.</em>&#8221; I can see how choosing your targets for conversion to animation is a valid excuse.</p>
<p>Even within that though, there&#8217;s still the question of the famous Disney poetic licence. They have a history of sanitising and whitewashing these stories for maximum profit, and it&#8217;s very rarely to inject any feminist ideas. Sure, in the 90s the women such as Belle in <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> became Independent and Argumentative&#8230; but only in strictly approved mainstream ways, to entirely fit the current belief of what would be PC. There are no lesbians in Disney, no women who don&#8217;t want a lifelong relationship by the end. It may be that the Victorians had already santised the tales by the time Disney picked them up, but that only works as an excuse for so long.</p>
<p>Okay, Sleeping Beauty physically <em>can&#8217;t</em> save herself &#8211; there&#8217;s no way Disney could have got around that &#8211; but even when they try to be PC in recent efforts it is only ever in a way which won&#8217;t scandalise the lowest common denominator of American audiences. The source material may praise beauty, passivity and rescuing, but Disney have never hesitated to edit other aspects of the stories to something more palatable. Even in recent times when the female characters actually have, well, <em>character</em>, the one aspect which apparently <em>mustn&#8217;t</em> change is the straining of credibility that their tiny bodies wouldn&#8217;t collapse under the weight of their own organs. (Check the link in the first paragraph. Look at Jasmine&#8217;s waist and wrists. Or Ariel&#8217;s. Sleeping Beauty is presumably wearing a corset, but I&#8217;m not sure if that&#8217;s an improvement when you&#8217;re marketing at six year-olds.)</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m a guy who hasn&#8217;t seen many of the Disney Princess movies more than a dimly-remembered once, I haven&#8217;t read the reconstructed feminist versions of fairy tales, and my love of Angela Carter aside I&#8217;m much less qualified to write about this stuff than&#8230; well, most of the rest of Team BadRep.</p>
<p>So we&#8217;re going to town on this one. Oh yes.</p>
<p>All this week we&#8217;re having a <strong>Feminist Fairytale Fest </strong>here at BadRep. We&#8217;ll be looking at the incredibly brutal original versions which became censored, at modern reworkings, and at comment from feminists on how to find amazing nuggets of self-agency and adventuring by women in well-known classics!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This year, as many of us fill in the census, it&#8217;s also 100 years since the <a href="http://www.1911census.co.uk/">1911 census</a>, which women&#8217;s suffrage activists saw as another campaigning opportunity.</em></p>
<p>One of the best and oddest moments in the Disney canon is the appearance, halfway through <strong>Mary Poppins</strong>, of an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sister_Suffragette">all-singing all-dancing campaign for civil liberties</a>. &#8216;Sister Suffragette&#8217; isn&#8217;t without its problems – the song is half-pisstake, half-pastiche, and the film makes Mrs Banks’ dizzy preoccupation with Votes for Women another instance of parental neglect – but come on, it’s a subversively fluffy aside that puts a smile on the face, and it’s sometimes the first encounter with that fabulous creature, a suffragette, that people remember having.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_suffrage_in_the_United_Kingdom">campaign for women’s suffrage in this country</a> is such a great story that I’m surprised it’s never been the subject of its own Disney film. Apart from its narrative of struggle towards a goal undeniably justified in modern eyes, it’s got a whole array of glamorous heroines in petticoats and picture-hats and, eventually – after the false dawn of the 1918 Representation of the People Act which only included women property-owners aged over thirty – a happy ending. In particular, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_Social_and_Political_Union">Suffragette</a> taste for militantly iconoclastic protest would lend itself to iconic on-screen moments: women chained to the Downing Street railings, smashing windows, <a href="http://www.heritage-images.com/Preview/PreviewPage.aspx?id=1192504&#038;pricing=true&#038;licenseType=RM">occupying civic buildings</a>, enduring imprisonment and force-feeding and, not least, <strong>Emily Wilding Davison</strong>’s much-disputed martyrdom at the social event of the season, which actually was captured <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhF7NUNuZwA" target="_blank">on film</a> at the time.</p>

<p>Contrary to the Pathé News intertitle, Davison was not killed by her collision with George V’s horse at the 1913 Epsom Derby, but died four days later of the injuries sustained. She was forty. When people say women died for your right to vote, a fair proportion of them will be thinking of her.</p>
<p>Davison’s intentions on the day of the Derby are lost to history. Some historians believe her to have been intent on martyrdom, pointing to a previous incident during her imprisonment in<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strangeways_Prison"> Strangeways</a> where she threw herself off a balcony. On the other hand, the fact that she had purchased a return train ticket &#8211; and also a ticket to a suffragette dance later that day &#8211; suggests that she intended to return having only interrupted or disrupted the race – possibly by attaching a suffragette flag to the King&#8217;s horse. This would have been one more instance of Davison’s dedication to gaining attention for her chosen cause through publicity stunt and spectacle.</p>

Sylvia Pankhurst recalled her as &#8216;tall and slender&#8230; Her illusive, whimsical green eyes and thin, half-smiling mouth, bore often the mocking expression of the Mona Lisa&#8217;. She performed well at school, and defying many of the social orthodoxies imposed by Victorian society, won a place at Royal Holloway College, funding her own education through teaching work. In 1895 she studied for a term at Oxford, gaining First Class Honours in Modern Languages – despite, Oxford degrees being closed to women, having no opportunity to graduate. Having resumed her teaching career, Davison joined the Women&#8217;s Social and Political Union in 1906, quickly becoming its head steward as well as an active member of the socialist Workers&#8217; Educational Association and the Central Labour College.</p>
<p>Davison was one of around a thousand women imprisoned for political activities between 1903 and the outbreak of WWI. In March 1909, she was arrested for disturbance while attempting to hand a petition to the Liberal Prime Minister Herbert Asquith, and sentenced to one month in prison. Four months later, she attempted to gain access to a hall where the Chancellor of the Exchequer, David Lloyd George, was giving a speech, and was imprisoned for two months. Later in the same year, she and two other women were arrested for throwing stones at Lloyd George’s car, and sentenced to a month’s hard labour at Strangeways prison. The stones were wrapped in paper bearing Emily&#8217;s favourite saying: <em>Rebellion against tyrants is obedience to God.</em></p>
<p>While inside Strangeways, Davison went on hunger-strike. The prison authorities, <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Whunger.htm">in line with government policy</a>, responded by force-feeding her and, when she barricaded herself inside her cell to avoid this, came close to causing her death by flooding the cell with ice-cold water. This treatment appalled the public and was discussed in Parliament, with Labour leader <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Hardie">James Keir Hardie</a> advocating her release. Undaunted, Davison spent the next few years in and out of prison for setting fire to London post boxes, attacking a vicar she mistook for Lloyd George, and planting a bomb which severely damaged Lloyd George&#8217;s house in Surrey.</p>

<p>The public response to Davison’s death at the Epsom Derby was not immediately sympathetic: more information was printed about the health of the King’s horse and jockey (the latter making a full recovery and the former ‘suffering bruised shins’) than about the suffragettes’ cause, and the Daily Herald went on to print <a href="http://www.unb.ca/democracy/English/Ideas/Consent/Civil/ImagesDisobedience/cartoon1.jpg">a cartoon in dubious taste showing ‘Miss Davison’ as a skeleton holding a Votes For Women placard</a>. Posterity has been scarcely kinder, dismissing Davison as a mentally ill fanatic and proto-terrorist whose actions horrified both supporters and opponents of her cause, and which enabled the persistence of old arguments founded on the idea that women’s intrinsically irrational nature made them unsuited to political discourse and decision-making. Populist historian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Strange_Death_of_Liberal_England">George Dangerfield</a>’s depiction of the suffragettes as a frivolous frilly edge to the fall of Liberal England was a cue picked up by succeeding historians, who viewed the majority of women involved as playing at politics, succumbing to a fashionably edgy craze, indulging their innate feminine tendency to hysteria, and even masochistically courting the treatment they received from police and prison authorities. Not until the advent of women’s history in the 1970s were they treated more seriously and their struggle linked to that for wider suffrage in earlier decades: the first Woman&#8217;s Suffrage Bill was presented to Parliament in 1832, as part of the general struggle for reform and extension of the franchise to non-property-holding and working men. (It&#8217;s worth pointing out that the King&#8217;s jockey at the 1913 Derby, Herbert Jones, was not entitled to the vote either.) </p>

<p>Davison is buried at Morpeth Church with the WSPU motto ‘Deeds Not Words’ engraved on her headstone. Memorials to her are hard to find – like the suffragette monument <a href="http://exploringlondon.wordpress.com/2011/01/26/curious-london-memorials-4-the-suffragette-memorial/">tucked away in Victoria</a> – but one is in the House of Commons crypt, placed there by the Labour MP Tony Benn. It commemorates the night of the 1911 census when Davison hid in a cupboard in the Palace of Westminster overnight so that on the census form she could legitimately give ‘the House of Commons’ as her place of residence that night. (Ironically enough, other suffragettes were spending the night <a href="http://hwj.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2011/02/21/hwj.dbq064.full">evading the census</a> in protest at their exclusion from the franchise.) The census documents from 2nd April 1911 state that Davison was found &#8216;hiding in the crypt&#8217; in the Houses of Parliament. Whatever the suffragettes’ brand of protest represents today – a reckless eye for spectacle, a disregard for personal safety and security in pursuit of political goals, and a willingness to draw attention to oneself, all of which are valid weapons in the arsenal of political activists – escapades like that of Emily Davison on census night are the kind of minor gems that make the historical record sparkle.</p>

<p>(I could say something on how the temporary alliance of Mrs Banks and her domestics with the chimney-sweeps at the end of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2fMlg5WTMM&#038;feature=player_detailpage#t=434s">&#8216;Step in Time&#8217;</a>, and their consequent disruption of the bourgeois patriarchal hegemony of the Banks household through dance, is a commendable representation of a socialist-feminist popular front, but that&#8217;s a whole other post.)</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Funny Etymology Submission #billion: lady sprung from the Old English hlaefdige (I dunno, I didn't do Old English), a compound of hlaf ('loaf') and dig ('to knead'). So a lady is literally 'she who kneads loaves'.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<h6 style="text-align: center;">L</h6>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">LADY</h2>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: normal;">&#8216;My lady&#8217;, as her friends called her, sincerely desired to be a genuine lady, and was so at heart, but had yet to learn that money cannot buy refinement of nature, that rank does not always confer nobility, and that true breeding makes itself felt in spite of external drawbacks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">Louisa May Alcott, </span><strong>Good Wives </strong>(1869)</p></blockquote>
<h3>She&#8217;s A Lady.</h3>
<p>Funny Etymology Submission #billion: <em>lady </em>sprung from the Old English <em>hlaefdige </em>(I dunno, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKLNp890Qlc">I didn&#8217;t do Old English</a>), a compound of <em>hlaf</em> (&#8216;loaf&#8217;) and <em>dig</em> (&#8216;to knead&#8217;). So a <em>lady </em>is literally &#8216;she who kneads loaves&#8217;.</p>
<p>I guess you can kind of see where it went from there, since its original (now obsolete) meaning is as &#8216;the female head of the household&#8217;; i.e., the one what does the cooking, with the ambiguity that still runs through many households where Mum&#8217;s In Charge, but Dad&#8217;s Earning. Thus, in its second meaning (also Old English), it becomes &#8216;A woman who rules over subjects<em>&#8216;, </em>now only used in &#8216;poetical&#8217; or &#8216;rhetorical&#8217; senses. But in extended Middle English usage, it&#8217;s refined to &#8216;A woman who is the object of a man&#8217;s devotion; a mistress, lady-love&#8217;.</p>
<h3>That&#8217;s No Lady, That&#8217;s My Wife.</h3>
<p>Here we enter the troubled seas of <em><a href="http://www.harkavagrant.com/index.php?id=282">courtly love</a></em>, that pretty part of medieval culture peopled by sighing knights sitting under rose-bushes. Supposedly &#8216;invented&#8217; by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_of_Aquitaine">Eleanor of Aquitaine</a>, at her court in Poitiers, it was brought to England with her marriage to Henry II in 1152.</p>

<p>The basic idea was an almost iconoclastic worship of your <em>lady-love</em>,<em> </em>whose favours you sought through brave deeds, refined behaviour and that sort of thing. The highest &#8216;favour&#8217; was the fantastically ambiguous &#8216;naked embrace&#8217; (although you might well sleep with an unsheathed sword between you), and your &#8216;lady-love&#8217;<em> </em>didn&#8217;t have to be a viable option – she could be married, generically unavailable, or just someone you&#8217;d never met but heard lots about down the alehouse. She was a spur to bravery, swordplay and courtliness, not, like, your <em>girlfriend</em>.</p>
<h3>Lay Lady Lay.</h3>
<p>But courtly love was emphatically not a concept that elevated<em> hoi polloi</em>: your lady would be a <em>lady</em> in the fourth sense of the word (&#8216;a woman of superior social position&#8217;) and quite possibly also in the specific extended sense of the second, &#8216;the female corresponding to lord&#8217; (Lord and Lady Godiva).</p>
<p>In contrast, <em>peasants</em> &#8216;are impelled to acts of love in the natural way like a <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/12/06/an-alphabet-of-femininism-10-j-is-for-jade/">horse</a> or a mule&#8217;, in the words of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Capellanus">Andreas Capellanus</a>, who quite literally wrote the rule book for courtly love. Capellanus advises his readers to steer clear of the &#8216;game&#8217; of love where the lower classes are involved, and, if overcome with lust, to &#8216;find a suitable spot [and] not delay in taking what you seek, gaining it by rough embraces&#8217;<sup><a href="/2010/12/20/an-alphabet-of-femininism-12-l-is-for-lady/#footnote_0_1557" id="identifier_0_1557" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" &hellip;all translations are P.G. Walsh&rsquo;s: it&rsquo;s too early in the morning to read blogposts in Medieval Latin. ">1</a></sup> .</p>
<p>And such attitudes are never far from this most &#8216;pretty&#8217; of love-traditions – a lyric in the <em>Carmina Burana </em>(c.1230) tells what happens when, despite &#8216;long service&#8217;, the <em>lady </em>still denies her knight &#8216;the final and best stage&#8217;:</p>
<blockquote><p>She rampages with her sharp nails, tears my hair, forcefully repels my violence. She coils herself and entwines her knees to prevent the door of her maidenhead from being unbarred. But at last my campaign makes progress; [&#8230;] I tighten by embraces our entwined bodies, I pin her arms, I implant hard kisses. In this way Venus&#8217; palace is unbarred.</p></blockquote>
<p>The ambiguous power-structure at the heart of being someone&#8217;s <em>lady </em>could hardly be clearer.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 13px;">All this said, if you were Specially Virtuous, courtly love was the ideal forum for worshipping a very specific <em>lady</em> – the word&#8217;s third sense, &#8216;Our Lady&#8217;, the Virgin Mary. </span><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 13px;">Ah, Mary. Everybody loves Mary, and throughout the middle ages, she picked up honorific titles like a big bit of blue velcro: &#8216;Our Lady&#8217;, &#8216;Our Blessed Lady&#8217;, &#8216;Our Lady of Sorrows&#8217;, &#8216;the Queen of Heaven&#8217;, &#8216;the Blessed Virgin&#8217; you name it. She even had a special colour-code – white (sometimes red) and blue. Pre-<em>Prussian Blue</em> (discovered in 1704), blues were the most expensive painting pigments, so someone decided MARY SHALL WEAR ONLY BLUE, WE LOVE HER SO.</span></p>
<p>Nevertheless, Mary has an evil analogue: post-Reformation, there are plenty of references to the &#8216;Lady of Rome&#8217; or the &#8216;Lady of Babylon&#8217;, an abusive term for the Catholic church in reference to the &#8216;scarlet woman&#8217; of the Apocalypse. The dichotomy continues outside religion: see also <em>lady</em>&#8216;s more worldly senses: <em>lady of easy virtue, lady of the town</em>, etc.</p>
<h3>The Lady Is A Tramp.</h3>
<p>In modern usage, <em>lady</em>&#8216;s social standing is &#8216;loosely defined but not very high&#8217;; often, it is &#8216;merely a courteous synonym for <em>woman</em>&#8216;, giving a strange social gloss to cisgendered biological fact. It was around 1861 (just before <strong>Good Wives</strong>) that it got its more specific sense as &#8216;a woman whose manners, habits and sentiments are those characteristic of the higher ranks of society&#8217;.</p>
<p>This could be interpreted as Alcott uses it, or, if you are Walt Disney, as exactly what it says: think <strong>Lady and the Tramp</strong><em> </em>(1955), one of many poor boy &#8211; rich girl tales. The title plays on Sinatra&#8217;s song &#8216;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VJY97l0jVA">T<strong>he Lady Is A Tramp</strong></a>&#8216;, which is repeated in strangely sexualised <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BN69gnkNtLo">form in the film </a>about the Tramp himself (you could never have a female <em>tramp</em>). The same idea returns in feline form in <strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-iUVGcym3o">The Aristocats</a></strong><em> </em>(1970), where again Society wins but appropriates some of the gritty male spark from the other side of the tracks. For polite desecration only, please.</p>
<p>So a <em>lady </em>can stand for certain upper-class &#8216;manners, habits and sentiments&#8217; that are in opposition to those of a simple <em>man or</em> <em>woman. </em>From courtly love to the leash and collar set, the feminized force of sophistication calms, restrains, and decorates.</p>
