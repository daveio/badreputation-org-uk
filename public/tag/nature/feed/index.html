<p>A while back I told you about my favourite cyborg, <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/11/02/battle-angel-alita-and-cyborg-feminism/"><strong>Battle Angel Alita</strong></a>. Well, now I’d like to introduce you to my favourite flying plant woman, in the second in my series on really old comic books I have a tenuous excuse to blog about. Here comes the excuse…</p>
<p>Like feminism? Like <strong>Neil Gaiman</strong>? Then you may be happy to hear that there is a new book being put together of essays about JUST THESE THINGS. Abstract submissions have just closed, and <a title="Death, Desire, Fury and Delirium: Feminism in the Worlds of Neil Gaiman" href="http://web.me.com/penandpaper/gaimanandfeminism/Welcome.html" target="_blank"><em><strong>Death, Desire, Fury, and Delirium: Feminism in the Worlds of Neil Gaiman</strong></em></a> is on track to be published in early 2012.</p>
<p>This got me thinking back to Gaiman’s 1988 story <strong>Black Orchid</strong>. Unusual, poetic and full of references, I think it’s a cracking comic. And it’s illustrated by <strong>Dave McKean</strong> (channeling <a href="http://www.tragsnart.co.uk/arthub/okeeffe/okeeffe.htm">Georgia O’Keeffe</a>) so it’s beautiful. Really – alternately lush and gritty, humming with colour, splattered with monochrome… it ruined other graphic novels for me from a very early age.</p>
<p>Since this is Gaiman, there are also some classy cameos: Lex Luthor, Batman, Swamp Thing (obviously) and a trip around Arkham Asylum which includes a for-once-actually-pretty-scary Poison Ivy.<br />
<BR></BR></p>
<h3>What’s the story?</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Orchid">original Black Orchid</a> was a Bronze Age superhero who sounds pretty kickass (being invulnerable and superstrong and able to fly &#8216;n&#8217; all…). But rather than simply rebooting the character and reworking her origin story, Gaiman does something pretty daring: he kills her off. On page ten. And with her the story sloughs off a heap of superhero clichés and leaps to somewhere and something altogether different.</p>
<p>As Black Orchid dies (caught out trying to infiltrate LexCorp) another being wakes up in a greenhouse somewhere else with some of her memories. The story follows her quest to discover her identity and protect herself and her clone sister &#8211; another human-plant hybrid &#8211; from the clutches of those who were pursuing the first Black Orchid, and from the abusive ex pursuing the woman she used to be.</p>
<h3>Genderfun</h3>
<p>I probably don’t need to say that there’s a lot of interesting stuff about identity and memory in there. There are also a lot of very feminine tropes about nature, healing, nurturing, non-violence and motherhood &#8211; the older Orchid acts as mother to her younger sister, and even Poison Ivy has some disturbing &#8216;babies&#8217; in Arkham &#8211; which are certainly not commonplace in your standard superhero comic.</p>

<p>But this isn’t your standard superhero comic &#8211; this is a story about a superhero who isn’t a superhero. Who isn’t the same character she was when you started the book. All sorts of assumptions come tumbling down. Who’s the Big Bad? When’s the big fight? What’s her snappy comeback?</p>
<p>Like its contemporary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen"><strong>Watchmen</strong></a>, the story questions the superhero myth and structure, upends and subverts it, teases out the stories stuck between the monoliths of Good and Evil. But it comes at it from an entirely different place. You could argue that in <strong>Watchmen</strong> the myth of the superhero consumes itself in a hyper-masculine world of science and violence, while in Black Orchid superheroic power is rejected for a hyper-feminine power of nature and passive resistance.</p>
<p>In fact Dr Julia Round <em>has</em> argued the second bit. In her <a href="http://www.scottishwordimage.org/debatingdifference/abstracts.html">paper</a> <em>‘Can I call you “Mommy”?’ Myths of the female and superheroic in Neil Gaiman and Dave McKean’s Black Orchid</em> she explains firstly how the “non-egoistic collectivism” of Black Orchid’s shared, continuous identity overturns the “heroic individualism” of the superhero myth.</p>
<p>Even the look of the book resists the powerful iconography of the traditional superhero story – think of Superman’s ‘S’ and the bat sign, the cape, and even the idea of the costume itself:</p>
<blockquote><p>Black Orchid inverts expectations of this type, as the Orchids are not costumed or linked to any specific logo. Instead they are characterized by splashes of colour in a monochrome cityscape and, in their natural surroundings, simply merge with the background. This aesthetic contributes to Black Orchid’s redefinition of the superheroic, using painted artwork that is feminised in its watercolour appearance and use of purple shades.</p></blockquote>
<p>As the plot progresses, Black Orchid resists and escapes the men pursuing her, but doesn’t attack them. Batman encourages her to become a crime-fighter like the first Black Orchid, but she retreats. As Round says, “she is not a masculine defender of the state, but instead wants only to retreat from society and reproduce.” Yes, really. I did say <em>hyper</em>-feminine (‘a woman’s just gotta nurture!’)  Much as I love Black Orchid, it certainly throws up some problems. How can I give a thumbs up for her non-violent resistance and at the same time be hoping she’s going to impale the bad guy on a tree?</p>
<p>The final showdown between Black Orchid and Luthor’s henchmen isn’t a heroic battle, as Black Orchid refuses to go with them but also refuses to fight them, saying just “Do what you have to do.” I won’t spoil the ending, but I can say it’s not the way Alita would have done it.</p>
<h3>Ecofeminism</h3>

<p>That said, Alita does sacrifice herself at the end of her series to save the world. But only after she’s exhausted every possible ass-kicking route. In fact <strong>Black Orchid</strong> makes an interesting contrast with <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/11/02/battle-angel-alita-and-cyborg-feminism/"><strong>Battle Angel Alita</strong></a>, as the ‘cyborg feminism’ for which I think Alita makes such a good figurehead was proposed as an alternative to the popularity of ‘ecofeminism’ in the early 1980s. And I can think of few better poster girls for ecofeminism than Black Orchid.</p>
<p>Broadly, <a href="http://www.wloe.org/WLOE-en/background/ecofeminism.html">ecofeminism</a> is a branch of our beautiful multiple complicated movement that focuses on a connection (and an implied sympathy) between the exploitation of the natural world and the oppression of women. There are a lot of sound reasons to make this link: women are usually affected first and worst by environmental damage, women make up the majority of the world’s agricultural workers, and yet it is overwhelmingly men who own land and control access to natural resources. And the association of the feminine with nature and Mother Earth is a deep and powerful one, which has been cast in a renewed positive light, thanks largely to ecofeminism.</p>
<p>Sadly though the movement has also spawned a lot of guff &#8211; about wafty earth goddesses, women’s spiritual connection to the natural world, their innate love of cute fluffy animals and the terrifying, all-encompassing juggernaut of their need to nurture something, anything &#8211; to which I do not subscribe.</p>
<p>But to show I don’t hold the theory to blame, I’d like to direct you to some brilliant and important work being done in the name of ecology and feminism by the <a href="http://www.wen.org.uk/">Women’s Environmental Network</a>. Also: go and read <strong>Black Orchid</strong>, and tell me what you think.</p>
<h3>A couple of disclaimers&#8230;</h3>
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;m using ‘masculine’ and ‘feminine’ to refer to the traits, qualities, symbols and associated ideas that are loosely grouped around those words in most Western culture and emphatically NOT referring to men and women.</li>
<li> When I’m talking about the ‘superhero myth’ I’m using ‘myth’ in the semiotic sense (as Round does in her article) rather than ‘myth’ in the straight up stories and legends sense. There’s quite a good definition <a href="http://www.rdillman.com/HFCL/TUTOR/Semiotics/sem4.html#MYTH">here</a> for anyone who’s interested.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Are you all sitting comfortably?</h3>
<p>&#8216;Well, well,&#8217; I thought, as I cast my eye over the (now somewhat bedraggled) series of scrawled lists of letters for the Alphabet shoved into my pockets, bursting out of purses and sketchbooks and rotating in scarcely less tatty form in my head. For the question was obvious: What am I going to do for F? Because, you see, Z, Y, X, all those, they&#8217;re not actually that hard. They don&#8217;t have that much riding on them. But F &#8230; well, from the various incarnations of the F-word onwards &#8230; a headache.</p>
<p>Because, you see, the word <em>feminism</em><em> </em>just isn&#8217;t that interesting.</p>
<p>Or rather, its interest lies in its power to evoke wide-ranging, frequently violent reactions while remaining semantically straightforward. <em>Feminism</em><em> </em>gets precisely a centimetre of a three-column page in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary. Because it means two very simple and uncontentious things: in rare form, &#8216;the qualities of women&#8217;, and as it is more commonly understood today, &#8216;advocacy of the claims and rights of women&#8217;, first used sometime around 1895. All those extra things, the bad reputation &#8230; those are add-ons, and not linguistically valid ones, either. So I turned my attention away from <em>feminism</em>, and thought that perhaps I would go back to basics. After all, how often do we think about what <em>female</em><em> </em>means?</p>
<h3>Hey ho, let&#8217;s go.</h3>

Used with permission.</p></div>
<p>Well, it derives from the Middle English &#8216;femelle&#8217; via the Latin &#8216;femella&#8217; which is in turn a diminutive of &#8216;femina&#8217; (= &#8216;woman&#8217; &#8211; yes, another diminutive. They keep popping up, don&#8217;t they?) In its most basic incarnation, <em>female</em> simply means &#8216;belonging to the sex which bears offspring&#8217;. This does not <em>have</em> to involve birthing: let me tell you of the seahorses.</p>
<p>Despite his undisputed &#8216;masculine&#8217; role, the male seahorse receives a parcel of eggs from the female. Upon doing this, he sets out on an aqueous pregnancy-journey, bearing his unborn sea-foals in a pouch specially evolved for the purpose. During incubation, the female what knocked him up visits him each day for a brief catch-up (approximately six minutes), during which time they revisit the rituals of their courtship (holding tails, doing a little pre-dawn dance, smoking that bud and chillin&#8217;).</p>
<p>[Here, you must listen to <a href="http://open.spotify.com/track/7epShlu9CPsrBSm9YPBu7n">The Sea Horse by Flanders &amp; Swann</a>. I&#8217;ll wait here.]</p>
<p>Unlike words like <em>woman </em>and <em>lady</em>, <em>female</em> therefore has a very precise biological meaning that underscores its subsequent development: it is unsurprising that the next place it shows up in the dictionary is in botany (1791), where it refers to the parts of the plant that bear fruit, or, in reference to &#8216;a blossom or flower&#8217;, &#8216;having a pistil and no stamens; pistillate; fruit bearing&#8217; (slightly later: 1796). Of course, &#8216;perfect&#8217; plants are &#8216;bisexual&#8217; in that they possess both male and female parts (this latter, the &#8216;gynoecium&#8217;, literally meaning &#8216;woman house&#8217;). GCSE Biology ftw.</p>
<p>Alongside this specific development is an extremely general one: &#8216;consisting of females&#8217;, &#8216;pertaining to women&#8217; (the dictionary quotes Pope on &#8216;the force of female lungs&#8217;), and then &#8216;characteristic of womankind&#8217; in the seventeenth century and &#8216;womanish&#8217; in the eighteenth. It is curious that the usage here should be &#8216;<em>womankind</em>&#8216; rather than &#8216;femality&#8217; (of which more presently), since <em>woman </em>seems pretty clearly human, and therefore arguably more subjective, than a simple reference to the egg-bearing species.</p>
<h3>How low can you go?</h3>
<p>It is exactly this sort of little shift that leads to <em>female</em>&#8216;s seventh meaning, as an epithet of &#8216;various material and immaterial things, denoting simplicity, inferiority, weakness, or the like&#8217; (one wonders with alarm what &#8216;the like&#8217; might be). Here, of course, we have the realms of the &#8216;feminine rhyme&#8217;, which, while often weaker, are nonetheless much harder to pull off (and more effective, when successful) than any number of the old Moon and June. And mechanics also gets a shout out: <em>female </em>is there applied (as of 1669) to &#8216;that part of an instrument or contrivance which receives the corresponding male part&#8217;. (I love the dry non-specifics of &#8216;instrument or contrivance&#8217;.) However, it should come as no surprise to find that <em>female </em>eventually passes into apparently exclusively negative use: &#8216;as a synonym for &#8216;woman&#8217; now only contemptuous&#8217;.</p>
<blockquote><p>They are no ladies. The only word good enough for them is the word of opprobrium &#8211; females.</p>
<p>&#8211; Anonymous (1889)</p>
<p>&#8216;Female&#8217; &#8230; A circular hole or socket having a spiral thread adapted to receive the thread of the male screw.</p>
<p>&#8211; Anonymous (1669)</p></blockquote>
<p>By way of a postscript: some now rare variants on the word. <em>Femality</em> can be both &#8216;female nature&#8217; and &#8216;unmanliness&#8217;; <em>feminality </em>refers to &#8216;a knick-knack such as women like&#8217;, and <em>Feminie </em>is &#8216;Womankind; especially the <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/10/04/an-alphabet-of-femininism-1-a-is-for-amazon/">Amazons</a>&#8216;. We like it when things stay self-referential.</p>
