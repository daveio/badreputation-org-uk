					<description><![CDATA[She was arrested and imprisoned for 10 days for daring to drive. She's not the only one.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This post is part of a series on the theme of women and protest. The full series is collected <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/tag/revolting-women/">under the tag &#8220;Revolting Women&#8221;</a>.</em></p>
<p>So, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jun/17/saudi-arabia-women-drivers-protest?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487">this happened</a>.</p>
<p>In case you&#8217;ve been on the other side of the moon these past few months, the media&#8217;s much-touted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring">Arab Spring</a> had an interesting tangent via a discussion in the Saudi Council on whether women in Saudi Arabia should be allowed the vote. They eventually decided that yes, <a href="http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/311355">they probably should&#8230; eventually</a>. We wouldn&#8217;t want to rush these things. They won&#8217;t be able to contest the elections, of course, but least &#8211; if King Abdullah considers the recommendations &#8211; they may be able to cast a vote in the municipal elections.</p>
<p>Except that this small pittance of representation didn&#8217;t seem to be <a href="http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/saudi-arabia/saudi-s-vote-for-women-comes-a-little-late-activists-say-1.818813">satisfactory for women in Saudi Arabia</a>. So&#8230; well, see for yourselves. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowNSH_W2r0">Here is Manal al-Sharif driving in Saudi Arabia, and discussing what it means for her to do so</a>.</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/sowNSH_W2r0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>She was arrested and imprisoned for 10 days for daring to drive.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s not the only one. There&#8217;s an <a href="http://www.falsafh.com/vb/t7868.html">entire site of these vids</a> (<a href="http://www.saudiwomendriving.blogspot.com/">in fact</a>, <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=saudi+women+driving&amp;hl=en&amp;biw=1259&amp;bih=599&amp;prmd=ivnsu&amp;source=univ&amp;tbm=vid&amp;tbo=u&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AJnuTY-DCYyVswamo43vAw&amp;ved=0CG4QqwQ">more than one</a>): women driving in Saudi Arabia, in protest at&#8230; well, mostly not being allowed to drive. Here&#8217;s a <a href="https://twitter.com/@women2drive">twitter feed</a> of them doing it in style. In fact, June 17 saw 30 or 40 women behind the wheel, following weeks of an online campaign that saw women taping or photographing themselves driving. (If you&#8217;re wondering whether 30-40 people is a lot, consider what happened <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-13809684">the last time women tested this ban</a>. Think about what &#8216;punishment&#8217; means in Saudi Arabia. Then try to imagine being one of those women out there on 17 June.)</p>
<p>There is, of course, a danger to conflating correlation and causality. Yes, women protesting by driving happened to take place at about the same time that women&#8217;s voting rights were being revived for discussion in Saudi Arabia. It could have been a massive coincidence, and 30-40 women, however courageous, hardly make up a political movement all by themselves. And anyway, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Saudi_Arabian_protests">what does driving have to do with political representation</a>?</p>
<p><strong>The Times</strong>&#8216;s Janice Turner is pretty clear where she stands in a now-paywalled article titled <em>The Freedom of the Road is a Feminist Issue</em>. Consider being a woman in Saudi Arabia. Ignore all the discussions about political representation for the moment, and focus instead on the daily grind. You get up, you get dressed, you have to go to work or to the market or whatever. Luckily, your husband has hired you a car with your very own (male) driver&#8230; and should he feel perfectly comfortable in <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jCjEMaKSS2DG4aQE69Xd7dF-N_OA?docId=CNG.a3efd0be8f9ab484f7bd5528447add10.3d1">sexually assaulting you</a>, there is nothing you can do about it.</p>
<p>Or how about you forgo the potential dubious safety of a hired car and opt for a taxi. Prepare to walk the streets trying to hail one: streets where your mere presence outdoors may be cast as a sexual provocation. Inevitably, in trying to lock women away &#8216;for their own protection&#8217;, lest they be seen by vociferous male eyes, the Wahhabi religious laws have created a space so deeply hostile and threatening to women that their mere presence is transgressive. It is little wonder, then, that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manal_al-Sharif">Manal al-Sharif</a> talks about how safe she feels in her car, with her doors locked.</p>
<p>A person&#8217;s first car has always symbolised their freedom: be it at 17, with their newly-minted license and the entirety of the countryside filled with welcoming ditches to drive it into, or at 50, with a newly-issued divorce and a hesitant rediscovery of independent living. A woman who has a car gets to choose the place she is occupying. If she wants to leave, she is not dependent on anyone else. What could be more terrifying to the Saudi religious leaders? Never mind that neither the Koran nor the law bans women from driving; they were so terrified at the freedom driving would afford women that they went ahead and <a href="http://www.equalitynow.org/node/837">issued a fatwa</a> just to be safe.</p>

<p>So what actually happened on June 17th, when these 30-40 women took to the road? Did governments fall or cities rock? Reports differ. For one thing, no one can agree on the number. Even the <strong>Guardian</strong> seems confused, using the 30-40 figure in one article, and &#8220;<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/jun/18/saudi-arabia-women-drivers-protest">at least 45</a>&#8221; in another. The government of Saudi Arabia is in flat-out denial, refusing to acknowledge that the protest happened at all (despite a traffic ticket being issued).</p>
<p>Two weeks on, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jun/29/saudi-women-drivers-arrested-jiddah">five of the drivers were arrested</a>, despite early comments from the government that they would allow their families to &#8216;<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jun/30/saudi-arabia-not-egypt-reform">deal with them</a>&#8216;. Despite this, campaigners are not deterred, continuing to maintain a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-13928215">significant social media presence</a>. And even before the protest took place the Shoura declare that <a href="http://arabnews.com/saudiarabia/article447421.ece">they were ready to discuss women driving &#8220;if requested</a>&#8220;. I&#8217;m thinking that women risking arrest in order to parallel park in Riyadh would qualify as such.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Manal al-Sharif hasn&#8217;t given up. Since her release from custody, the former prisoner of conscience has been <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14240340">spearheading a movement to teach more and more women how to drive</a>. With the moderate King Abdullah on the throne, and the authorities apparently turning a blind eye to the recent on-road excursions by <a href="http://saudiwomendriving.blogspot.com/2011/09/emirates-247-reports-that-during-eid-al.html">three women during Eid</a>, it looks like the driving ban may not be in place for much longer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One day whilst sat at the side of the racetrack, I asked a fellow motorsport aficionado why there were so few women racing drivers. Actually, I’d sort of thought that maybe the female competitors had their own events like women’s 100m or women’s football, which involved precisely the same conditions and effort, but with added frills on their flame-proof suits. This lasted until the first multi-car pile-up, and I noticed that one of the cars freshly turned into car-putty had a woman’s name emblazoned on the bodywork.</p>

<p>So, if women compete in the same events as men – and why not, given that it is just as much about the cars as it is about the drivers – why are there so few women racing drivers? After all, there’s an entire association out there <a title="British Women Racing Drivers Club" href="http://www.bwrdc.co.uk/" target="_blank">promoting women in motorsport </a>with handy lists of everything you’ll need to buy to get started, and it’s not like lack of body mass would be a disadvantage in what is essentially a test of lightness and speed. OK, at the top ends you’re going to need some neck muscles to prevent you being spontaneously decapitated by your own car as you hit maximum G, but no more so than a female bodybuilder needs to achieve, surely. So why the lack?</p>
<p>To the internet! The wonders of googling “female racing drivers” yielded <a href="http://forums.digitalspy.co.uk/showthread.php?t=643482" target="_blank">this pertinent thread</a> where I didn’t learn much other than the names of four female drivers in the history of the entire sport. Thanks, guys, that totally answers my question.</p>
<p>Anyway, I decided to do a little more research. How do you become a racing driver? Surely you can’t just turn up outside Ferrari’s headquarters and demand to join their team? (Why hasn’t anyone tried this?) Silverstone’s driver <a title="Become a Racing Driver" href="http://www.silverstone.co.uk/track/driver-coaching/become-a-racing-driver/testimonials/" target="_blank">testimonials</a> are unsurprisingly all by men. They do have one thing in common, though: they all started young. The official site for the Ginetta Challenge, one of the many races I’d watched that day, has a helpful <a title="Ginetta: Become a Driver" href="http://ginetta.com/becomeDriver" target="_blank">flowchart</a> showing what it takes to get to the top of the league, as well as a price list. The <strong>Independent </strong>interviewed a <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/student/career-planning/getting-job/i-want-your-job-racing-driver-455919.html" target="_blank">young Porsche driver</a> and explained the top wage (£60k) and the likely costs (thousands of pounds if you don’t get sponsorship).</p>
<p>So, to summarise: this is a sport where you have to start investing hundreds, if not thousands, of pounds into a pre-teen child, shepherding them along and making them practise every waking hour until, in their mid-teens, they get signed up to a racing team that then commandeers their careers until they’re 35, at which point they’re <a title="Jenson Button has no retirement plan at 31" href="http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/sport/formula-one/Jenson+Button-4044.html" target="_blank">expected to retire</a>.</p>

<p>This is all well and good, and we can assume that no families on income support are ever going to produce the next Monaco GP winner. However, there is more to it than that. Starting that young, a child has to show a pretty strong preference for the sport, and the parents have to be supportive/pushy enough (delete as appropriate) to pour their savings into karting and rallying and fire extinguishers. They have to want it just as much as the child.</p>
<p>So there you are, eight years old, going up to mummy and daddy and saying, “I want to be a racing driver! Will you sign my permission slip?” And mummy and daddy look down on their precious little one and say, “Why don’t we buy you a new dolly instead?”</p>
<p>Maybe that’s not what happens to every little girl. Some undoubtedly come from racing families, and just as much effort is poured into their motorsport careers as would have been done for a male child. In some circles, with the right family emphasis, girls in motorsport can flourish. I’m guessing that this is about the same ratio as male ballet dancers.</p>
<p>To answer my own question, there <em>are</em> female racing drivers. <a title="Sabine Schmitz" href="http://www.speedbee.de" target="_blank"><strong>Sabine Schmitz</strong></a> is queen of the Nurburgring. <a title="Danica Patrick" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danica_Patrick" target="_blank"><strong>Danica Patrick</strong></a> rocks IndyCar and NASCAR. <a title="Amanda Whitaker" href="http://www.amandawhitaker.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Amanda Whitaker</strong> </a>won the National Formula Ford Championship. Wiki has a list of five – five! A veritable cornucopia of choice! – <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Female_Formula_One_drivers" target="_blank">Formula 1 female drivers</a>, including <strong>Desiré Wilson</strong>, the only female F1 driver to actually <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desir%C3%A9_Wilson" target="_blank">win anything</a> in Formula 1.  You can see an entire bevy of them in this poll listing the &#8220;<a title="10 sexiest women in motoring and motorsport" href="http://www.pistonheads.com/GASSING/topic.asp?h=0&amp;f=42&amp;t=543839" target="_blank">10 Sexiest Women in Motoring and Motorsport</a>&#8220;. Now not only am I armed with names, I also have cup-sizes. MY QUEST IS COMPLETE, GUYS.</p>
<p>I will leave you with the baffling sight of <strong>Top Gear</strong> &#8211; not precisely the bastion of political correctness &#8211; pointing out that this is insulting and patronising in the extreme:</p>
<p><iframe width="425" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/_Gy4YNkcQJg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Actually, I think it starts a lot earlier than that, but the sex kitten perception is unlikely to encourage any parent to finance his or her daughter&#8217;s racing dream.</p>
<p>My point is this: it takes a pretty determined kind of little girl to decide that she wants to go into motorsport when the whole world is insisting that she should be playing dress-up. And it takes a pretty supportive kind of family to encourage her, rather than simply buy her something frilly to shut her up. Maybe the tide is turning. Maybe the little girl with the need to go <em>faster faster faster</em> only needs to ask. But if it&#8217;s not turning fast enough, we will have an entire generation of little girls with no female motoring heroes to look to.</p>
<p>And I can promise you that no one ever tried to talk Jenson Button or Lewis Hamilton into playing with their dollies.</p>

I don’t understand the mindset of people like this. There you are, in your <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/03/18/secret-diary-of-a-female-petrolhead-the-supercar-edition/">expensive and pointless</a> car (because who cares about 0-60 when you’re gonna be doing 0-10 at most, and wearing out your left foot), and you think, “Hmmm, yes. I think my car could do with having a little more Fiat inserted up its nostrils.” So you start breathing down the neck of a tiny little 500 with a driver who clearly has yet to master indicators. Or the clutch. Or – worryingly – the handbrake.</p>
<p>It was worse with the second person I didn’t kill. That was me, by the way. It was a few weeks later, with the indicators now mastered but the elusive handbrake still outfoxing me at every turn. I turned right, as I am often instructed to do, and did NOT get rammed in the passenger side by on-coming traffic. I declared the turn a success, and exited the main road, entering the right-hand street, which had a rather steep gradient, almost hill-like in its ferocity.</p>
<p>At the top of the hill was a van.</p>
<p>We are all familiar with Van Man. He cat-calls with the firm conviction that he is somehow brightening up your day. He plays obnoxiously loud music and makes racist remarks, happy in the belief that he represents The Real England, whatever that might be. He also never – ever – gives way. Ever.</p>
<p>Spare a thought for the state of my pants when I saw Van Man accelerating down that hill towards me.</p>
<p>At my left was a car. At my right was a tiny narrow spare, then another car. Behind me was a busy main road. And in front of me was my rapidly-approaching death, in the form of a van so big it wouldn’t even see my tiny little Fiat before it squashed it like a bug. A small, white, L-plated bug.</p>
<p>At the very last second, when my eyes were like saucers and I was seriously regretting not having sorted that sodding will, he veered off into the tiny gap on my right. He didn’t even clip my car (although the car on the other side may not have been so lucky). By all accounts he didn’t even notice that he had nearly caused vehicular dismemberment.</p>
<p>“Well,” my instructor said brightly, after a horrifying and awkward pause, “shall we get on, then?”</p>
<p>Needless to say, I nearly burst into tears. “What the hell was that? That was like a cartoon death! I don’t want to die a cartoon death! I don’t want to be killed by a flying piano or a toilet seat, or a giant truck that doesn’t see me and runs me over!”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry,” my instructor soothed, looking a little rattled himself. “That sort of thing doesn’t actually happen in real life.”</p>
<p>That thought gave me pause. I wondered what, precisely, he thought we were doing right now. Maybe it was a rehearsal for real life? Maybe real motoring wouldn’t be like this. Maybe – and here was a horrifying possibility – it would be <em>worse.</em></p>

<p>It was.</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks I’ve had parking spaces stolen by aggressive BMWs that more or less manhandled me out of the way, I’ve nearly been killed by drivers doing 40 in a 20mph zone down a sodding bus lane during restrictions, I’ve nearly squashed toddlers that decided to run out into the middle of the road while their parents looked on, oblivious, and – worst of all – I once nudged the rear bumper of another car. It was at less than 1mph and left no physical mark whatsoever, but I maintain that the psychological scarring will stay with me.</p>
<p>My conclusion is this: you would have to be absolutely mad to want to drive in London. You have nowhere to park, and everywhere there are people that view red lights as simply suggestions, bus lanes as express lanes, and children as speed bumps. If you are a woman in a small car, every large car will attempt to physically crowd you off the road, and if you are a woman in a large car, everyone will hate you because you are clearly being overly aggressive in daring to get behind the wheel of something bigger than an armchair.</p>
<p>And yet.</p>
<p>I loved that stupid little Fiat. I called it Bertie, and the moment it was named, it leaped about like an eager little puppy. I did a little dance of triumph on discovering that my turns in the road were textbook-perfect, and that parallel parking really isn’t all that bad. True, my instructor was a closet sadist who decided to make things ‘more interesting’ by making me do obscenely complicated compound manoeuvres – reversing around a corner with obstacles and a time limit springs to mind – but once you choose to view the whole thing as an elaborate obstacle course, it’s fine. And the little Fiat 500 made me feel ridiculously proud of myself every time I got behind the wheel. Look at me, I’m <em>driving</em>!</p>
<p>It’s a shame it had to end. All things must, I suppose, but it made me tear up a little bit just the same to walk around to the passenger side and get in, knowing that this would be it. The thing about driving tests is, no one tells you that you don’t get to have any more lessons after you pass.</p>
<p>Bye bye, Bertie. You were a smart little car and you took a lot of abuse. I’ll come visit you over the summer for my advanced driving course.</p>
<p>In the meantime, though, I’m going to look up Bertie’s sexy two-wheel cousin and sit my <a href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Motoring/LearnerAndNewDrivers/RidingMotorcyclesAndMopeds/DG_4022430">CBT</a>.</p>
<p>After all, what’s the point of a driving license if you only get to drive cars? There’s a motorbike out there with my name on it.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I’ve just read a book on cars. It's called The Girls’ Car Handbook: Everything You Need to Know about Life on the Road. It was pink, and had a purple convertible on the cover.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve just read a book on cars. It&#8217;s called <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Girls-Car-Handbook-Everything-About/dp/1847392156"><strong>The Girls’ Car Handbook: Everything You Need to Know about Life on the Road</strong></a>. It was pink, and had a purple convertible on the cover.</p>
<p>On the surface of it, I am this book’s target audience. I passed my test recently (send plaudits and flowers to the usual address), and was immediately filled with the urge to run out and buy a car. Not a simple, sensible car that can lug my marshalling gear from racetrack to racetrack, or even a smart, neat little city runabout to get me to meetings on time. <a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/The-Girl-s-Car-Handbook-Everything-You-Need-to-Know-About-Life-on-the-Road1.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="6281" data-permalink="/2011/06/28/secret-diary-of-a-female-petrolhead-does-this-warranty-come-in-pink/the-girl-s-car-handbook-everything-you-need-to-know-about-life-on-the-road-2/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/The-Girl-s-Car-Handbook-Everything-You-Need-to-Know-About-Life-on-the-Road1.jpg?fit=261%2C420&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="261,420" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="The-Girl-s-Car-Handbook-Everything-You-Need-to-Know-About-Life-on-the-Road" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/The-Girl-s-Car-Handbook-Everything-You-Need-to-Know-About-Life-on-the-Road1.jpg?fit=186%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/The-Girl-s-Car-Handbook-Everything-You-Need-to-Know-About-Life-on-the-Road1.jpg?fit=261%2C420&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-6281" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/The-Girl-s-Car-Handbook-Everything-You-Need-to-Know-About-Life-on-the-Road1.jpg?resize=261%2C420" alt="Cover of the Girls Car Handbook, illustrated with a purple convertible.

It’s not even out yet. They&#8217;re only making a handful of them, and they&#8217;ve probably all already been sold. I wouldn’t be able to afford the deposit, let alone the monthly repayments, let alone the insurance, let alone keeping it fed and watered on UK oil prices. It’s not a car, it’s petrolhead pornography.</p>
<p>Couple the above unnatural lust with a penchant for heels and pearls, and surely I would jump for joy at a book with a back cover featuring a girl in a miniskirt and thigh-high purple boots bending over a car? Why, add a tasteful hair accessory or two and it could even be me!</p>
<p>Anyway, the pertinent point is that I did indeed read it (albeit borrowed from the library rather than sending my hard-earned cash to the pink publisher). Not just little bits. The whole damn thing, cover to cover. And I hate to say it, but I think the writer has been stitched up.</p>
<p>I’ve read <strong>Maria McCarthy</strong>’s columns in the <strong>Telegraph</strong>, and went in, despite the cover, expecting much the same: sensible journalism with an eye to problems faced by female drivers. It&#8217;s&#8230; not that. It&#8217;s actually rather like  – and when I say ‘like’, I mean ‘this is what I reckon happened&#8217; – someone took McCarthy’s manuscript, looked at the proposed cover, and said, “this should have more ‘girlie’ things in it.” And then picked up the editing pen and wrote in said girlie things, whether they made sense or not.</p>
<p>For example, McCarthy opens her chapter on car insurance thus:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Sorting out car insurance can be a bewildering experience for many of us.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Except she doesn’t. What actually opens the chapter, in full, is:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>As far as disagreeable but necessary obligations go, sorting out your car insurance is right up there with filling in tax returns, going for gynaecological check-ups or visiting dreary in-laws. But as with all these experiences, the best approach is just to grit your teeth, remind yourself that it’ll be over soon and plan a nice treat for afterwards.</em><br />
<em>Sorting out car insurance can be a bewildering experience for many of us.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, that’s right. It reads like someone went back in and added in an additional, wholly unnecessary introductory paragraph. It doesn’t stop there. On choosing a new garage:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>It’s a bit like trying out a new hairdresser – you’d probably go in for a trim or maybe a few highlights first and check out the way the hairdresser worked before asking to have your waist-length chestnut hair transformed into a blonde urchin cut.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>On using car magazines to research a car before buying:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Unlike <strong>Autotrader</strong>, which feels like something your dad might read, <strong>What Car?</strong> is an attractive glossy that’s easy to flick through when you’re having your highlights done.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>On washing your car:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>If you want to experience the Middle England lifestyle to the full then you’ll hand-wash your car every Sunday morning. If you want to live out your boyfriend’s fantasy then you’ll do it wearing your bikini while he watches, nursing a cold beer.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>And this from a writer who recently wrote about the benefit of <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/road-safety/8421336/Refresher-driving-courses.html">PassPlus courses for older female drivers returning to the road after a separation or bereavement</a>.</p>
<p>Or is it? Because the thing is, I’m not convinced the above extracts of pink vomit are actually McCarthy at all. Maybe, at a stretch, it&#8217;s McCarthy under duress; McCarthy with a metaphorical editorial gun to her head to make the book more appealing to young women browsing in Waterstones. Certainly the ridiculous inserts drop off mid-way through the book, and by the time you’re on Chapter 8 (presumably having shelled out the £7.99) with a car in your driveway and insurance to secure, they’re largely gone.</p>
<p>The question is, why on earth are they there in the first place? The book is screamingly successful, rated 10,102 in Amazon (which is pretty impressive for a specialist manual). Once you get past the purple passages it’s also – whisper it – really rather good. It has typical labour rates in major cities in the UK. It has suggested insurers if you want to be added to someone else’ insurance and still rack up a no-claims. It has helpful suggestions on how to avoid being ripped off when buying a used car. All of these things are useful for any novice, and I was making notes whilst reading. No wonder it has garnered such glowing reviews!</p>
<p>And yet… click on the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Girls-Car-Handbook-Everything-About/dp/1847392156/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1306960556&amp;sr=8-1">Amazon page</a>. Go on, I’ll wait. Click on it and scroll down to <em>Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought</em>, and tell me that at first glance you didn’t think they were showing you little girls’ toys. <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Pink-Car-Wash-Kit/dp/B0029U2L10/ref=pd_sim_b_3">The Pink Car Wash Kit</a>. <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Think-Pink-SWTP3-Fluffy-Furry/dp/B000TNHEE8/ref=pd_sim_b_6">The Pink Fluffy Furry Dice</a>. <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Pink-Toolbox-PTC031-Boot-Buddy/dp/B002ALMQTU/ref=pd_sim_b_7">The Pink Toolbox</a>.</p>
<p>I have a strong feeling that if Maria McCarthy is ever presented with any of these items and told to change a tyre, the pink wrench from the pink toolbox will disintegrate the first time it is used. The pink car wash kit will be useless in actually washing a car, unless used when wearing a bikini, and the pink fluffy furry dice will distract her from safely driving her lovely new Alfa 4C and she will plough it into the back of a horsebox on the M4, whereupon everyone passing will tut and say under his breath, “bloody lady drivers.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A while ago I popped down to the post office to collect a large parcel. Inside the cardboard box, nestled amidst plastic frames more akin to Airfix than to heavy machinery, were around 150 separate parts that the instructions promised would fit together into a workable model of an internal combustion engine. This model would be step one in <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/category/toolbox/">the great <em>Let’s Rebuild an Engine! </em>project of 2011</a> in our BadRep household.</p>
<p>I had already recruited one colleague to help with the eventual engine rebuild, and she would therefore be present for the assembly of the model. The instructions promised that a 10-year-old would be able to put this together with a little adult supervision. Surely that meant that two 20-somethings should be able to manage it?</p>
<p>Of course, prior to assembly, we had to purchase a few things that did not come as standard in the kit. The first was batteries. The second was beer.</p>

<p>Alcohol and batteries thus acquired, we put in our takeaway order and opened up the box. Out spilled plastic heaven. A million fiddly parts attached to plastic frames, with tiny numbers on the frames indicating the part numbers. The manual would instruct us on how to assemble it. It also named all the parts, so hopefully we would learn the names of at least some of the moving bits and pieces by the end.</p>
<p>Things started off pretty well. We had <strong>Top Gear</strong>’s Africa adventure on the telly and the pistons/crankshaft assembly in the cylinder block, and the pistons made satisfying up-down movements when you turned the crankshaft. The instructions said that you needed sanding paper to get the edges of the plastic smooth, but as we lacked sandpaper we made do with nail files, which seemed to do the trick. The whole thing turned so smoothly that we didn’t even need the vegetable oil to make it work.</p>
<p>“This would be even better if it was the right size,” I said as the plastic innards were slowly swallowed up inside the model.</p>
<p>“That would be much more satisfying,” Colleague X agreed, trying to get the tiny screw to stay perched atop the tiny screwdriver, and slot the entire thing into the tiny hole on the side of the crankcase. “This feels more like keyhole surgery.”</p>
<p>“Which is also important.”</p>
<p>“Yes. But not the sort of thing I had in mind when I bought the six-pack.”</p>
<p>I, too, was getting a little restless. Earlier that week I had opened my planner to try to book a last-minute meeting with a senior colleague. He, peering over my shoulder, wanted to know what “Engine Build” was referring to, and why it had so many exclamation marks. I attempted to explain.</p>
<p>“Hmmm,” he said, frowning. “Yes, interesting. But an engine’s a big commitment. Did you think about starting with something a little smaller?”</p>
<p>A motorcycle? Sure. Ultimately, though, I’d decided on the engine, because I was learning to drive a car, not a bike.</p>
<p>“No, not a motorcycle,” he said, just as thoughtfully. “Something smaller. A lawnmower, maybe, or a hairdryer.”</p>
<p>I very pointedly did NOT stab him with his own pen, but instead said that we were doing a model version first.</p>
<p>“Yes,” he said. “I think that’s probably for the best.”</p>
<p>Anyway, other than patience and tact when faced with senior people and their hairdryer suggestions, what did I learn from doing this little side-project?</p>
<p>Firstly, it’s bloody cool. There’s now a little engine model on a shelf in my living room, and if you press the little button it lights up and makes happy engine noises.</p>
<p>Secondly, the instructions may well be wrong. Try the different bits together until they fit. This will probably be more useful that memorising engine layouts.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the reviews and advertising for this product piss me off something chronic. “<a title="Amazon review" href="//www.amazon.co.uk/Haynes-Combustion-Engine/dp/B0045RAJ14/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1297713005&amp;sr=8-7">Ideal for a dad and son project</a>,” one proclaims. Well, yes, it is, but it’s also ideal for a dad-and-daughter and mum-and-son project. Or mum-and-daughter. It’s basically model assembly, and doing this with a kid (without taking over and finishing it off yourself) would probably take an afternoon.</p>
<p>Fourthly, the rocker arm assembly fits on top of the valves and the camshaft, and there’s only one correct way of lining up all the cams on the camshaft. There is no obvious way of knowing what that way is without having them labelled in alphabetical order. (This may require a textbook. Or a mechanic.)</p>
<p>Finally, although doing the plastic model was fun, it is limited in several major areas. It is extremely simplified, for one thing. The water-pump is two bits of plastic moulded and snapped together. The ‘sparkplugs’ are tiny Christmas tree lights that light up according to the position of the crankshaft (so the position does have to be correct, and the wiring is a bit tricky, but it’s not actually how a spark plug works). The dipstick is a completely pointless clip-on piece of plastic that looks like a Barbie accessory, and I still have no idea what it does (although presumably you dip it in things).</p>

<p>You also get the feeling that filing tiny bits of plastic with a nail file is not precisely what engine maintenance is all about. (Although it may well involve nail files. At this stage I have no way of knowing.) Assembling the model did make me more familiar with a lot of the parts, and I think I understand the fundamentals. But it felt a bit… delicate. A lot of the parts were so tiny that you had to hold them by the tips of your fingers, and slot them into place using your nails. It’s the same problem as following a textbook: it’s too clean. I didn’t start this wanting to stay in my living room, with clean fingers and a perfect working model completed in a couple of hours. I want something that will take months and leave me exhausted and exasperated and absolutely triumphant when it is in fact finished.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Explain to me about supercars.  No, seriously. If anyone out there has a clue, please write in and explain to me how anyone can consider them ‘cool’. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Explain to me about supercars.</p>
<p>No, seriously. If anyone out there has a clue, please write in and explain to me how anyone can consider them ‘cool’. Now, I like a<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercar"> supercar</a> as much as the next person.  Wait, scratch that. How can I say I like it? I’ve never driven a supercar. I’ve never touched one. I’ve never even seen one in real life close up. (I will obviously have to make an effort at the next motorshow.) So how can I categorically state: yup, that one there, that’s the one for me, the one with the bright orange paintjob and the rotating guns mounted on the spoiler?</p>
<p>I realise <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/03/04/secret-diary-of-a-female-petrolhead-%E2%80%93the-water-cooler-test/">I’ve just finished telling you</a> that I am really quite partial to the <a href="http://www.paganiautomobili.it/zonda/zonda_R/default.aspx">Zonda R</a>, but that’s more of an abstract sort of love. I love it like I love Dali – I’ve no idea what’s going on with it, and would feel vaguely disturbed if I did. But to stand up and say, yup, I’d love to own one? No.</p>
<div id="attachment_3335" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/pagani-zonda-r-supercar-14.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3335" data-attachment-id="3335" data-permalink="/2011/03/18/secret-diary-of-a-female-petrolhead-the-supercar-edition/pagani-zonda-r-supercar-14/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/pagani-zonda-r-supercar-14.jpg?fit=800%2C500&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="800,500" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="And then it melted." data-image-description="&lt;p&gt;And then it melted.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>And yet, despite that, I’m having to wage battles over whether or not the <a href="http://www.lotuscars.com/en/lotus-exige">Exige</a> – or the <a href="http://www.koenigsegg.com/cars/agera/">Agera</a>, or the <a href="http://www.astonmartin.com/thecars/one77">One-77</a> – is cool, uncool or just too uncool for words. My logic, for anyone who is interested, is this: <em>if it looks like it’s something a City banker would drive without a hint of irony, there are no words for how uncool it is. </em>Give it up now.</p>
<p>Actually, I don’t see why I should be having this argument at all, because it’s my fridge, and my fridge magnets, and if I decide to have the Exige in the <a href="http://topgear.cloudapp.net/default.aspx">Uncool</a> section, on my own head be it. And still, out it came – “but look at it! It looks like the Batmobile!”</p>
<p>There is, I suspect, a significant difference between engine enthusiasts and car enthusiasts. Both care about what the car has under the bonnet, but the car enthusiasts also care about <a href="http://www.venomgt.com/gallery/x1-top-gear-magazine/">whether or not it looks like a Batmobile</a>. Whereas I actively gravitate towards non-Batmobile cars (they don’t go with my handbag).</p>
<p>Anyway, the point is, I’ve now had a few driving lessons, and have therefore been thinking about what car I would hypothetically buy once I pass my driving test (and before I move to my castle, complete with moat). Meanwhile, my instructor was telling me to stop giving way to people (why? They were busy and going somewhere, whereas I was driving in circles!) and hold my ground. I had to stop being so cooperative, otherwise I would be &#8216;forever taken advantage of&#8217;.</p>
<p>While I was thinking about being less cooperative, I was cut up by a bloke driving a royal blue Ferrari. I can’t swear as to the model, due to the extreme speed at which he almost ran me off the road, but its sloping front looked rather like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrari_Daytona">Ferrari Daytona</a>. Suffice to say I was rather surprised to see one in Clapham, and even more surprised to nearly have it embed itself in the side of the <a href="http://www.fiat.co.uk/showroom/?id=10023#showroom/new_500">Fiat 500</a> I was desperately trying not to stall.</p>
<p>Ah, I thought. <em>That</em> is what I’m supposed to do. That raw, unbridled aggre-</p>
<p>“Was that the same Ferrari I saw on the roundabout a few minutes ago?” my instructor asked. I wouldn’t know, since at the time I was trying to remember which turn I was meant to be taking. But if so &#8211;</p>
<p>“Why is that bloke driving around pointlessly?”</p>
<p>As several Very Busy Persons behind me decided to improve my driving skills by honking their horns and pointing out that I should have allowed the Daytona-alike and my little Fiat to merge rather than braking and therefore delaying them by 3.4 seconds, I pondered the problem of the supercar. Even a Ferrari seemed a little pointless in South London. Surely anyone who drove one would either have to buy their own corner of Monte Carlo, or would otherwise have to face running for a pint of milk in something that looks like it should ram other cars for daring to share road space.</p>

<p>I’m going to have to decline. I’d much rather drive something that didn’t automatically make people hate me from miles away.</p>
<p>I’ve settled on an Alfa 166. No, it&#8217;s not a supercar.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s better.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to X &amp; Y Communications, an agency (apparently) specialising in the impact of gender differences on business, <a title="Daily Telegraph: What Do Women Want From Cars" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/columnists/neil-lyndon/8294019/What-do-women-want-from-cars.html" target="_blank"> women ask themselves one fundamental question</a> when contemplating the  purchase of a car. Is it the price?, I hear you wonder. Is it the safety  rating, or the fuel efficiency?</p>
<p>No. It&#8217;s: <em>&#8220;Will it make me look hotter when I step out of it outside a bar or restaurant?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Yes, the main thing that will make a woman decide on a particular car is how &#8216;hot&#8217; she feels in it. <strong>Telegraph</strong><em> </em>writer  Neil Lyndon &#8211; bemoaning the fact that his wife&#8217;s friend opted  for a car she liked and he deemed useless &#8211; goes on to tell us all about the new  Citroën DS3, decorated by graphic artist <a title="Orla Kiely" href="http://www.orlakiely.com/uk/" target="_blank">Orla Kiely</a>.  Now you really will be able to match your car to your handbag. Isn&#8217;t  that snazzy, girls? All your tricksy car decisions solved by this one  simple, fashionable step!</p>

Image (c) CarsRoute.com</p></div>
<p>According to Lyndon, his wife&#8217;s divorced friend ignored all sensible, practical considerations when making her car choice, and simply went for a pretty French hatchback. Because that&#8217;s what women do, of course: we go for the pretty option despite it possibly being on fire.</p>
<p>The thing is &#8211; and this will come as no surprise to those familiar with his prior work &#8211; Lyndon is talking complete twaddle. According to AutoEbid.com&#8217;s <a title="AutoEbid.com's Help Me Choose a New Car" href="http://www.autoebid.com/help-me-choose.asp">Help Me Choose a New Car</a> function, you can choose from six factors when trying to find the perfect car for you. They are: Comfort, Styling, Handling, Depreciation, Economy, and Safety. The price is a liming criterion: the thing that helps you to narrow your choice, rather than the main principle of selection. In fact, unless you are going into the market with an extremely limited amount of money, the cost of the car will only ever help you to select a class, or possibly a financing option. Put it another way: no one will switch from a brand-new Fiat 500 to a second-hand Volvo XC90, even though both can be had for roughly £10k.</p>
<p>So how do people choose cars, then, if it&#8217;s not the price?</p>
<p>1. First and foremost, functionality. What are you going to use the car for? If you have five children that will need running to school every morning, you will probably end up with that Volvo. If, on the other hand, you&#8217;re looking for an urban runabout, something small and easy to park is probably better.</p>
<p>2. Up there as a consideration is styling: you want it to look good. In fact, certain TV shows have gone so far as to have an entire segment over whether <a title="The Cool Wall" href="http://topgear.cloudapp.net/default.aspx">a car is &#8216;cool&#8217; or not</a>. The guide there, by the way, is whether a cool person would drive it. Perhaps X &amp; Y Communications neglected to canvas the Top Gear audience in their research.</p>
<p>3. The last, all encompassing question is: I live with it? This includes things like reliability, fuel economy, ability to park it in London, whether the suspension will destroy your spine the first time you drive over road-humps.</p>
<p>The &#8216;price&#8217; question helps to narrow your options, and, on occasion, to disabuse you of the notion that you really could afford to buy a supercar if you sell the house and both kidneys.</p>
<p>The key question Lyndon ignored was what his wife&#8217;s friend wanted in a car: she wanted a cute little urban runabout that would cheer her up in the mornings. Put simply, she wanted that &#8216;new car&#8217; feeling: you&#8217;ve chosen well, your car looks good, and you love it more than it is natural to love an inanimate object. If she was a man lovingly polishing his vintage (decrepit) Rolls, Lyndon would have smiled indulgently.</p>
<p>What Lyndon is bemoaning is not women&#8217;s tendency to pick cars that  make them look good &#8211; we all do that. No one has ever looked at a car and thought, &#8220;sure, it&#8217;s beautiful, but given the choice I&#8217;d go for the ugly, uncomfortable one on the left.&#8221;  Our budgets and priorities may vary, but the  intent remains the same. You buy the thing that makes you feel happy  when you&#8217;re inside it. Lyndon seems to have forgotten that, or have  momentarily blanked out all car adverts, ever. It&#8217;s such an established  cliché that car makers can now produce meta-tastic pastiches of previous  ads and we lap it up. Check out this Volvo V60 &#8220;How to make a sexy car  advert&#8221; clip:</p>

<p>When you sell a lifestyle, of course you&#8217;re going to sell a cool,  stylish one. Only a fool would try to market a boring car for boring  people.</p>

<p>Of course, that&#8217;s really the thing Lyndon is taking an issue with. <em>He</em> wanted his wife&#8217;s friend to go away and make a list of her  requirements, and bring back the top three cars that fulfilled them. He  would then counsel her to make the reasoned, practical decision. <em>She</em> wanted to buy a cool hatchback following a messy divorce. The thing is,  women going through messy divorces are not meant to want cool  hatchbacks. They&#8217;re not meant to want anything funky or stylish. They  should be worried about making ends meet, and where the rent is coming  from, and how they&#8217;re going to get to work now that their ex-husband has custody of the car. No divorced woman should want to look or feel  attractive, and she certainly shouldn&#8217;t be be gallivanting around bars or restaurants. I could choose this point to make a catty comment about how  Lyndon left his wife for another woman, <a title="No More Sex War" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/More-Sex-War-Neil-Lyndon/dp/0749315652/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1298924959&amp;sr=8-2">published a book </a>railing against  the &#8220;universal dominance of feminism&#8221; and has since been struggling to  rebuild his career.</p>
<p>Lyndon&#8217;s article reveals nothing about gender or, indeed, about car choice (and I highly doubt the odious Mr Lyndon chose his  own car based on a set of requirements and flowcharts). All it shows us is how deep his prejudices still lie: a woman who is hard up and urgently needs a car should not, in Lyndon&#8217;s  world, get to make that sort of choice. Having asked his advice, she  should have acknowledged his superiority and allowed him to select one  for her. After all, her preference for a &#8220;chic little French-made hatchback&#8221;  instantly indicated to him that she must not have the know-how to do it  herself.</p>
<p>And as for the Citroën DS3, the target of Lyndon&#8217;s ire: well, it&#8217;s not doing too badly, despite Lyndon&#8217;s contempt. It&#8217;s just been named <strong>Top Gear Magazine</strong>&#8216;s <a title="Top Gear Magazine 2010 Car of the Year" href="http://www.topgear.com/uk/photos/the-2010-top-gear-awards?imageNo=1">2010 Car of the Year</a>.</p>
