					<description><![CDATA[When The Hunger Games came out, we were faced with possibly the most ludicrous and yet most predictable controversy in recent film history: was Katniss Everdeen too fat?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Here&#8217;s a post from <a href="http://quiteirregular.wordpress.com/">Jem Bloomfield</a>. If you have an idea for a guest post brewing in your brain, email us: <a href="mailto:badrepeditors@gmail.com?subject=Guest pitch!">badrepeditors@gmail.com</a>.</strong></p>
<p><em>She’s just a hungry girl,<br />
In a post-apocalyptic wooooorld&#8230;</em></p>
<p>When <strong>The Hunger Games</strong> came out, we were faced with possibly the most ludicrous and yet most predictable controversy in recent film history: was Katniss Everdeen too fat? More specifically, was Jennifer Lawrence the wrong body-shape to play the protagonist of these phenomenally successful novels, as a number of critics and fans said? One quotation from the <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/2012/03/23/movies/the-hunger-games-movie-adapts-the-suzanne-collins-novel.html?pagewanted=2"><strong>New York Times</strong></a> can stand in for a lot of others:</p>
<blockquote><p>A few years ago Ms. Lawrence might have looked hungry enough to play Katniss, but now, at 21, her seductive, womanly figure makes a bad fit for a dystopian fantasy about a people starved into submission.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not going to answer the question, because, y’know. But I do want to talk about why the question matters, because it’s not something so ludicrous we can dismiss it.<sup><a href="/2012/07/10/guest-post-clothes-horse-of-the-apocalypse-katniss-dress-size-and-the-book-of-revelation/#footnote_0_11440" id="identifier_0_11440" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" Though it is ludicrous. Let no doubt be left about that. ">1</a></sup></p>
<div id="attachment_10433" style="width: 206px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Katniss.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10433" data-attachment-id="10433" data-permalink="/2012/03/22/a-hunger-games-guest-roundtable/katniss/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Katniss.jpg?fit=196%2C253&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="196,253" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Katniss" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Katniss.jpg?fit=196%2C253&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Katniss.jpg?fit=196%2C253&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-10433" title="Katniss" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Katniss.jpg?resize=196%2C253" alt="Artwork of Katniss Everdeen from the UK book release, showing a pale young woman looking determined." width="196" height="253" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-10433" class="wp-caption-text">Cover design for an early UK release of the Hunger Games, by Jason Chan</p></div>
<p>Essentially, these readers were arguing the case for realism. Katniss has access to limited calories (though more than some other people, due to her own skills) – this is part of the plot, theme and indeed title of the novel – so an actor of a certain body type might be less able to inhabit the role convincingly onscreen. Just as Renee Zellweger visibly put on some weight to play Bridget Jones<sup><a href="/2012/07/10/guest-post-clothes-horse-of-the-apocalypse-katniss-dress-size-and-the-book-of-revelation/#footnote_1_11440" id="identifier_1_11440" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" No, I know. It&rsquo;s not like I don&rsquo;t have a problem with that too, but it&rsquo;s awful in a slightly different way&hellip; ">2</a></sup>, Jennifer Lawrence was expected to appear strikingly underweight to embody the theme of the narrative. It’s a simple biological fact.</p>
<p>Except, of course, that fact assumes that the <strong>Hunger Games</strong> trilogy, beloved of teenage girls in particular, is taking place in a cultural vacuum. That it just happens to involve a young woman with a fraught relationship to food, who is contrasted to the decadence and self-indulgence of the inhabits of the Capitol and other characters. I’m absolutely not arguing that these are harmful books, or that they’re written thoughtlessly. Nor is it my place to tell young women how they should interact with art. But I am pointing out that novels don’t become popular for no reason, particularly YA novels with strong female leads.</p>

Again, there is an argument that the fictional situation happens to involve a character who would have a particular physical appearance. But that discourse of realism and “accuracy” totally ignores the hundreds of images which young women are bombarded with every day. It assumes that young women are never told they’re too fat or too skinny, that they lack self control or a sense of proportion, that their success in life is directly related to their dress size. It assumes that when actors like Jennifer Lawrence relax in between film-shoots, there aren’t packs of photographers with zoom-lenses feeding the websites which police their bodies and point out how they’ve “let themselves go”. Talk about “accuracy” is deeply naive because it ignores the way actors’ public personas are constructed, how their lifestyle is carefully confused with the roles they choose and how their bodies are used in advertising. It also ignores the power of performance to draw us into a fictional world and convince us of its reality, surely one of the main reasons anyone films a book in the first place.</p>
<p>So much for the hungry girl, but I don’t think we can ignore the post-apocalyptic world and its relevance to this controversy. Katniss isn’t just a young woman who finds herself short on nosh after the shops have shut, she’s the central figure in a futuristic wasteland. “Post-apocalyptic” has also come in for a bit of controversy recently, with Mark Kermode demanding with typically entertaining zeal that if the apocalypse is the end of the world, then how can a film be post-apocalyptic? If the apocalypse has happened, and there’s anything left to have a film about, then that my friend is a shoddy apocalypse and you want to demand another one, that works like it says on the packet. Highly pleasing as this is, and far be it from me to out-pedant the worshipful Doctor, but apocalypse does not mean the end of the world.</p>
<p>Apocalypse means “revelation” or the “lifting of the veil”. The book we get most of our apocalyptic imagery from – four horsemen, 666, Whore of Babylon riding on a seven-headed beast, you know the drill – is referred to as both the Apocalypse of St. John and the Book of Revelation. The fact that the most famous one is most frequently framed as a vision of the end of the world means that we tend to assume that they’re the same thing (if we’re not massive pedants and unhealthily obsessed with etymology &#8211; oh no, wait&#8230;). But the crucial aspect is the “lifting of the veil”, the revealing of a deeper reality which is obscured by the world around us.<sup><a href="/2012/07/10/guest-post-clothes-horse-of-the-apocalypse-katniss-dress-size-and-the-book-of-revelation/#footnote_2_11440" id="identifier_2_11440" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" The titles of The Vision of Ezra and the Sibylline Oracles &ndash; both around during the first centuries of Christianity though neither made it into the Bible(s) &ndash; underline this point. ">3</a></sup></p>
<p>I’m not bringing this up for the sake of sheer quibble (though that would be reason enough), but because I think a lot of post-apocalyptic fiction still has this original meaning embedded in it. So many post-apocalyptic films and novels have this sense of being not only “after the disaster” but also “after the revelation”, trying to strip back the complexities and confusions of modern life to get to what is basic and essential about us. In <strong>The Road</strong>, that’s the emotional bond between father and son, in <strong>Mad Max</strong> the depravity of humans as pack animals, in <strong>Escape From New York</strong> it’s a macho code of integrity.<sup><a href="/2012/07/10/guest-post-clothes-horse-of-the-apocalypse-katniss-dress-size-and-the-book-of-revelation/#footnote_3_11440" id="identifier_3_11440" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" And with more time we could read right back from Snake Plissken&rsquo;s tattoo to the Man With No Name, and wonder how much the classic Western is also driven by a desire to get its characters out into the oddly moonscapey deserts, to strip away the civilization. Or look at the fistfight between two astronauts which starts Tom Stoppard&rsquo;s Jumpers, suggesting that getting to the moon called earth morality into question&hellip; ">4</a></sup></p>
<p>And in <strong>The Hunger Games</strong> it’s a famished young woman. If a deeper reality is being revealed in this apocalypse, a profound truth about humanity which lies beneath the surface of modern life, then it’s one which looks very similar to the line peddled by fashion magazines, diet books and vast swathes of Hollywood’s output. That young women should look as if they’re slightly undernourished. The tendencies of post-apocalyptic fiction mean that this film risks holding that image up as not only an ideal to aspire to, but as the most “natural” and “essential” state for them to be in.</p>
<p>Again, this doesn’t make <strong>The Hunger Games</strong> a bad book or a bad film, but it means that the way Katniss Everdeen is portrayed onscreen cannot be reduced to a question of “accuracy” to a description in the book. A film which presents a teenage girl as the prototypical member of humanity is a wonderful idea – not least because she’s active, intelligent and fighting on behalf of her people &#8211; but this one sits at the intersection of some very powerful cultural influences which we can’t ignore.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The editor and two guest writers have a nice long chat about The Hunger Games. THE MOVIE IS COMING OUT VERY VERY SOON. WE NEEDED TO PASS THE TIME.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Less than a day to go to the UK release of the <a href="http://www.thehungergamesmovie.com/"><strong>Hunger Games</strong></a> movie, and frankly it&#8217;s difficult for some of us at BadRep Towers to go more than five minutes without starting a very excitable conversation about it. After spamming my personal Twitter feed so heavily even I began to feel slightly awkward, I dragged two interested parties &#8211; writer and <a href="http://www.denofgeek.com">Den of Geek</a> founder <a href="http://www.sarahdobbs.com/">Sarah Dobbs</a> and comics writer (and Starburst journo) <a href="http://www.starburstmagazine.com/reviews/comic-reviewscomics-a-graphic-novels">PM Buchan</a> &#8211; into a corner for an email-chat.</p>
<p>A few points before we go any further:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is us revisiting Suzanne Collins&#8217;s books, mainly, and looking at the characters we like, and how the books &#8211; for us &#8211; jigsaw with other franchises out there. Back in the mists of time, Team BadRep&#8217;s Jenni also <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/03/25/the-girl-who-was-on-fire-reviewing-the-hunger-games/">talked about the books on here</a> in a more spoiler-free, introductory way.</li>
<li><strong>SPOILER WARNINGS are all over this</strong>. Do not read this post if you want to read the books unspoilered.</li>
<li>Sarah&#8217;s been interviewing the cast of the movie over on <a href="http://www.denofgeek.com/">Den of Geek</a>, and you can read those posts <a href="http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/1285206/jennifer_lawrence_interview_the_hunger_games_playing_katniss_working_with_woody_harrelson_and_more.html">here</a>, <a href="http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/1285125/josh_hutcherson_interview_the_hunger_games.html">here</a>, and <a href="http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/1288785/elizabeth_banks_and_liam_hemsworth_interview_making_the_hunger_games_and_more.html">here</a>.</li>
<li>As Bucky and I haven&#8217;t seen the press screenings, we&#8217;ll maybe be back to talk about the movie later.</li>
</ul>
<h3>On Those Triangular Twilight Comparisons</h3>
<p><strong>Miranda:</strong> I made a blog post the other week <a href="http://www.sparksoflight.org.uk/2012/03/03/selling-revolution-the-hungermerch-problem/">elsewhere on the internets</a> about how the movie franchise is being merched, as far as I can tell, in a way which visually dovetails with a lot of Twilight merch, and the disappointment I feel around that. Nonetheless, Suzanne Collins&#8217;s bestselling trilogy is, I think, using the love triangle motif in an effective, nuanced way. So while the <strong>Twilight</strong> comparisons might be short-sighted, they&#8217;re not unreasonable. But what do my friends think?</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/HungerGamesPoster.jpg?resize=285%2C438" alt="poster for The Hunger Games. Katniss Everdeen's face (Caucasian, dark haired, young) in close up. She aims a bow. The slogan reads, THE WORLD WILL BE WATCHING. Image via Wikipedia, shared under Fair Use guidelines." width="285" height="438" data-recalc-dims="1" /><strong>Bucky:</strong> OK, so here&#8217;s my big confession: I sort of love <strong>Twilight</strong>. It&#8217;s the reading equivalent of eating popcorn, plus I&#8217;m a sucker for romance, which should be apparent in the fact that even the most depressing things I write <a href="http://buckychainsawmassacre.blogspot.co.uk/2011/12/apocalypse-romance.html">are always thinly-veiled love stories</a>. My beef with <strong>Twilight</strong> was the general mormon-propaganda shittiness. I could totally have gone for a general horror-lite romance WITHOUT the abominable gender politics and chastity stuff.</p>
<p>Throughout the first book, it was apparent that this wasn&#8217;t just going to be a vapid romance, which was fine and the nature of pitting them against each other sort of insisted that the romance be downplayed, but across the three books I was disappointed by the things that didn&#8217;t happen &#8211; when the action/adventure/1984 stuff took over the romantic hook was still what kept me reading!</p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> I think comparisons to <strong>Twilight</strong> are kind of irrelevant here, because they&#8217;re completely different stories in completely different genres. <strong>Twilight</strong> is a romance, and <strong>The Hunger Games</strong> is&#8230; well, anything but that. It&#8217;s an action/thriller/horror with strong anti-war sentiments, and I think reading The Hunger Games for the romance is doing it a massive disservice.</p>
<p>In particular, getting overly invested in the love triangle element is missing the point, because Gale and Peeta aren&#8217;t really individuals, they&#8217;re metaphors.</p>
<p><strong>Bucky:</strong> OK, I&#8217;ll give you that it&#8217;s an unfair comparison, but there&#8217;s no escaping the Love Triangle parallels, Collins just uses it as a device to much greater effect, rather than pinning an entire series of books on it.</p>
<h3>On the Boys</h3>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> Like I say, I think the boys are, in part, metaphors &#8211; Gale in particular, which is why the idea that <em>anyone</em> would declare themselves &#8220;Team Gale&#8221; utterly baffles me. Because what does Gale stand for? Anger. Revenge. He&#8217;s a hunter; he&#8217;s kind of Old Testament-y. He&#8217;s very black and white, and not very interested in forgiveness. He&#8217;s initially presented as having the most in common with Katniss: they have the same background, they live in the same area, they look like each other, they&#8217;re very close friends and their lives seem very similar. But even right at the beginning, she&#8217;s restraining him. He&#8217;s shouting about rebellion in the woods while she tries to calm him down and keep him safe. He just gets more violent as the books go on, and it&#8217;s his bombs that kill a bunch of innocent children. Gale is basically a terrorist, and his is no way to build a future.</p>
<p><strong>Bucky:</strong> I do like what you&#8217;re saying about Gale. I think all the main characters are realised brilliantly, because they&#8217;re people, compromised and damaged people with their own agendas, not pin-ups like they would be in <strong>Twilight</strong>. But I don&#8217;t feel like Collins had such a good handle on Gale&#8217;s character in the first book &#8211; I think his anger was hinted at but I don&#8217;t think she&#8217;d made the leap towards thinking that he&#8217;d become Anger, Vengeance etc &#8211; early on he still has the potential to be a romantic lead and not a product of his society. Peeta is pretty great, in retrospect. He&#8217;s a well created character.</p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> Yeah, Peeta is great. Peeta is so great. It&#8217;s not Gale that Katniss seeks out when she wants to feel safe, it&#8217;s Peeta. It&#8217;s easy to forget how strong he is, because he&#8217;s so warm and protective. But Collins makes sure &#8211; over and over again, especially in <strong>Mockingjay</strong> &#8211; that he needs to be protected, too. I don&#8217;t think I can quite forgive Gale for that line where he says Katniss will choose whichever of them she can&#8217;t survive without, because he&#8217;s wrong &#8211; she&#8217;ll pick whoever can&#8217;t survive without <em>her</em>, which is clearly Peeta. Peeta is preternaturally calm, loving, and forgiving (until the Capitol breaks him). I think it&#8217;s super important for them to be together at the end, because they&#8217;re the only ones who understand one another &#8211; and they make one another better. They&#8217;re different, but their differences make them better equipped to work towards a world that&#8217;s better than either the world they grew up in, or the one that Gale and President Coin want.</p>
<p>I think maybe the way Peeta gets broken in <strong>Mockingjay</strong> is the first time we really appreciate him for who he is. I dunno. I&#8217;m still thinking about this.</p>
<p><strong>Miranda:</strong> What d&#8217;you reckon about <a href="http://bitchmagazine.org/post/the-rebel-warrior-and-the-boy-with-the-bread-gale-peeta-and-masculinity-in-the-hunger-games">this piece over on Bitch</a>, about masculinity in the trilogy? I&#8217;m digging it.</p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> I like it too. I&#8217;m not keen on the view that Katniss isn&#8217;t a feminist heroine because she &#8220;ends up weak&#8221; at the end of the trilogy. YEAH ALRIGHT LET&#8217;S SEE YOU GO THROUGH WHAT SHE DOES AND SEE HOW BLOODY XENA-LIKE YOU ARE &#8211; I might love Katniss a bit too much. Hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Miranda:</strong> I thought it was interesting that they picked up on the &#8220;does she need to end up alone? How do feminists find romance in books now?&#8221; thing.</p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> Yeah &#8211; I mean, surely we&#8217;re not gonna claim that women can&#8217;t be in relationships with men and still be feminist? I think the happy ending, with all of its caveats, was necessary.</p>

<h3>&#8220;Like Joan of Arc&#8221;</h3>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> Katniss&#8217;s attitude to sex is worth thinking about, too. She&#8217;s almost completely sexless (unless we read between the lines a bit with all the many nights she spends sleeping in Peeta&#8217;s arms?) and just not really that interested in romance&#8230; but she explains that quite early on, I think, because it&#8217;s not a safe enough world that she&#8217;s ever really thinking beyond her next meal. I bloody love her, in exactly the same way I love Buffy and <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/04/07/found-feminism-%E2%80%9Cthings-starbuck-wouldn%E2%80%99t-say%E2%80%9D-by-katee-sackhoff/">Starbuck</a> and all those other tough-because-they-have-to-be women out there in sci-fi/fantasy.</p>
<p><strong>Bucky:</strong> I think it&#8217;s pretty awesome. I know I <em>wanted</em> romance, but it&#8217;s still cool that she just doesn&#8217;t have time in her life to care about &#8220;petty&#8221; stuff like that.</p>
<p><strong>Miranda: </strong>This whole area fascinates me. I think Katniss&#8217;s story engages with the issue of &#8216;sexless action heroines&#8217; really well. A lot of my early engagement with feminism came from a place where, sick of all the sexualising/objectifying/insert buzzword here, you know what I&#8217;m talking about &#8211; I constructed a sort of mental checklist for movies. It involved asking questions like &#8220;is the heroine SENSIBLY DRESSED?!&#8221; and &#8220;is she defined by her romantic attachments (usually to men)?&#8221; It was like Bechdel Plus.</p>
<p>I think these remain pertinent questions to ask, and I still ask them. But I also think I spent years mistrusting <em>any</em> heroine who dared to fall in love or wear a V-neck, just in case she was being somehow undermined from somewhere. It&#8217;s only recently I&#8217;ve begun to engage with heroines like Emma Frost, and also to confront the fact that &#8216;sexless heroines&#8217; can also feel quite limited in their own way, depending on how they&#8217;re written. Often I think we cite a heroine&#8217;s lack of sexual desires as evidence for her liberated awesomeness, but this can feel for me like a bit of a red herring, and one that&#8217;s still being driven, in a sense, by the same set of patriarchal restrictions.  The question about how to write &#8220;feminist romance&#8221; is therefore an interesting one.</p>
<p>Katniss directly faces off with these questions. The novels show her wrestling a load of societal pressure to live out a romantic narrative and define herself against one &#8211; her survival may depend on it. Uunderneath all that, she does struggle with genuine desires for Peeta and Gale, played out against a hugely traumatic backdrop.</p>
<p>I thought it was fascinating &#8211; she does find love, but it&#8217;s a struggle to get there in fair, real terms. I think Katniss &#8211; though Jennifer Lawrence describes her as a Joan of Arc figure in your interview &#8211; goes a lot further than many heroines in TVTropes&#8217;s <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JeanneDArchetype">Jeanne D&#8217;Archetype section</a> because we get to see that struggle played out, with all the paranoia over who&#8217;s controlling the narrative that that entails. She moves <em>through</em> a sexless phase, in the process taking on an entire system of oppression in order to discover how she really wants to express her desires, and how to be able to do that safely rather than it being a capitulation of any kind. These are books about <em>struggle, </em>personal <em>and</em> political.</p>

<h3>Revolution!</h3>
<p><strong>Bucky: </strong>I almost like the books more now that you&#8217;ve both pointed out the media and propaganda themes that I took for granted &#8211; they are, in hindsight, pretty strong ideas to sell to a teenage audience. I like to think that I&#8217;m quite media-savvy, but I guess that if I encountered this at a time in my life when I wasn&#8217;t then it might have raised some interesting questions.</p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> I do super-love that tension Miranda pointed out in her blog post, re: merchandising this franchise when it&#8217;s all about the evils of capitalism and in particular the way we exploit people in other countries. I think they should&#8217;ve gone with more Mockingjay &#8220;symbol of the rebellion&#8221; stuff, but in a way <a href="http://www.bellasugar.com/Hunger-Games-Nail-Polish-Available-March-1-2012-20377040">Capitol-themed makeup ranges</a> are perfectly apposite.</p>
<p><strong>Bucky: </strong>Yeah, the merchandising is insane, especially because propaganda is insanely merchandisable (by its very definition) so to ignore that angle and create &#8220;straight&#8221; merchandise like a Katniss barbie instead of &#8220;in-character&#8221; merchandise is just batshit.</p>
<h3>In Conclusion&#8230;</h3>
<p><strong>Bucky:</strong> The more I talk to you guys, the more I feel like it&#8217;s cool I enjoyed these books and all, but I&#8217;m not the person whose life this might make a difference to. I don&#8217;t need any more role models, but younger readers might benefit from Katniss and will almost certainly benefit from the way that she isn&#8217;t sexualised or defined by her relationships. So that&#8217;s pretty cool.</p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> I&#8217;ve  just got back from a press screening of the film. I think Gary Ross really really gets the political aspects of the book, and he&#8217;s really explicit about it, and there were at least two new bits he&#8217;d put in that made my jaw drop. <a href="http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/1283781/the_hunger_games_review.html">My review&#8217;s over here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Miranda:</strong> ONE DAY TO GO!</p>
