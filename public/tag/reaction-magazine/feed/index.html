<li><strong><a href="http://reactionblog.tumblr.com/">re/action magazine</a>: </strong>last week&#8217;s belated <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/12/02/five-things-i-found-at-ladyfest-ten/">dispatches from Ladyfest Ten</a> saw us rabbiting on about mags, zines and feminist-friendly readables.  Here&#8217;s another &#8211; <strong>re/action</strong> magazine, which launched at roughly the same time this fair blog did.  Our copy arrived this week, and the bumper debut issue&#8217;s definitely worth the fiver, clocking in at double the pagecount of yer average homegrown, with lots of longform articles. So far we&#8217;re impressed; proper review to follow!</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://drawthisdress.tumblr.com/">Draw This Dress</a></strong>:  now, this is gorgeous &#8211; vintage fashion lovers take note. Illustrators <a href="http://emcarroll.blogspot.com/"><strong>Em Carroll</strong></a> and  <a href="http://www.verabee.com/"><strong>Vera Brosgol</strong></a> have joined forces on this charming artblog.  The concept? Reversing the usual trajectory of design-drawing-to-fashion-photo, they find photos of outfits from bygone eras &#8211; usually on dressmaker dummies &#8211; and turn them back into vibrant drawings filled with character of the clothes being worn. What&#8217;s striking is how they reimagine the clothes on bodies of different sizes &#8211; clicking through to see the photographs that inspired the art, one sees the same base mannequin shape, but the artwork showcases women (well, so far it&#8217;s all women) across a nice range of body shapes. We particularly dig <a href="http://drawthisdress.tumblr.com/post/2079059845/fashion-from-not-so-old-people-in-this-case">this sultry lady in 80s stripes</a>, this <a href="http://drawthisdress.tumblr.com/post/1729623439/evening-dress-c-1920-via-defunctfashion">curvaceous Twenties flapper girl</a>, the <a href="http://drawthisdress.tumblr.com/post/1729489169/ensemble-c-1798-via-defunctfashion">late 18th century lady having a good brow-furrowing scheme</a>, and the<a href="http://drawthisdress.tumblr.com/post/1730840562/wool-coat-1942-from-the-v-a-click-to-see"> &#8220;come on then, impress me!&#8221; Forties work-chic bombshell</a>.  </li>
<li> <a href="http://butthenfeminismhappened.blogspot.com/"><strong>But Then Feminism Happened</strong></a><strong>:</strong> it&#8217;s actually about loos, but stay with me here; it&#8217;s a <em>photo-blog documenting the under-represented art of toilet graffiti. Confessional, inspirational, humorous, slanderous and anonymous. Locked away in the privacy of a stall, what would you write? Read the wise and witty words scrawled on toilet walls around the world, written by women, for women.</em> And if you&#8217;ve spotted any good examples on your travels yourself, you&#8217;re encouraged to submit your own pics to the grand collage of privy-wall scrawls (we sent one in the other week).  <a href="http://butthenfeminismhappened.blogspot.com/2010/03/groupies-are-so-90s.html">This is my favourite. </a>I also like <a href="http://butthenfeminismhappened.blogspot.com/2010/02/introduction-to-subtle-graceful-art-of.html">the one in the first post. Birrrrds. </a></li>
<li>Behold the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2010/nov/21/royal-society-lost-women-scientists"><strong>Lost Women of the Royal Society</strong></a>. Says Richard Holmes: <em>&#8220;&#8230; my re-examination of the Royal Society archives during this 350th  birthday year has thrown new and unexpected light on the lost women of  science. I have tracked down a series of letters, documents and rare  publications that begin to fit together to suggest a very different  network of support and understanding between the sexes. It emerges that  women had a far more fruitful, if sometimes conflicted, relationship  with the Royal Society than has previously been supposed.&#8221;</em></li>
