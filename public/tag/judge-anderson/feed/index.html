										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Team BadRep were put on the spot again this month: in the wake of <a href="http://dcwomenkickingass.tumblr.com/post/7985599811/panels">SDCC Batgirl</a> igniting the gender-and-comics conversation loud &#8216;n&#8217; proud, the team were asked to take a look at their favourite comic book titles and characters &#8211; some obvious choices, some less so&#8230; and next up, we have Steve.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>There wasn&#8217;t a specific comic which made me look at the female lead and think &#8220;<em>Girls can be heroes just as well as guys! I should be for equality, and stuff.</em>&#8221; That doesn&#8217;t mean there weren&#8217;t loads of characters who fit the bill, only that I never looked on them that way. Which could be the whole point&#8230;</p>
<p>I got into comics pretty late, and mostly with UK releases instead of Marvel or DC. I think it started when an older friend had spent 2 straight hours laughing himself onto the floor at Alan Moore and Alan Davis&#8217; &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D.R._%26_Quinch"><strong>DR &amp; Quinch</strong></a>&#8220;. (They STILL get asked to do more of that one.) I suppose that technically DR&#8217;s girlfriend <a href="http://britishcomics.wikia.com/wiki/Crazy_Chrissie">Crazy Chrissie</a> is an empowered and independent woman, but since she spends much of her time firing guns and/or throttling him, it&#8217;s hard to tell. It&#8217;s a great book though, especially the incredibly sensitive war poetry.</p>

<p><strong>2000 AD</strong> was (and still is) an important publication in the UK. It hurt like hell when I finally stopped buying it (around the age of 18 and at university, I think). It also produced a far more relevant female character for this post: <strong>Judge Anderson</strong>. I was mostly oblivious to Judge Dredd&#8217;s satire on future fascism, so all I knew was that Anderson was a determined, skilled woman who could do everything Dredd could (shout, kick doors, shoot things) but also more. She had the psi-powers side of it as well, and her storylines just seemed fuller to me. The telepathy element allowed for more of a detective story, and the others in Psi-Division such as Empaths brought in some very murky subtlety at times. There was no hint of her being less physically capable than a male Judge (although Dredd in particular is something of an unstoppable juggernaut) so my decision was completely based on which characters I got more from. (This priority of &#8216;story over gender&#8217; was reflected in my affection for another <strong>2000AD</strong> series, Pat Mills&#8217; enjoyably bonkers <strong>Finn</strong>, which starred a <em>male</em> witch.) Anderson is still incredibly popular, and will feature in the <A href="http://2000ad.wordpress.com/2011/07/25/another-karl-urban-pic-and-the-first-of-olivia-thirlby-as-judge-anderson/" />new Judge Dredd movie currently in production</a>.</p>
<p>In my all-time Top 10 individual graphic novels, Neil Gaiman&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death:_The_High_Cost_of_Living"><strong>Death: The High Cost of Living</strong></a> will always feature highly. Technically very few of the female characters in the Sandman tales are actually human, and those in the Endless family such as Death, Delirium and Despair certainly not, but it is a remarkable book. There&#8217;s no question that Death herself is where all the focus is, as she steals the show from her brother Dream even in the main Sandman storylines which are supposedly about him.</p>
<p>We recently linked to Greg Rucka and Rick Burchett&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://www.ineffableaether.com"><strong>Lady Sabre and the Pirates of the Ineffable Aether</strong></a>&#8221; (starring LADY SKYSHIP PIRATES), but Rucka was on my radar long before. His series <strong>Queen and Country</strong> stars Tara Chace, who in my view is about as feminist a character as can exist (hard-drinking, flawed, MI6 operative in a man&#8217;s world) &#8211; <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/11/04/queen-and-country/">we have a post about her here</a>. It was another graphic novel which caught my attention though, when he took over a superhero who was originally arguably one of the least feminist-friendly ever: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elektra_%28comics%29">Elektra</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_6562" style="width: 207px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Elektra_20.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6562" data-attachment-id="6562" data-permalink="/2011/08/04/badrep-challenge-response-feminist-characters-in-comics/elektra_20/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Elektra_20.jpg?fit=366%2C555&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="366,555" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Elektra_20" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Elektra_20.jpg?fit=197%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Elektra_20.jpg?fit=366%2C555&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-6562" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Elektra_20-197x300.jpg?resize=197%2C300" width="197" height="300" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Elektra_20.jpg?w=197&amp;ssl=1 197w, https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Elektra_20.jpg?w=366&amp;ssl=1 366w" sizes="(max-width: 197px) 100vw, 197px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-6562" class="wp-caption-text">Elektra, somehow managing to show off her chest and rear. Again. Copyright Marvel comics, image from http://marvel.wikia.com/.</p></div>
<p>Seriously, even quite recently before Rucka&#8217;s volume <strong>Everything Old is New Again</strong>, she was aimed at a fanbase who wanted her to look like the image here. She&#8217;s the Sexy! Killer! Babe! In Red! So far, so very <A href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/01/19/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-the-frank-miller-effect-strikes-again/" />sex assassin</a>, as we call it around here.</p>
<p>In Rucka&#8217;s storyline however, things get shaken up a bit. Elektra has got too used to the endless killing, and is almost at a point where she can&#8217;t recover psychologically. She meets a new sensei who is the other main character of the book&#8230; an older woman of colour. That&#8217;s right, the most dangerous warrior in this story &#8211; more capable and badass than the famously lethal assassin herself &#8211; is a non-white woman of advancing years, and she is also the one with all the intelligence and wisdom. The art (in the early episodes at least) is superb, with a fight between them showing convincing movement and how muscles actually work. It also heralded a change from CombatBarbie visuals. Rucka had just previously produced <strong>Elektra/Wolverine: The Redeemer</strong> with esteemed Japanese artist Yoshitaka Amano, where the <a href="http://yoshitaka-amano.kouryu.info/gal-eng-comics-elektra_wolverine-p-1.html">glorious full-page paintings</a> showed a stylised Elektra with a body which was often much less objectified than typical comic fare. (Amano&#8217;s site doesn&#8217;t have my favourite pages from towards the end of the book, where Elektra is shown exhibiting the kind of power and savagery usually given to an avatar of an avenging death goddess, in some very powerful images.)</p>
<p><strong>Everything Old is New Again </strong> frequently surprised me, since earlier chapters of this character had basically been SexyNinja books (I knew Greg Rucka would be doing more with it though). I wasn&#8217;t thinking outwardly about feminism, I was just being pulled along by the adrenaline and drama of the story. </p>
<p>And that&#8217;s the secret. That&#8217;s why pop culture is such a great partner for feminism: we don&#8217;t notice that it&#8217;s happening. It&#8217;s why the first <strong>Matrix</strong> film is a classic, but no matter how many motifs and clever philosophies the sequels pack in, they still fail to inspire. They will never get people thinking to the same extent as the original did because <em>the audience is bored</em> (and disappointed, if you&#8217;re me). Grab your reader&#8217;s/viewer&#8217;s attention and you can push your message home very effectively.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have one particular comic or character which made me stop and think YEAH FEMINISM, but I suspect there are many which slipped in under my radar and connected strongly, which is a great thing too.</p>

To get us started, why don&#8217;t you tell us a bit about <em>Róisín Dubh </em>, which has just gone on release.</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://roisindubhcomic.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Róisín Dubh</strong></a> is a three-issue comic book series that will also be collected and bound as a graphic novel. It&#8217;s set in Ireland in 1899 and follows the adventures of Róisín Sheridan, an eighteen-year-old woman who harbours ambitions to be an actress. Her life is altered forever when she and her parents are attacked on the road by a bloodthirsty man called Abhartach who has just risen from the earth. Róisín&#8217;s parents are killed and she is left for dead&#8230; until she is given a mission by ancient powers. She has to go against the conventions of the day, and her previous notions of what is possible, to try and put Abhartach back in the ground&#8230; but the person who raised Abhartach from his 1,400-year stasis has other plans.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>What might feminist readers enjoy about the comic? As if an Irish suffragette killing demons isn&#8217;t enough to get anyone interested&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I hope there&#8217;s plenty there for everyone, but the women&#8217;s suffrage movement was on my mind from the start. Róisín has had a liberal, educated upbringing, she was allowed a lot of leeway as a child, but as a woman she&#8217;s starting to discover that there are more limits on her than she imagined.</p>
<p>For instance, that simple thing her father says to her: <a href="http://roisindubhcomic.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/rd1-1-3new1.jpg"><em>of course women should have the right to vote&#8230; but a career on the stage? It&#8217;s disreputable.</em> </a>The struggle for equal rights is a slow erosion of the <em>but</em>s. People are always full of reasons why you can have some rights, but not all.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why Róisín has a bike. People forget that the bicycle was a huge boon to women in the nineteenth century &#8211; it gave them a freedom of movement that they didn&#8217;t enjoy previously, and it also helped bring about a change in clothing.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_B._Anthony">Susan B. Anthony</a> said in 1896 that she thought the bicycle &#8216;has done more to emancipate women than anything else in the world, It gives a woman a feeling of freedom and self-reliance. The moment she takes her seat she knows she can&#8217;t get into harm unless she gets off her bicycle, and away she goes, the picture of free, untrammeled womanhood.'&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>What sort of heroine is Róisín &#8211; who is she as a character? Which other comic book heroines have inspired you in the past and what do you like about them?</strong></p>

The events in the comic book means she&#8217;s forced to deal with tragedy while learning she has far less control over her life. These are the kinds of lessons we often learn in life, although in Róisín&#8217;s case they involve an undead creature, magicians and ancient Irish divinities!</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t drawn upon any other comic book heroines consciously in relation to Róisín, but there were a number that had an impact upon me over the years. First was Judge Anderson in <strong>2000 AD</strong>. I didn&#8217;t read many American comics when I was growing up in Ireland as there weren&#8217;t many available at the time. <strong>2000 AD</strong> was the premiere title for young teens then, so I read it too. Her first appearance in the Judge Death storyline (written by John Wagner and drawn by Brian Bolland) ticked all the boxes for me: horror and a great female lead.</p>
<p>What I loved about Anderson was her humour. She was the only one who poked fun at Dredd, and I loved that the Psi-Division were given loads of leeway because of the job they did and the high risk of their brains being fried in the process. Plus, she saves the world through an extreme act of self-sacrifice (thankfully, she didn&#8217;t remain in stasis forever!).</p>
<p>A while ago I read a comment on a website by one of the early artists of Anderson, in which he said he thought that she wasn&#8217;t very complex and was created for a bit of titillation for the lads. That comment disappointed me greatly. I guess he didn&#8217;t realise that Anderson was one of the <em>very few</em> women in <strong>2000 AD</strong> at the time, and for that reason alone she had a big impact on the girls/women who read the series. Having a representation of women in comics book series is really important, and Dredd himself is not exactly the most complex character! I don&#8217;t usually hanker after writing particular characters, but writing Anderson would be a dream project.</p>
<p>Another character that had a big impact was <strong>Tank Girl</strong> (Jamie Hewlett and Alan Martin). She had a punk sensibility and a sense of humour, and liked sex, drugs and driving a tank &#8211; what was not to love?</p>
<p>Other characters I like are David Mack&#8217;s <strong>Scarab</strong>, <strong>Storm</strong> from the <strong>X-Men</strong> (woefully underused, I think), Alan Moore&#8217;s <strong>Halo Jones</strong> (another character I&#8217;d kill to write) and <strong>Promethea</strong>, Warren Ellis&#8217;s <strong>Jenny Sparks</strong>, and finally, the goddess herself, <strong>Wonder Woman</strong>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve only fallen in love with the Wonder Woman character in the past year, which is completely the result of <strong>Gail Simone</strong>&#8216;s amazing writing. I&#8217;m also now a big fan of Simone&#8217;s <strong>Secret Six</strong> and <strong>Birds of Prey</strong> &#8211; so you can include all the (many) female characters in those series on my list now. Simone is one of the best comic book writers in the industry in my opinion, and she&#8217;s particularly adept at dialogue, especially for the female characters. Her comic books consistently pass the <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2005/10/16/badrepwiki-the-bechdel-test/">Bechdel Test</a>, which so many titles still don&#8217;t do.&#8221;</p>

What have you learned from this so far, and has it ever worked against you?</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;No change occurs if you remain silent. It&#8217;s that simple &#8211; but it&#8217;s not necessarily easy to speak up.</p>
<p>As a woman you know a likely response to raising an issue &#8211; such as the lack of women at an event &#8211; is that you will be dismissed or attacked (especially on the Internet).</p>
<p>So, I always strive to be fair and logical in how I present my case. Sometimes that&#8217;s difficult because I feel so passionately about women getting a fair shake &#8211; well, everyone getting a fair shake, no matter their gender, ethnicity, sexuality, etc.</p>
<p>A number of people have asked me if I think I&#8217;m damaging my career with some of the issues I&#8217;ve raised. So far I&#8217;ve never experienced it, but would it stop me? No.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s be realistic. I&#8217;m speaking out on issues from a pretty safe environment. If I was a female union representative in Mexico &#8211; for example &#8211; I would have a genuine risk in speaking up. Or a mother trying to access education for her girls in Afghanistan. Those people inspire me &#8211; they are taking real risks with their lives and yet find the courage to stand up for what is right.</p>
<p>When I think of that it puts what I do in perspective! (And it makes me donate to aid organisations that help people in those risky situations.)&#8221;</p>
