										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oh, BadRep.  How I wish I didn&#8217;t have to write the article I&#8217;m writing now.  How I wish that everything we fall in love with in the entertainment industry was miles and miles from feministic reproach.  How I wish that something, somewhere would just do everything <em>right</em> and not suck in sudden and unexpected ways.</p>
<p>Today, I&#8217;m subverting my own trope and writing about a game.  I do love a good computer game.  I like ones with excellent, flawed characters, and even more excellent, bizarre plots.  I like them big and sweeping and mind-bending, ideally with some kind of stealth element and something freaky and supernatural in the mix.  So naturally, I love the <strong>Assassin&#8217;s Creed</strong> franchise.  Dear god do I love the <strong>Assassin&#8217;s Creed</strong> franchise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Love&#8221; is probably not the right word.  It&#8217;s not enough to convey the level of brain-melting, nose-bleed-inducing obsession I have with it.  It doesn&#8217;t illustrate the way I dissolve into a twitching heap when exposed to the soundtrack, or that I screamed at the ending of the first game and spent the next week &#8211; avoiding spoilers &#8211; sleeplessly deciphering it with the aid of the internet.  &#8220;Love&#8221; just doesn&#8217;t cover it.  My affection for it is worrying.  It feeds my soul with the purest, shimmering godlike joy from on high through a<em> glee tube</em>.</p>
<p>So please understand how hard it is for me to criticise it in any way.</p>
<p>The franchise is, as the title may suggest, about Assassins with a capital A: not hitmen-for-hire, but the original Hashshashin, a devoted army of politically-motivated killers locked in a battle against the Knights Templar in an exciting tangle of conspiracy theory fodder that gets increasingly bizarre as the series continues.  Most of the characters are male.  This is partially a reflection on the time period in question (mid-Crusades era Syria and the Italian Renaissance) but also because, according to trope, <em>there is only one type of female assassin</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;What type is that?&#8221; I hear you cry, perplexed that there should be more than one type of Assassin at all.</p>
<p>You already know.  It&#8217;s the Sex Assassin.  The one that lures in the victim with sexual desire, and then! when they&#8217;re at their most vulnerable! <em>murders them with stabbing</em>.</p>
<p>This trope is old.  The Sex Assassin is inevitably female.  She&#8217;s the Battle Whore; a sexually desirable object of cunning, guise and stabbing, and it&#8217;s exciting because there she is!  Subverting regular heterosexual intercourse by penetrating the man she&#8217;s seduced!  <em>With a knife.</em> Do you see what they did there!  Surely we are all undone with the inventiveness.  Women being all deadly and effective!  But only if couched in the narrative device of being used as a sex object.  That is the only way they can be empowered, apparently.</p>
<p>I desperately hoped that my beloved <strong>Assassin&#8217;s Creed</strong> would break free of this trope and give us some hard-ass, female battle bastards, but it doesn&#8217;t, really.  I looked at the line-up of playable classes for the most recent massive release, <strong>Assassin&#8217;s Creed: Brotherhood</strong>, and there&#8217;s an array of interesting traditionally male roles: you&#8217;ve got a <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">tank</span> hangman, a plague doctor and a priest&#8230; and then there&#8217;s the woman.  There she is, at the back.  You can tell that she&#8217;s The Woman because there&#8217;s an awful lot of cleavage going on.</p>

<p>She&#8217;s a Sex Assassin.  That&#8217;s what she is.  Because she&#8217;s a woman.  What <em>else</em> would she do?  She&#8217;s <em>special</em>!  She has breasts, unlike all the other people in the world, who are apparently all hard, breastless, cisgendered men.  Women and their breasts are magical and rare, much like unicorns.  So naturally, she&#8217;ll be a Sex Assassin because goodness me, we can&#8217;t have any of the guys doing that.  Because they don&#8217;t have breasts.  <em>And men are not sex objects for anyone ever</em>.  Also, that&#8217;d be gay.  And that&#8217;s <em>terrible</em>!</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a female harlequin, available as an optional extra.  And that&#8217;s brilliant, because the harlequins are terrifying, androgynous, lithe and competent (exactly what you want from an Assassin, really) and it really is nice to see a deadly, dangerous female character that isn&#8217;t a sex worker.   But &#8211; an optional extra?!  Why am I having to look for female characters who aren&#8217;t clinging desperately to the Lady Sex Assassin trope like a koala bear to the last damn eucalyptus tree on earth?</p>
<p>The second game (well, of the big platform releases; there&#8217;s been numerous spin-offs and blah blah blah, massive nerd dump on the series goes here, honestly, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin%27s_Creed_%28series%29">you&#8217;re better served asking Wikipedia</a> than me because <em>it is massively less drooling</em>) is no better.  Ezio, our hero, has to learn how to be stealthy and to pickpocket people.  So, he learns from a female stealth expert.  Guess what she is!  Correct!  A concubine.  Because, of course, there is no other sort of dangerous woman.  All other women in <strong>Assassin&#8217;s Creed II</strong> are either harrowed victims in a revenge cycle, or Ezio&#8217;s passive, faceless lovers.</p>
<p>And what&#8217;s the deal with sex workers being cast as &#8220;dangerous&#8221;, anyway?  Is it yet another embodiment of Evil Female Sexuality, wherein a woman in control of her own sexuality is deemed &#8220;savage&#8221; or &#8220;out of control&#8221;?  Or is it some kind of &#8220;trap&#8221; issue?  The normative dialogue is that Mr. Cisgendered Manly McHeterosexual takes the first step towards initiating sexual contact; our Ms. Sex Assassin twists that by being the one that does the seducing instead.  The assumption, then, is that the seducer is the dangerous one, being as that men are the ones to usually instigate sex, and I&#8217;ve dropped my monocle in horror.</p>
<p>However!  It&#8217;s not all bad news.   Sidestepping any spoilers, <strong>Assassin&#8217;s Creed I </strong>and <strong>II</strong> have &#8220;framing&#8221; characters away from the time-travelling stabbination who are female Assassins.  They don&#8217;t stab anyone up, but are actually totally brilliant, stealthy and clever, <em>and</em> frequently save the (male) protagonist.  There!  That&#8217;s the juice without any spoilers.  The modern-day framing narrative characters rock my entire world, even though they&#8217;re not as action-entrenched as Altaïr or Ezio.</p>
<p>Recently, one of the wonderful Ubisoft community developers I follow on Twitter linked to some beautiful Assassin&#8217;s Creed-related artwork.  &#8220;Sexy Assassin!&#8221; they said.  I exploded with joy all over the internet and clicked through, hoping, as I always do, to find hot male pin-up.</p>
<p>Well.  <a href="http://ubiworkshop.myshopify.com/blogs/news/2329202-two-new-guest-artists-revealed">I found this</a>.</p>
<p>I mean, look at it.  It&#8217;s gorgeously done.  I can&#8217;t paint even <em>remotely</em> that well.  Hats off to the skills there!  It&#8217;s completely brilliant!  And who <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> like stockings?  Nobody.  Stockings are a sure-fire winner.  And, you know, I&#8217;m a fan of knives and stockings.  So that&#8217;s good.</p>
<p>But do you see the point I&#8217;m making?  Women apparently can&#8217;t be Assassins unless they&#8217;re some kind of Sex Assassin.  No!  Please!  It is perfectly possible to have scary, efficient, ruthless, politically-minded, devoted, armoured Assassins who are women.  Please give your female gamers someone to identify with who is tough and awesome <em>without</em> the over-riding message that the only way for them to be so is to give themselves sexually to men.</p>
<p>And, you know, I know this has been said before but &#8211; what&#8217;s with the lack of male pin-ups?  Why can&#8217;t we have male Sex Assassins?  What&#8217;s going on there?  Ezio is certainly meant to be sexy, and there&#8217;s lots of handsome portraiture of both him and the lovely Altaïr from the first game in the fanart-producing sector of the fandom.  But nothing quite like the &#8220;Sexy Assassin&#8221; I&#8217;ve linked to above.  Where&#8217;s all the ludicrous cheese and posturing?  I love cheese and posturing.  Ezio is one of the cheesiest posturers of any videogame character I have ever seen.  So where&#8217;s the pictures of him in just the hood draped all over Florence like it&#8217;s a city-sized <em>chaise longue</em>?</p>
<p>So, Ubisoft, if you&#8217;re reading, I gift to you the following three illustrations:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NUMBER ONE</span>: the battle-worn avenger who kills for her beliefs and her Hashshashin family.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/farm6.static.flickr.com/5007/5266994588_3c36d0252b_o.jpg?resize=361%2C660" alt="" width="361" height="660" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NUMBER TWO</span>: the wise, old Master who is not to be under-estimated despite her years.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/farm2.static.flickr.com/1391/5237410955_ed28a225c8_o.jpg?resize=250%2C662" alt="" width="250" height="662" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NUMBER THREE</span>: Altaïr (artist&#8217;s impression thereof) in stockings doing a cheesecake.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/farm6.static.flickr.com/5046/5267160430_80cc533627_o.jpg?resize=277%2C662" alt="" width="277" height="662" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>NOTE TO READERS:</strong> I really do love <strong>Assassin&#8217;s Creed</strong> more than anything; please don&#8217;t let this article lead you to believe otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>OTHER NOTE TO READERS: </strong>Anyone who suggests that I wrote this article as an excuse to draw Altaïr in lingerie is a heretic and liar and probably a Templar.  <strong>The Brotherhood are watching you.</strong></p>
<p><em>Image credits for the Assassin&#8217;s Creed: Brotherhood box art lie firmly in the hands of Ubisoft.</em></p>

<li><em>Postscript: So then Ubisoft actually read this post, and Markgraf wrote a follow-up. <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/02/08/assassins-creed-postscript-and-haystack-challenge/">You can read that here. </a></em></li>
