					<description><![CDATA[If you remember the Alphabet of Feminism, this one's for you. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Ed&#8217;s note:</strong> In the original Alphabet we did <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/10/18/an-alphabet-of-femininism-3-c-is-for-crinoline/" target="_blank">&#8216;C is for Crinoline&#8217;</a> &#8211; but here&#8217;s something we thought was topically worth coming back to.</p>
<h6 style="text-align: center;">C</h6>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">CHIVALRY</h2>
<blockquote><p>Chivalry is dead, but you&#8217;re still kinda cute.</p>
<p>&#8211; Nelly Furtado, <strong>Promiscuous</strong> (2006)</p></blockquote>
<p>Chivalry. Not one of feminism&#8217;s most pressing issues, but definitely one of its more genteel <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/01/25/keep-the-gift-pay-what-you-owe/" target="_blank">debates</a>.</p>
<p>Do you, as an attractive female who also happens to be a feminist, deign to take the seat that dude offers you on the crowded tube or laugh hollowly and stick your head back in your neighbour&#8217;s armpit? Is chivalry OK?</p>
<p>Personally, my view on this debate is always affected by the point that 99% of the men I&#8217;ve met who talk about chivalry with misty-eyed fervour are also the kind of Nice Guys who Really Aren&#8217;t Very Nice At All.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not for here.</p>
<p>What I am interested in is looking at its complex linguistic heritage.</p>
<h2>Horses</h2>
<p>What&#8217;s that sound in the distance?</p>
<p>Why, it&#8217;s the sound of clopping hooves &#8211; and<em> chivalry</em>&#8216;s etymological root come to join us. Neiiigh.</p>

<p>For though <em>chivalry<strong> </strong></em>in English means (first definition ahoy!)  &#8216;the code of behaviour demonstrated<em> by a perfect knight</em>&#8216;, were we French we&#8217;d replace &#8216;knight&#8217; with &#8216;<em>chevalier</em>&#8216;, or &#8216;horseman&#8217; &#8211; from the root word <em>cheval</em> (= &#8216;horse&#8217;).</p>
<p>The knight, or <em>chevalier</em>, is <em> </em>in origin a nobleman on horseback who goes around rescuing maidens and fighting dragons. He is <em>chivalrous </em>in behaviour, displaying (the word&#8217;s second definition) &#8216;courage, honour, justice and readiness to help the weak&#8217;.</p>
<p>Key examples can be found in the legends of King Arthur and his horsebacked Knights of the Round Table &#8211; in particular Sir Gawain and the so-good-he-couldn&#8217;t-be-gooder Sir Percival (who later becomes Wagner&#8217;s <strong>Parsifal</strong>).</p>
<p>The chivalrous are those on horseback.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s the secondary meaning of <em>chivalry</em> that we best recognise today: &#8216;<em>courteous</em> behaviour, especially towards women&#8217; (that is, giving up your seat on the tube, which Percival would totally have done if he didn&#8217;t travel everywhere by <em>cheval</em>).<em> </em></p>
<h2>Courtly-powered lovin&#8217;</h2>
<p>Chivalry &#8211; and the <em>courtesy </em>that defines it &#8211; is also the base idea behind <em>courtly</em> <em>love</em>, which the devoted may remember we addressed separately in the <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/12/20/an-alphabet-of-femininism-12-l-is-for-lady/" target="_blank">Alphabet Glory Days</a>.</p>

<p>This is what the knights are doing when they&#8217;re not out fighting &#8211;  sighing for love among rose bushes, swooning at the touch of a <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/11/01/an-alphabet-of-femininism-5-e-is-for-emancipate/" target="_blank">&#8216;lily-white hand&#8217;</a> and <em>definitely </em>giving up their seats for a woman on the medieval commute.</p>
<p>And it was said to have been invented by a woman, Eleanor of Aquitaine.</p>
<p>Before she married Henry II and brought her French customs over to England, Eleanor had a period presiding alone over a predominantly male grouping in Poitiers.It seems inventing an elaborate code of chaste devotion to a single lady &#8211; <em>court</em>eous behaviour, if you will &#8211; was a good way for Eleanor to bring these bored and potentially restless knights into order &#8211; and, I assume, to block potential sexual aggression at the same time (cf. the court of Elizabeth I, which saw a resurgence of &#8216;courtly&#8217; devotion to &#8216;Gloriana&#8217;, the &#8216;Virgin <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/02/07/an-alphabet-of-femininism-17-q-is-for-queen/" target="_blank">Queen</a>&#8216;).</p>
<h2>Courtship</h2>
<p>With these courtly roots, it&#8217;s appropriate that, during the English Civil War, the word <em>chevalier </em>should lend itself so enthusiastically to the Royalist cause in fighting for king (and court).</p>
<p>In this context, the Cavaliers were enemies to the Roundheads and cousins to <em>chevaliers</em> via the Latin source-word &#8216;cabellarius&#8217; (also meaning &#8216;horseman&#8217;).</p>
<p>The origin of this term is actually pre-war, in the grouping of courtly &#8216;cavaliers&#8217; at the original Carolingian court (a bit like the courtly lovers at Poitiers).</p>
<p>These included the &#8216;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavalier_poet" target="_blank">Cavalier poets</a>&#8216;, a conglomerate of literary courtiers formed by the King himself, including Robert Herrick and Edmund Waller.</p>
<p>The term in this usage is ambiguous, though. On the one hand, <em>cavalier</em> was often used in allusion to the King&#8217;s refined (indeed &#8216;knightly&#8217;) sensibilities, which, incidentally, included a famous love of horses &#8211; as the many magnificent equestrian portraits of him attest.</p>
<p>But, in a pejorative sense, the <em>cavalier poets </em>were so named because they were famously &#8216;roistering gallants&#8217; and &#8216;libertines&#8217;. This is <em>cavalier</em>&#8216;s other meaning: &#8216;haughty, disdainful or supercilious&#8217; or &#8216;offhand and unceremonious&#8217; (a bit like wearing your hat at a<a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/02/14/an-alphabet-of-femininism-18-r-is-for-rake/" target="_blank"> &#8216;rakish&#8217; angle</a>).</p>
<p>So <em>cavalier </em>is almost a contraction in terms.</p>
<h2>The Don</h2>
<p>This is the very ambiguity we find in Mozart&#8217;s great libertine opera, <strong>Don Giovanni</strong>, written about 100 years later. The &#8216;Don&#8217; is a nobleman and serial womaniser. He&#8217;s a standard-issue<a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/02/14/an-alphabet-of-femininism-18-r-is-for-rake/" target="_blank"> rake</a>, in fact: we learn in the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fccdGBi9JUs&amp;t=2m30s" target="_blank">Catalogue Song</a> that he&#8217;s seduced 1,003 women in Spain alone.</p>

<p>He is throughout referred to in the Italian as a &#8216;cavalier&#8217;, understood (and, for us English-speakers, translated) according to context variously as &#8216;gentleman&#8217; (nobleman on horseback) and &#8216;rake&#8217; (careless womaniser) &#8211; as in the opera&#8217;s subtitle, &#8216;Il <em>dissoluto</em> punito&#8217; (&#8216;the debauchee punished&#8217;).</p>
<p>Thus, when Don Giovanni takes the pretty peasant girl Zerlina away from her finance, Masetto, to show her his castle (no, really), Don Giovanni &#8216;reassures&#8217; the jealous Masetto by saying he needn&#8217;t worry &#8211; his fiancee is &#8216;in the hands of a <em>cavalier</em>&#8216;.Unfortunately, that&#8217;s exactly what Masetto is afraid of. &#8220;Let the<em> cavaliere </em>make a <em>cavaliera</em> out of you!&#8221; he trumpets at the departing Zerlina &#8211; he knows what&#8217;s going down (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q40a23gfxZE" target="_blank">this</a>).</p>
<h2>Court to City</h2>
<p>Back to English climes.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the eighteenth century, Queen Anne halved the size of the English court and moved it out of central London.</p>
<p>In so doing, she ultimately ended up transferring power from court to city &#8211; and <em>courtesy </em>became <em></em>civility (from the Latin <em>cives</em> (= the city)).</p>

<p>This is the age of opening doors, watching your language and standing up when a woman enters the room. Chivalry has gone domestic; men are <em>civil </em>now in Britain. Only the hot-headed Italian Don Giovannis are still <em>cavaliers</em>.</p>
<p>But when Samuel Richardson wanted to depict a perfect (but domestic) Englishman, he still made him an aristocratic knight (<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sir</span> Charles Grandison</strong>). Jane Austen did too: her paragon of virtue (himself based on Sir Charles), is pointedly named Mr <em>Knightly</em> (<strong>Emma</strong>).By this point it&#8217;s faded away to a name rather than a title, but the gentleman still has a vestigial horse (if you will).</p>
<h2>White Knights</h2>
<p>Strangely enough, the vestigial horse becomes more literal in the modern age, in the form of the ladies&#8217; proverbial &#8216;ideal man&#8217; &#8211; a chivalrous gentleman. Mr Right is also a &#8216;knight in shining armour&#8217;.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s even a  Lewis Carroll-esque &#8216;White Knight&#8217;, a noble rescuer (as in the song &#8216;My White Knight&#8217; from Meredith Wilson&#8217;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_oyzwsJOhU" target="_blank"><strong>The Music Man</strong></a>, where the knight in question will, her mother thinks, &#8216;save&#8217; Marian the Librarian from Old Maidery).</p>
<p>Remember when Grace first meets Leo &#8211; the Great Romance &#8211; in <strong>Will and Grace</strong>? He&#8217;s on a horse in Central Park. That&#8217;s how you know he&#8217;s a Big Deal Romance.</p>
<h2>Never trust a man on horseback</h2>
<p>And, to conclude very crudely, I suppose this is what happened to <em>chivalry </em>.</p>
<p>It became the polite behaviour of the  gentleman &#8211; enshrined in tradition and developed over a couple of hundred years to become our friend offering me a seat on the bustling 21st century commute<strong> </strong>and sitcom single girls dreaming of their &#8216;Mr Darcy&#8217;.</p>
<p>But I still hear the sound of clopping hooves. The fantasy may be more Sir Gawain than Don Giovanni, but you know what they say &#8211; the apple never falls far from the lexical tree.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[*Dramatic pause* Feminism killed chivalry! Gasp. But you knew that already.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chivalry is dead, I&#8217;m told. And now you are all conveniently gathered here in the lobby of this stylish hotel / bar of this cruise ship / dining car of this luxury train I am ready to unmask the culprit. Yes, she&#8217;s here in the room with us. *Dramatic pause* Feminism killed chivalry!</p>
<p>Gasp.</p>
<p>But you knew that already. It&#8217;s the least mysterious murder mystery ever. Even <a title="Wikipedia - Hastings" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Hastings" target="_blank">Hastings</a> could have cracked it (well, maybe). Just google &#8220;chivalry is dead!&#8221; and you&#8217;ll find plenty of witnesses to testify to the fact that it was feminism what done it.</p>
<p>It is also, apparently, a tragic case of mistaken identity as countless Daily Fail and Torygraph writers assert that chivalry wasn&#8217;t even sexist. It&#8217;s just about being nice to women. Isn&#8217;t that what you want, slavering harpy hordes? For us to be nice to you?</p>

I spend quite a lot of time arguing about gender on the internet, as you might imagine. And recently the most inflammatory topic seems to be chivalry. Sparked by a call from Graham Linehan on Twitter for chivalry to be resurrected (see <a title="Glinner twitter status" href="https://twitter.com/#!/Glinner/status/132627658944151552" target="_blank">here</a> and <a title="Glinner status 2" href="https://twitter.com/#!/Glinner/status/132630145675694080" target="_blank">here</a>) I&#8217;ve gotten into a number or heated discussions disputing the value of chivalry today. Sadly, I believe rumours of the death of chivalry to have been greatly exaggerated.</p>
<p>Some people I spoke to claimed that they were defending chivalry as a general approach, towards all genders. But isn&#8217;t that just &#8216;not being an arse&#8217;? Why does it need a special name? Especially one with such deeply gendered associations. However pure the intention, bringing chivalry back from the dead serves no one. It&#8217;s a problematic idea in any context because it fetishises an imbalance of power. It&#8217;s fairness as charity rather than right, in which a privileged group extend a superficial form of power to another group along highly formalised lines.</p>
<p>As it is most commonly understood, as a code of behaviour for men towards women, chivalry is sexist. As <a title="Traditional romance is creepy" href="http://pandagon.net/index.php/site/comments/traditional_romance_is_creepy" target="_blank">Amanda Marcotte</a> says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Chivalry is a set of behaviors where men feign servitude and humility towards women, but in practice they tend to actually reinforce men&#8217;s greater social status.</p></blockquote>
<p>In my recent conversations I&#8217;ve been confirmed in my suspicion that there are a lot of Nice Guys out there who don&#8217;t want to hear this. I think the most common objections I&#8217;ve encountered go like this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;But I believe in equality/I&#8217;m a feminist, how dare you tell me I&#8217;m sexist just for being nice to women? That doesn&#8217;t fit with my carefully constructed self-image *cries*&#8221;</p>
<p>Following codes of behaviour towards women forged hundreds of years ago isn&#8217;t really an act of gender resistance. Sorry. Try turning your deeply-held commitment to equality to use by being considerate and respectful to everybody. If you already are: great! Why not drop the silly name for it?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;But I&#8217;m only being nice. Would you rather I punched you in the face rather than opening the door for you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Are you nice in this way to everyone? If so, good for you! If not: lots of women find chivalric or &#8216;gentlemanly&#8217; behaviour patronising or irritating at best, and creepy and coercive at worst.  Of course I prefer chivalry to brazen misogyny, but those aren&#8217;t the only choices, people. And both enshrine an archaic, damaging attitude toward women and reinforce the idea that women should be treated as women rather than as people.</p>
<p>You may have seen the pithy, ironic poems by suffragist Alice Duer Miller that Lili Loofbourow shared on the <a title="Hairpin - Are Women People?" href="http://thehairpin.com/2012/01/are-women-people" target="_blank">Hairpin</a> the other day. Her meditation on chivalry is one of my favourites, and neatly captures the problems with the idea:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s treating a woman politely<br />
As long as she isn&#8217;t a fright:<br />
It&#8217;s guarding the girls who act rightly,<br />
If you can be judge of what&#8217;s right;<br />
It&#8217;s being—not just, but so pleasant;<br />
It&#8217;s tipping while wages are low;<br />
It&#8217;s making a beautiful present,<br />
And failing to pay what you owe.</p></blockquote>
<p>Exactly. Women are owed equality. In the context of hundreds of years of struggle to be taken seriously, for agency, autonomy, self-representation, and social, political and economic power, the feeble gift of a seat or a door held open can feel like a joke. Or even an insult. For me it acts as a reminder of the social expectation &#8211; even now &#8211; <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/12/20/an-alphabet-of-femininism-12-l-is-for-lady/">to be ladylike</a>. Grateful, graceful, delicate. Powerless.</p>
<h3>Epilogue</h3>
<p>Besides, chivalry can quickly become desperately tedious, as <a title="Hark! A Vagrant" href="http://harkavagrant.com/" target="_blank">Kate Beaton</a> understands:</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Funny Etymology Submission #billion: lady sprung from the Old English hlaefdige (I dunno, I didn't do Old English), a compound of hlaf ('loaf') and dig ('to knead'). So a lady is literally 'she who kneads loaves'.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<h6 style="text-align: center;">L</h6>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">LADY</h2>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: normal;">&#8216;My lady&#8217;, as her friends called her, sincerely desired to be a genuine lady, and was so at heart, but had yet to learn that money cannot buy refinement of nature, that rank does not always confer nobility, and that true breeding makes itself felt in spite of external drawbacks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">Louisa May Alcott, </span><strong>Good Wives </strong>(1869)</p></blockquote>
<h3>She&#8217;s A Lady.</h3>
<p>Funny Etymology Submission #billion: <em>lady </em>sprung from the Old English <em>hlaefdige </em>(I dunno, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKLNp890Qlc">I didn&#8217;t do Old English</a>), a compound of <em>hlaf</em> (&#8216;loaf&#8217;) and <em>dig</em> (&#8216;to knead&#8217;). So a <em>lady </em>is literally &#8216;she who kneads loaves&#8217;.</p>
<p>I guess you can kind of see where it went from there, since its original (now obsolete) meaning is as &#8216;the female head of the household&#8217;; i.e., the one what does the cooking, with the ambiguity that still runs through many households where Mum&#8217;s In Charge, but Dad&#8217;s Earning. Thus, in its second meaning (also Old English), it becomes &#8216;A woman who rules over subjects<em>&#8216;, </em>now only used in &#8216;poetical&#8217; or &#8216;rhetorical&#8217; senses. But in extended Middle English usage, it&#8217;s refined to &#8216;A woman who is the object of a man&#8217;s devotion; a mistress, lady-love&#8217;.</p>
<h3>That&#8217;s No Lady, That&#8217;s My Wife.</h3>
<p>Here we enter the troubled seas of <em><a href="http://www.harkavagrant.com/index.php?id=282">courtly love</a></em>, that pretty part of medieval culture peopled by sighing knights sitting under rose-bushes. Supposedly &#8216;invented&#8217; by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_of_Aquitaine">Eleanor of Aquitaine</a>, at her court in Poitiers, it was brought to England with her marriage to Henry II in 1152.</p>

<p>The basic idea was an almost iconoclastic worship of your <em>lady-love</em>,<em> </em>whose favours you sought through brave deeds, refined behaviour and that sort of thing. The highest &#8216;favour&#8217; was the fantastically ambiguous &#8216;naked embrace&#8217; (although you might well sleep with an unsheathed sword between you), and your &#8216;lady-love&#8217;<em> </em>didn&#8217;t have to be a viable option – she could be married, generically unavailable, or just someone you&#8217;d never met but heard lots about down the alehouse. She was a spur to bravery, swordplay and courtliness, not, like, your <em>girlfriend</em>.</p>
<h3>Lay Lady Lay.</h3>
<p>But courtly love was emphatically not a concept that elevated<em> hoi polloi</em>: your lady would be a <em>lady</em> in the fourth sense of the word (&#8216;a woman of superior social position&#8217;) and quite possibly also in the specific extended sense of the second, &#8216;the female corresponding to lord&#8217; (Lord and Lady Godiva).</p>
<p>In contrast, <em>peasants</em> &#8216;are impelled to acts of love in the natural way like a <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/12/06/an-alphabet-of-femininism-10-j-is-for-jade/">horse</a> or a mule&#8217;, in the words of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Capellanus">Andreas Capellanus</a>, who quite literally wrote the rule book for courtly love. Capellanus advises his readers to steer clear of the &#8216;game&#8217; of love where the lower classes are involved, and, if overcome with lust, to &#8216;find a suitable spot [and] not delay in taking what you seek, gaining it by rough embraces&#8217;<sup><a href="/2010/12/20/an-alphabet-of-femininism-12-l-is-for-lady/#footnote_0_1557" id="identifier_0_1557" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" &hellip;all translations are P.G. Walsh&rsquo;s: it&rsquo;s too early in the morning to read blogposts in Medieval Latin. ">1</a></sup> .</p>
<p>And such attitudes are never far from this most &#8216;pretty&#8217; of love-traditions – a lyric in the <em>Carmina Burana </em>(c.1230) tells what happens when, despite &#8216;long service&#8217;, the <em>lady </em>still denies her knight &#8216;the final and best stage&#8217;:</p>
<blockquote><p>She rampages with her sharp nails, tears my hair, forcefully repels my violence. She coils herself and entwines her knees to prevent the door of her maidenhead from being unbarred. But at last my campaign makes progress; [&#8230;] I tighten by embraces our entwined bodies, I pin her arms, I implant hard kisses. In this way Venus&#8217; palace is unbarred.</p></blockquote>
<p>The ambiguous power-structure at the heart of being someone&#8217;s <em>lady </em>could hardly be clearer.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 13px;">All this said, if you were Specially Virtuous, courtly love was the ideal forum for worshipping a very specific <em>lady</em> – the word&#8217;s third sense, &#8216;Our Lady&#8217;, the Virgin Mary. </span><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 13px;">Ah, Mary. Everybody loves Mary, and throughout the middle ages, she picked up honorific titles like a big bit of blue velcro: &#8216;Our Lady&#8217;, &#8216;Our Blessed Lady&#8217;, &#8216;Our Lady of Sorrows&#8217;, &#8216;the Queen of Heaven&#8217;, &#8216;the Blessed Virgin&#8217; you name it. She even had a special colour-code – white (sometimes red) and blue. Pre-<em>Prussian Blue</em> (discovered in 1704), blues were the most expensive painting pigments, so someone decided MARY SHALL WEAR ONLY BLUE, WE LOVE HER SO.</span></p>
<p>Nevertheless, Mary has an evil analogue: post-Reformation, there are plenty of references to the &#8216;Lady of Rome&#8217; or the &#8216;Lady of Babylon&#8217;, an abusive term for the Catholic church in reference to the &#8216;scarlet woman&#8217; of the Apocalypse. The dichotomy continues outside religion: see also <em>lady</em>&#8216;s more worldly senses: <em>lady of easy virtue, lady of the town</em>, etc.</p>
<h3>The Lady Is A Tramp.</h3>
<p>In modern usage, <em>lady</em>&#8216;s social standing is &#8216;loosely defined but not very high&#8217;; often, it is &#8216;merely a courteous synonym for <em>woman</em>&#8216;, giving a strange social gloss to cisgendered biological fact. It was around 1861 (just before <strong>Good Wives</strong>) that it got its more specific sense as &#8216;a woman whose manners, habits and sentiments are those characteristic of the higher ranks of society&#8217;.</p>
<p>This could be interpreted as Alcott uses it, or, if you are Walt Disney, as exactly what it says: think <strong>Lady and the Tramp</strong><em> </em>(1955), one of many poor boy &#8211; rich girl tales. The title plays on Sinatra&#8217;s song &#8216;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VJY97l0jVA">T<strong>he Lady Is A Tramp</strong></a>&#8216;, which is repeated in strangely sexualised <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BN69gnkNtLo">form in the film </a>about the Tramp himself (you could never have a female <em>tramp</em>). The same idea returns in feline form in <strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-iUVGcym3o">The Aristocats</a></strong><em> </em>(1970), where again Society wins but appropriates some of the gritty male spark from the other side of the tracks. For polite desecration only, please.</p>
<p>So a <em>lady </em>can stand for certain upper-class &#8216;manners, habits and sentiments&#8217; that are in opposition to those of a simple <em>man or</em> <em>woman. </em>From courtly love to the leash and collar set, the feminized force of sophistication calms, restrains, and decorates.</p>
