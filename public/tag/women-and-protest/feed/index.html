					<description><![CDATA[From the past few months of coverage and debate, here are just a few things which have interested me on the complexities of Pussy Riot’s background and media presentation.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since we first wrote on Pussy Riot <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/02/06/revolting-women-slight-return-russias-pussy-riot/">back in February</a>, widespread attention has been given to the subsequent arrest, trial and imprisonment of three members of the group, while <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/15/us-russia-protest-idUSBRE88E06R20120915">mass anti-government protest continues in Russia</a>. From the past few months of coverage and debate, here are just a few things which have interested me on the complexities of Pussy Riot’s background and media presentation.</p>
<p>This (mildly NSFW) video is кисья ересь (Heresy of Little Cats), by the Russian electro-punk band Barto:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/oyMMqUzRa1A?rel=0" frameborder="0" width="420" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>As a non-speaker of Russian who hasn’t found the lyrics anywhere, I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a lot I’m not getting, but I like the song, the band are <a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/arts_n_ideas/article/electro-punk-barto-is-a-band-with-an-ideology/425794.html">pretty admirable</a>, and I like the video’s satirical emphasis on the patriarchal intertwining of political and religious authorities – the formal alliance of Putin’s government and the Russian Orthodox Church, making it possible for civil disobedience to be framed as blasphemy, was a point of contention highlighted by the Pussy Riot trial.</p>
<p>I found the song via <a href="http://myplacefp7.wordpress.com/2012/08/17/get-on-the-way-pussy-riot/">this post</a>, which discusses the relatively muted response by the Russian underground music scene to the group’s trial and imprisonment. It also corrects the impression of Pussy Riot as (merely?) a feminist punk band, when they are more a product of the intersection between political activism and performance art:</p>
<blockquote><p>As a matter of fact Pussy Riot, although calling themselves a punk-band and using the sign of punk in their performances, never belonged to the Russian punk scene. They consider themselves as art-actionists, clearly place themselves in the context of contemporary Russian actionism, quoting the names of Prigov, Brener, Kulik and other art-provocateurs of the 1990s.</p></blockquote>
<p>So Pussy Riot’s frequently mentioned connection with riot grrrl has more to do with the latter’s existence as a DIY subculture involving zines, art, détournement and activism, than with music alone. Which is fair enough; back in the 90s, one of the odder of Courtney Love’s swipes at Kathleen Hanna, in fact, was that “She&#8217;s not really in a band&#8230; She&#8217;s a political activist who took a bunch of women&#8217;s studies classes.&#8221; On the subject of Pussy Riot, Hanna herself had <a title="Kathleen Hanna" href="http://www.kathleenhanna.com/seriously-they-are-in-a-fucking-cage/" target="_blank">this</a> to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>What if people all over the world started their own performance groups, bands, art collectives, etc… and called them things like Pussy Riot Olympia. Pussy Riot, Athens Greece, Pussy Riot Paris, etc….And maybe if this trial turns out as the prosecutors want it to, with the women getting at least 3 years, we all play benefits and go to Russia en masse under the banner that we are all Pussy Riot, Yoko Ono could be in Pussy Riot, Patti Smith could be wearing a mask next to a troupe of girls from Tennesee storming the Cathedral of Christ the Savior screaming “We are all Pussy Riot!!!”</p></blockquote>
<p>As I wrote in February, it makes sense to consider Pussy Riot in the context of the former Soviet Union’s <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/adamcurtis/2012/01/the_years_of_stagnation_and_th.html">long and fascinating history</a> of political protest coalescing around<em> avant garde</em> art and music, especially punk. The Western media, perhaps understandably, tended instead to present the band in more straightforward and simplistic terms – rendering them more comprehensible to a Western audience, sure, but often in a less than helpful manner. I’d been hoping someone would pick up on the patronising and infantilising aspects of much of the media presentation of Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, Maria Alyokhina and Yekaterina Samutsevich, and, in <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/08/manic-pixie-dream-dissidents-how-the-world-misunderstands-pussy-riot/261309/">this article</a>, Sarah Kendzior nails it:</p>
<blockquote><p>Imagine this: The three men sit in court, awaiting their verdict. The youngest, a experienced dissident described by the media as a “sultry sex symbol” with “Angelina Jolie lips”, glances at his colleague, an activist praised by the Associated Press for his “pre-Raphaelite looks”. Between them sits a third man, whose lack of glamour has led the New Republic to label him “the brain” and deem his hair a “poof of dirty blonde frizz”. The dissidents – or “boys” as they are called in headlines around the world – have been the subject of numerous fashion and style profiles ever since they first spoke out against the Russian government. “He’s a flash of moving color,” the New York Times writes approvingly about their protests, “never an individual boy.” If this sounds ridiculous, it should – and not only because I changed the gender… Pussy Riot identifies as feminist, but you would never know it from the Western media, who celebrate the group with the same language that the Russian regime uses to marginalize them. The three members of Pussy Riot are “girls”, despite the fact that all of them are in their twenties and two of them are mothers. They are “punkettes”, diminutive variations on a 1990s indie-rock prototype that has little resemblance to Pussy Riot’s own trajectory as independent artists and activists.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, as Kendzior also points out, Pussy Riot have far more pressing concerns than being mischaracterized in the press. But:</p>
<blockquote><p>Pussy Riot also tells us a lot about how we see non-Western political dissent in the new media age, and could suggest a habit of mischaracterizing their grave mission in terms that feel more familiar but ultimately sell the dissidents short: youthful rebellion, rock and roll, damsels in distress.</p></blockquote>
<p>A lot of this sentiment is familiar: an impulse to treat protest in which women, particularly young women, are prominent, as fun, flippant, and fundamentally unserious. It’s the reverse of the censorious and sensationalist ‘Rage of the Girl Rioters’ response to the 2010 UK student protests. In the case of Pussy Riot, arguments for their sympathetic treatment are often explicitly predicated on the power imbalance involved – they are ‘just’ ordinary women (or indeed ‘girls’), what threat to the state can they possibly pose? – which surely entrenches the idea of women as both relatively powerless and harmless, rather than enabling any sort of feminist empowerment. Away from such frustrating portayals, however, there’s something to be said for the earlier stages of Pussy Riot’s trajectory, which offer examples both of how music can form part of a wider oppositional movement and for how women’s protest can be collective and anonymous, with no need of iconic or martyred figureheads.</p>
<p>And yes, I do realise this post can be summarised as: &#8220;Pussy Riot? Preferred their earlier work, before they got so commercial&#8221;. So it goes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday we posted Part 1 of our interview with anti-cuts activist Roxanne, who told us some pretty unsettling stuff about her experience of being arrested &#8211; <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/10/04/take-it-to-the-bridge-beyond-the-rage-of-the-girl-rioters-part-12">read it here</a>. </p>
<p>On with Part 2, then. </p>
<p><strong>Let&#8217;s talk about UK Uncut as a movement. Do you reckon it&#8217;s pretty equally gender split, and if so, do you reckon acting as a collective helps achieve this more effectively?</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn’t feel confident commenting on the gender split in UK Uncut &#8211; I&#8217;d be referring to tens of thousands of people across the UK. However, in terms of active groups working within the UK, the majority are dominated by white males. But this is why we need to be talking about cuts in terms of gender: to encourage women to join the frontline.</p>

However, it is still true that certain vulnerable groups within society are to be hit in ways that the more privileged may not be. Disabled people are losing their Disability Living Allowance, poorer students have lost the EMA that they and their families rely on, and some women will no longer be able to work because they now have to care for elderly family members or young children. I strongly believe that highlighting the different ways in which the cuts fall should spur people into action, on behalf of themselves or those less able, instead of acting in some divisive way. So what if today we’re standing up against cuts to childcare and you don’t have or want children &#8211; don’t you want to protect those in society who do? </p>
<p>&#8220;These aren’t just issues for women, because protecting women and vulnerable groups is in the interest of the whole of society.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Have you found any women&#8217;s protest movements around the world or in history particularly inspiring?</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;There are so many instances of women’s protest that inspire me consistently. At the moment I’ve been reading about the experiences of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assata_Shakur">Assata Shakur</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Davis">Angela Davis</a>, and find myself inspired by their unrelenting power (and their incredible writing!). </p>
<p>&#8220;I am inspired by the endurance of the women at <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/09/08/revolting-women-greenham-common/">Greenham Common</a>, and the physical strength of the four women who <a href="http://www.cultureshop.org/details.php?code=SEEDS">destroyed a Hawk fighter jet with hammers</a> that was being sold by the British government to East Timor to be used in the government’s illegal occupation of the country. I also recall an image of a row of Zapatista women standing in line with their faces covered but still wearing these incredible bright dresses &#8211; and that image alone inspires me. But closer to home, I am inspired by the women close to me and the support we provide for each other.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>What would your advice be to young women reading our blog who are concerned about the impact of the cuts? Maybe they&#8217;ve never been on a protest before. Perhaps they&#8217;re even a little nervous to start &#8211; do &#8220;clicktivism&#8221; and hashtags and so on make a difference in themselves?</strong></p>

Photo by Flickr user dee_gee, shared under Creative Commons licence." title="no cuts" width="237" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7670" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/no-cuts.jpg?w=237&amp;ssl=1 237w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/no-cuts.jpg?w=396&amp;ssl=1 396w" sizes="(max-width: 237px) 100vw, 237px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>&#8220;Well, I wouldn’t say hashtags aren’t worth anything &#8211; that’s how UK Uncut started! But my advice to anyone nervous to get involved would be that anything that is worth fighting for is going to be a little scary, so that’s even more reason to give it a go. It’s scary because there is so much at stake. The kind of action UK Uncut takes is a great way to get involved. It’s fun and creative and there is always space for people to choose their own style of action, and meet other people who share the same views.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although other types of protest can be effective, I believe that direct action is necessary in any situation where other avenues have been exhausted and shut down. And that is the situation we are in now. For example, the reforms the NHS is facing weren’t in the Conservative or the Lib Dem manifesto, and this coalition government is not even acting on behalf of the majority vote. So how is it fair that these radical changes are being made to a health service that Britain should be so proud of achieving, but is instead determined to destroy, without a say from the public who use it? </p>
<p>&#8220;The leaders in charge of pushing through the bill do not have the population’s interests at heart, are not interested in what we want or what we have to say. But this is our NHS &#8211; we rely on it, and we must protect it.&#8221; </p>
<p><strong>Is it hard for protesters to keep momentum going in the face of these cuts? What&#8217;s next for you? </strong></p>
<p>&#8220;The groups organising actions every week across the country keep momentum going. This issue isn’t going away, the cuts are already being felt, and the fight against them will continue.</p>
<p>&#8220;UK Uncut have just announced the next day of mass action, called <a href="http://www.ukuncut.org.uk/blog/block-the-bridge-block-the-bill"><strong>‘Block the Bridge, Block the Bill’</strong></a> &#8211; 2000 people are already attending on the Facebook event, and hopefully will be showing how serious they are about not losing their National Health Service by transforming Westminster Bridge into hospitals, medical lectures, and a space to share stories about the NHS. </p>
<p>&#8220;On October 12th, the Lords have one last chance to amend the Health and Social Care Bill in Parliament before it is voted on again, and we have one last chance to show that we won’t lose our health service. So join UK Uncut on October 9th and take part in the fight against the cuts!&#8221;</p>

<p>In the era of headlines like <em>RAGE OF THE GIRL RIOTERS</em>, what&#8217;s it like for women on the front line of anti-cuts protesting in the UK right now? Roxanne was at that first sit-in at the London Vodafone flagship store on 27 October 2010 &#8211; out of which <a href="http://www.ukuncut.org.uk/about/ukuncut">a nucleus of energy exploded</a> into the movement we now call <strong>UK Uncut</strong>. </p>

What do you think is the struggle for women in terms of the impact of these cuts? Obviously &#8220;women&#8221; aren&#8217;t a monolithic or homogenous group, but is there a distinct fight?</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;The full scale of the public sector cuts <a href="http://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/index.asp?PageID=1195">fall in a way that is unbalanced in terms of gender</a>. Women make up most of the public sector jobs being cut, women rely most heavily on public services and on certain benefits that are being cut, and where vulnerable people like children, the disabled and the elderly are stripped of their governmental support, it has historically been women that step in to bridge the gap and become carers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The cuts attack services that women depend on in order to live ‘equally’ with men, services that are there to compensate for existing gender inequalities &#8211; Rape Crisis centres and helplines, SureStart and childcare benefits. These are not privileges. Many women rely on these services. Without them, the progress that past generations have made by fighting to get us this far is being unnecessarily sacrificed. The cuts will push us back in time in terms of women’s rights and equality.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don’t believe the struggle is distinct &#8211; this is a fight that everyone should be fighting &#8211; but we should be aware of what we are fighting for and what we, as women, truly stand to lose. The message out there is not clear enough yet – as these cuts fall, they will cut through the progress women have made. </p>
<p>&#8220;The problem is, because of existing sexism within our society and a scepticism towards ‘feminism’, it is still so hard to have conversations about women and the inequality we struggle with. I believe we need more and more great acts of exciting and inviting civil disobedience to get people thinking seriously about gender and the cuts.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Have you found that the police and the media have treated you differently as a female protestor?</strong></p>

Of course. In the most extreme sense, my personal experience of being arrested was interesting in terms of my treatment as a woman. The fact that I am young and female was repeatedly used against me, as a way to make me feel inferior. Of course, that&#8217;s often what the police aim to do with any arrestee; to intimidate and isolate. But after talking to male activists, it seems to me that the treatment is often different if you are a woman in custody. </p>
<p>&#8220;I was arrested by a woman. She commented frequently on my appearance, asking things like, “Do you never brush your hair?” and when I was asked if this was my natural hair colour, she pulled at my roots and answered on my behalf, “No.” A friend of mine was arrested at the same time, and the woman arresting her was even worse. She searched through her backpack, pulled out a pair of underwear and pulled a face like she was disgusted to be holding them. She stretched them out and waved them in the faces of the male officers around, who seemed genuinely embarrassed and uncomfortable at the treatment this woman was giving my friend.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn’t any better when I was in the cell. I was not allowed to use my own tampon, and when I asked for a new one I was told the police station didn’t keep any. I was then given one hours later, which I had to use until I was released after 24 hours. Why don’t police stations have to stock tampons? They have to go out any buy you food if you have special requirements. I was also told I had to be watched closely as I inserted the tampon, which I later found out did not happen to other female activists in different stations. Taking away human rights as basic as this seems like just one more way to reduce an arrestee to a more helpless and regretful position.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>So how did this all get started for you, and is anti-cuts action your first foray into public protest?</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I was involved in environmental activism before UK Uncut, and that is where I learned about the use of direct action as a political tactic. I also learned how to use the consensus model of decision making which empowers each individual to have their say and play an equal part in the movement. These skills have been invaluable to me in every action I have been involved in. </p>
<p>&#8220;I felt that I had to do something to try and stop the government cutting the services that I am most proud of, that society’s most vulnerable people rely on to live in this country. I used to be proud of the structures we had built here to support our population- we built the NHS when we had a bigger deficit than we have today. We should all be proud of such universal services, and we shouldn’t give up the fight and watch as they are all sold off to profit-making companies.&#8221;</p>

Thank you to Sophie of <a href="http://clamorousvoice.wordpress.com/"><strong>Clamorous Voice</strong></a> for this guestpost!</em></p>
<p><strong>Geneviève Pastre</strong> is France&#8217;s leading lesbian activist, poet, writer and philosopher. Born in 1924, she is responsible in a large measure for the creation of the Gay Liberation Movement in France.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/franceprotest.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="7470" data-permalink="/2011/09/21/revolting-women-genevieve-pastre/franceprotest/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/franceprotest.jpg?fit=2538%2C1697&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="2538,1697" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="franceprotest" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/franceprotest.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/franceprotest.jpg?fit=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-7470 aligncenter" title="franceprotest" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/franceprotest-1024x684.jpg?resize=553%2C369" alt="black and white photo showing crowd of young protesters carrying a large white banner which proclaims  gay rights in French.

Je suis poéte et danseuse&#8221; (I am not an activist. I am a poet and a dancer). Nevertheless, she has also been a journalist, radio broadcaster, publisher, mime artist and theatre director.</p>
<p>Pastre&#8217;s coming-out, at the age of 56, followed successful careers as an academic, theatre practitioner and poet. Born in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainz#20th_century">French-occupied Mainz</a> after the First World War, Pastre was educated at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorbonne">Sorbonne</a>, then became a high school teacher. While in Paris, Pastre studied mime with <a href="http://www.marcelmarceau.com/bio.html">Marcel Marceau</a> and <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-jacques-lecoq-1076692.html">Jacques Lecoq</a>; between 1960 and 1976, Pastre also directed a theatre troupe, which would eventually take her name: Compagnie Geneviève Pastre.</p>
<p>It was during her time as a director that Pastre began gaining recognition as a poet, subsequently publishing ten poetry collections between 1972 and 2005. In 1976, having privately begun to live with a woman, she began agitating for lesbian rights in France. Her official coming-out was a declaration in print: the 1980 essay on female sexuality, <strong>De L&#8217;Amour lesbien</strong> (<em>About Lesbian Love</em>).</p>
<p>By 2000, Pastre had published a further five books, including historical works. As the titles of <strong>Homosexuality in the Ancient World</strong> and <strong>Athens and the Sapphic Peril</strong> suggest, Pastre was one of the first feminist theorists to deconstruct classical myths. Challenging the dominance of Foucault&#8217;s <strong>History of Sexuality</strong>, she argued that Foucault &#8211; and with him the male academy &#8211; had misinterpreted both ancient languages and lesbian sexuality.</p>

A year before coming out in the pages of <strong>De L&#8217;Amour lesbien</strong>, Pastre co-founded <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comit%C3%A9_d%27urgence_anti-r%C3%A9pression_homosexuelle"><strong>Comité d&#8217;Urgence Anti-Répression Homosexuelle</strong></a> (CUARH). Mobilising the smaller, disparate French gay rights groups that already existed &#8211; including David et Jonathan (gay Christians), and Beit Haverim (gay Jews) &#8211; CUARH organised a massive protest on 4th April 1981. 10,000 French LGBT people and allies joined what has since been recognised as France&#8217;s first ever gay rights march, campaigning for homosexual sex (decriminalised since the French revolution) to have the same age of consent as for heterosexuals.</p>
<p>Such was the strength of the CUARH protest that a few days later, the French president, Mitterrand, pledged to fulfil their demands. In 1982, Geneviève Pastre organised, with CUARH, France&#8217;s first ever Gay Pride celebrations; the organisation went on to fight against homophobia in the workplace and in the adoption process.</p>
<p>The 1980s were Pastre&#8217;s most prolific decade, touching almost every area of queer life in France and beyond. In 1982, within months of helping to found France&#8217;s Gay Pride movement, Pastre became the president of Frequence Gaie, FM Paris&#8217;s gay-interest radio station. Despite leaving FG in 1984, she continued to host a weekly show on Radio Libertaire, showcasing other French queer and feminist activists. In the world of publishing, Pastre not only founded Editions G. Pastre, a press dedicated to progressive and feminist authors, but also Les Octaviennes, a collective for lesbian authors active in France.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/genevieve.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="7476" data-permalink="/2011/09/21/revolting-women-genevieve-pastre/genevieve/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/genevieve.jpg?fit=128%2C130&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="128,130" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="genevieve" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/genevieve.jpg?fit=128%2C130&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/genevieve.jpg?fit=128%2C130&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/genevieve.jpg?resize=128%2C130" alt="Colour portrait photo of Genevieve&#039;s face - an older woman with short, brown hair, most of which is concealed under a blue wide-brimmed hat.

Although their most high-profile campaign &#8211; to run a candidate in the 2002 presidential election &#8211; failed, Les Mauves have campaigned successfully on national and international issues. Pastre&#8217;s party helped successfully persuade the World Health Organisation to declassify homosexuality as a mental illness; similarly, France was, in 1999, the first country to remove transsexualism from a national list of mental disorders. Pressure from Les Mauves also contributed to Amnesty International&#8217;s decision to support banned homosexuality as one of the grounds for seeking asylum.</p>
<p>At the age of 87, Pastre continues to write extensively on arts, politics and queer history: she has also organised festivals of queer culture, including the 1990 Festival européen de l&#8217;écriture gaie et lesbienne, in Paris. Active worldwide in the feminist and queer rights movements, Pastre&#8217;s influence can be felt not only in French activism, theatre, academia and publishing, but internationally. Beyond her enviable contributions to French culture, her work with Les Mauves has helped transform the status, rights and prospects of LGBT people around the world. No revolting woman could have done more.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[She was arrested and imprisoned for 10 days for daring to drive. She's not the only one.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This post is part of a series on the theme of women and protest. The full series is collected <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/tag/revolting-women/">under the tag &#8220;Revolting Women&#8221;</a>.</em></p>
<p>So, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jun/17/saudi-arabia-women-drivers-protest?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487">this happened</a>.</p>
<p>In case you&#8217;ve been on the other side of the moon these past few months, the media&#8217;s much-touted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring">Arab Spring</a> had an interesting tangent via a discussion in the Saudi Council on whether women in Saudi Arabia should be allowed the vote. They eventually decided that yes, <a href="http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/311355">they probably should&#8230; eventually</a>. We wouldn&#8217;t want to rush these things. They won&#8217;t be able to contest the elections, of course, but least &#8211; if King Abdullah considers the recommendations &#8211; they may be able to cast a vote in the municipal elections.</p>
<p>Except that this small pittance of representation didn&#8217;t seem to be <a href="http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/saudi-arabia/saudi-s-vote-for-women-comes-a-little-late-activists-say-1.818813">satisfactory for women in Saudi Arabia</a>. So&#8230; well, see for yourselves. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowNSH_W2r0">Here is Manal al-Sharif driving in Saudi Arabia, and discussing what it means for her to do so</a>.</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/sowNSH_W2r0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>She was arrested and imprisoned for 10 days for daring to drive.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s not the only one. There&#8217;s an <a href="http://www.falsafh.com/vb/t7868.html">entire site of these vids</a> (<a href="http://www.saudiwomendriving.blogspot.com/">in fact</a>, <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=saudi+women+driving&amp;hl=en&amp;biw=1259&amp;bih=599&amp;prmd=ivnsu&amp;source=univ&amp;tbm=vid&amp;tbo=u&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AJnuTY-DCYyVswamo43vAw&amp;ved=0CG4QqwQ">more than one</a>): women driving in Saudi Arabia, in protest at&#8230; well, mostly not being allowed to drive. Here&#8217;s a <a href="https://twitter.com/@women2drive">twitter feed</a> of them doing it in style. In fact, June 17 saw 30 or 40 women behind the wheel, following weeks of an online campaign that saw women taping or photographing themselves driving. (If you&#8217;re wondering whether 30-40 people is a lot, consider what happened <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-13809684">the last time women tested this ban</a>. Think about what &#8216;punishment&#8217; means in Saudi Arabia. Then try to imagine being one of those women out there on 17 June.)</p>
<p>There is, of course, a danger to conflating correlation and causality. Yes, women protesting by driving happened to take place at about the same time that women&#8217;s voting rights were being revived for discussion in Saudi Arabia. It could have been a massive coincidence, and 30-40 women, however courageous, hardly make up a political movement all by themselves. And anyway, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Saudi_Arabian_protests">what does driving have to do with political representation</a>?</p>
<p><strong>The Times</strong>&#8216;s Janice Turner is pretty clear where she stands in a now-paywalled article titled <em>The Freedom of the Road is a Feminist Issue</em>. Consider being a woman in Saudi Arabia. Ignore all the discussions about political representation for the moment, and focus instead on the daily grind. You get up, you get dressed, you have to go to work or to the market or whatever. Luckily, your husband has hired you a car with your very own (male) driver&#8230; and should he feel perfectly comfortable in <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jCjEMaKSS2DG4aQE69Xd7dF-N_OA?docId=CNG.a3efd0be8f9ab484f7bd5528447add10.3d1">sexually assaulting you</a>, there is nothing you can do about it.</p>
<p>Or how about you forgo the potential dubious safety of a hired car and opt for a taxi. Prepare to walk the streets trying to hail one: streets where your mere presence outdoors may be cast as a sexual provocation. Inevitably, in trying to lock women away &#8216;for their own protection&#8217;, lest they be seen by vociferous male eyes, the Wahhabi religious laws have created a space so deeply hostile and threatening to women that their mere presence is transgressive. It is little wonder, then, that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manal_al-Sharif">Manal al-Sharif</a> talks about how safe she feels in her car, with her doors locked.</p>
<p>A person&#8217;s first car has always symbolised their freedom: be it at 17, with their newly-minted license and the entirety of the countryside filled with welcoming ditches to drive it into, or at 50, with a newly-issued divorce and a hesitant rediscovery of independent living. A woman who has a car gets to choose the place she is occupying. If she wants to leave, she is not dependent on anyone else. What could be more terrifying to the Saudi religious leaders? Never mind that neither the Koran nor the law bans women from driving; they were so terrified at the freedom driving would afford women that they went ahead and <a href="http://www.equalitynow.org/node/837">issued a fatwa</a> just to be safe.</p>

<p>So what actually happened on June 17th, when these 30-40 women took to the road? Did governments fall or cities rock? Reports differ. For one thing, no one can agree on the number. Even the <strong>Guardian</strong> seems confused, using the 30-40 figure in one article, and &#8220;<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/jun/18/saudi-arabia-women-drivers-protest">at least 45</a>&#8221; in another. The government of Saudi Arabia is in flat-out denial, refusing to acknowledge that the protest happened at all (despite a traffic ticket being issued).</p>
<p>Two weeks on, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jun/29/saudi-women-drivers-arrested-jiddah">five of the drivers were arrested</a>, despite early comments from the government that they would allow their families to &#8216;<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jun/30/saudi-arabia-not-egypt-reform">deal with them</a>&#8216;. Despite this, campaigners are not deterred, continuing to maintain a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-13928215">significant social media presence</a>. And even before the protest took place the Shoura declare that <a href="http://arabnews.com/saudiarabia/article447421.ece">they were ready to discuss women driving &#8220;if requested</a>&#8220;. I&#8217;m thinking that women risking arrest in order to parallel park in Riyadh would qualify as such.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Manal al-Sharif hasn&#8217;t given up. Since her release from custody, the former prisoner of conscience has been <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14240340">spearheading a movement to teach more and more women how to drive</a>. With the moderate King Abdullah on the throne, and the authorities apparently turning a blind eye to the recent on-road excursions by <a href="http://saudiwomendriving.blogspot.com/2011/09/emirates-247-reports-that-during-eid-al.html">three women during Eid</a>, it looks like the driving ban may not be in place for much longer.</p>

The Trung Sisters rebelled against Han-Dynasty rule in China, 40AD; Boudicca led the Iceni tribe in uprising against occupying Roman forces in 60AD; Queen Margaret of Anjou fought for the crown, successfully, at the battle of Tewkesbury in 1471; Lorenza Avemanay led the Ecuadorian revolt against the Spanish in 1803. Women have proven themselves to be worthy opponents on the battlefield and in the halls of power. <strong>Harriet Beecher Stowe</strong>, though, did none of these things: she wasn&#8217;t possessed of great oratory skills, or handy with a sword, and she didn&#8217;t lead a great army, nor overthrow an oppressor. She wrote a book.</p>
<p>One of thirteen children, Stowe grew up in a deeply Christian family. Her father and seven brothers were all ministers, and when she married in 1836, she chose as her husband a scholar and theologian who was much respected by his peers. From the beginning of their marriage the Stowes were ardent critics of slavery. Their first home became a part of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underground_Railroad">Underground Railroad</a>, temporarily housing numerous runaway slaves on their journey to asylum in Canada. Stowe began to write articles addressing the problem of slavery and making a name for herself as an abolitionist who didn&#8217;t run with the pack.</p>
<p>This might have been the extent of Stowe&#8217;s abolitionist activities had it not been for the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850.</p>
<blockquote><p>Is it true that they have been passing a law forbidding people to give meat and drink to those poor colored folks that come along? I heard they were talking of some such law, but I didn&#8217;t think any Christian legislature would pass it! </p>
<p>&#8211; Uncle Tom&#8217;s Cabin, ch. 9</p></blockquote>
<p>The act underlined the illegality of harbouring fugitive slaves and ensured that anyone who did not aid in the capture of fugitive slaves was criminalised too. For Stowe, this was entirely at odds with the teachings of Christianity. The law may punish those who work against the slave trade, but Christian law was above that; “Love worketh no ill to his neighbour,” said the Bible, “therefore love is the fulfilling of the law” (Romans 13:10). Stowe&#8217;s abolitionist philosophy is one of the natural rights of individuals &#8211; it is the philosophy of Hobbes, of Locke and of the founding fathers and a philosophy written into the Declaration of Independence: <em>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights. That among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.<br />
</em></p>
<p>It was clear to Stowe that slavery denied huge numbers of people these rights. She wrote in a letter to Lord Denman in 1853,</p>
<blockquote><p>[A]s a woman, as a mother I was oppressed and broken-hearted, with the sorrows and injustice I saw, because as a Christian I felt the dishonor to Christianity — because as a lover of my country I trembled at the coming day of wrath. It is no merit in the sorrowful that they weep, or<br />
to the oppressed and smothering that they gasp and struggle, not to me, that I must speak for the oppressed — who cannot speak for themselves.</p></blockquote>
<p>As a woman, Stowe could not effect change by voting or being elected to public office. But she could write. When Gamaliel Bailey, editor of abolitionist newspaper the <strong>National Era</strong>, offered Stowe $100 to pen a special antislavery piece, she already had a story in mind. <strong>Uncle Tom&#8217;s Cabin</strong> was published serially in the <strong>National Era</strong> beginning in May 1851. When she began writing, Stowe could not have anticipated the impact it would have. </p>
<p>Reading the book today, the text of <strong>Uncle Tom&#8217;s Cabin</strong> contains troubling racist stereotyping in itself &#8211; I re-read it in its entirity recently and blogged the experience in more depth <a href="http://treasuryislands.wordpress.com/2011/08/28/re-reading-a-classic-uncle-toms-cabin-or-life-among-the-lowly/">here on my own blog</a>; this post forms a sort of companion piece. </p>
<p><strong>Uncle Tom&#8217;s Cabin</strong> centres around the lives of a group of slaves working on an Kentucky plantation. The book opens with a discussion between owners Shelby and Haley over the sale of two slaves. Though Shelby&#8217;s wife is not happy, the sale nevertheless goes ahead.</p>
<p>The slaves in question are the eponymous Uncle Tom, a good man and devout Christian, and young Harry, the only surviving son of house slave Eliza. The narrative follows them as they leave Kentucky, Tom on a ship bound for Ohio, and Eliza and her son as escapees pursued by professional slave catchers. Throughout their journeys Tom and Eliza witness the cruelties and indignities of slavery: Eliza is refused help for fear of repercussions; Tom witnesses a suicide and hears of slave babies bred to be sold. When he is sold to a particularly cruel master Tom finds violence not only from owners, but among the slaves themselves, an indignity that suggests that those who are oppressed by the system lose both self-respect and any perspective of right or wrong.</p>
<p>While revealing the brutalities visited upon slaves from inhumane masters, the novel also relentlessly mocks the hypocrisies of so-called &#8216;benign&#8217; slave holders, represented by Shelby, who, though they are not violent and cruel themselves, support those slave holders who are less kindly and keep the system running. Slaves were, in <strong>Uncle Tom&#8217;s Cabin</strong> and in life, under constant physical and psychological assault.</p>
<p>Stowe made sure, too, to implicate the world at large in the horrors of the slave trade. She directs the story to her readers, referring to &#8216;us&#8217; and things &#8216;we&#8217; think. Readers were therefore in cahoots with Stowe from the very beginning, so when she asks of her readers, &#8216;But sir, who makes the Trader?&#8217; (ch. 12) readers would be bound into guilt, and with good reason. Not just in America but elsewhere too, households profited from the exploitation of slaves; they bought sugar, they milled cotton. Stowe could not have used better means to galvanise support among white American moderates.</p>
<p>The novel was released as a two volume book in 1852. The original print run of 5000 was woefully inadequate: in the first year, 300,000 copies were sold in the US, more than 1 million in the UK. Opinion was divided. According to Richard Yarborough, quoted in <a href="http://www.jstor.org/pss/2927489">this paper</a> by RS Levin, freed slaves viewed the novel as &#8220;a godsend destined to mobilize white sentiment against slavery just when resistance to the southern forces was urgently needed&#8221;, while for abolitionists it was a vindication. Readers south of the Mason-Dixon Line were more likely to find the novel sensationalist and unjust &#8211; slavery was a much bigger part of their way of life.</p>
<p>Following the publication of <strong>Uncle Tom&#8217;s Cabin</strong> support for the abolition movement grew. Minstrel shows and stage plays based on the book – &#8216;Tom Shows&#8217; as they came to be known – became popular, bringing Stowe&#8217;s message to a wider audience, and transcending barriers of class and literacy. Inevitably, some Tom Shows took on a pro-slavery stance, but this does not seem to have diluted the effect of the work on the populace. The now famous author began speaking tours, even visiting the UK in her attempt to bring abolitionism to a wider and wider audience.</p>
<p>The abolitionist movement continued to grow. When Abraham Lincoln won his Presidency in 1860 it was on a platform of antislavery, so when eleven pro-slavery states seceded to form the Confederacy in 1861 war seemed suddenly inevitable. Of course, slavery was not the sole cause of the American Civil War; there was a significant difference in culture, economy and industry between Northern and Southern states and disagreements over federal rule versus state autonomy too. Despite these factors, when the fighting began it became clear: this was a battle between pro- and anti-slavery states. When Stowe visited Lincoln in 1862 he is reputed to have said to her, &#8220;So, you are the little woman who wrote the book that started this great war.&#8221;</p>
<p>Slavery was finally abolished in the United States in 1865 with the Thirteenth Amendment, which put an end to all involuntary servitude save for those convicted of a crime and freed 40,000 or so slaves that had not been granted their freedom in previous state-by-state laws.</p>
<p>In later years images from Margaret Mitchell&#8217;s adapted <strong>Gone With the Wind</strong> (1936) would supersede those of <strong>Uncle Tom&#8217;s Cabin</strong> in the popular imagination as the picture of the antebellum South. No doubt both have some degree of accuracy, but it is <strong>Uncle Tom&#8217;s Cabin</strong> that changed the opinion of a nation.</p>

<p>They meet every Wednesday at 6pm and stand around<a href="http://www.ukattraction.com/london/edith-cavell-memorial-statue.htm"> the statue of legendary badass</a> and feminist hero <a href="http://www.edithcavell.org.uk/">Edith Cavell</a>, wearing black and holding signs. They don&#8217;t speak. They have an awesome homemade banner with some very cool patchwork stitching on it.

<p>They are the <a href="http://www.womeninblack.org/en/london"><strong>Women in Black</strong></a>. Not to be confused with their <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRuHk6Drj2U">male counterparts</a> &#8211; the Women in Black are probably not our &#8216;best, last and only line of defence&#8217; against extra-terrestrial invasion, although I wouldn&#8217;t put it past them.</p>
<p>So, who are they and why is it a Found Feminism? Well, they&#8217;re an international network that offer a specific form of peaceful protest model &#8211; wear black, hold signs, don&#8217;t chant &#8211; and link up all the people (men AND women) in the world who do this or who want to do it.</p>
<p>Women in Black officially started off in the late 80s in Israel with women protesting against the occupation of Palestine, but they acknowledge their roots in much earlier female-led non-violent movements such as <a href="http://www.blacksash.org.za/">Black Sash</a> and the<a href="http://www.wilpfinternational.org/"> Women&#8217;s International League for Peace and Freedom</a>.</p>
<p>Women in Black are therefore part of a much wider story about the long-term involvement of women, and feminists, in the peace movement, in anti-war demonstrations and in alternative (including non-violent) forms of protest and revolution.</p>
<p>At a time of shouty, flash-in-the-pan protests and unpredictable acts of anger, a regular, silent protest is interesting in and of itself. It&#8217;s a reminder of the other ways to influence and change the world, as well as recognising the value of solidarity across borders. Something Edith herself would have probably approved of.</p>
<blockquote><p>Patriotism is not enough. I must have no hatred or bitterness towards anyone.</p>
<p>&#8211; Edith Cavell </p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This post is part of a series on the theme of women and protest. The full series is collected <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/tag/revolting-women/">under the tag &#8220;Revolting Women&#8221;</a>. Following on from Steve&#8217;s post yesterday about martial arts and the upper echelons of the suffragette movement, welcome back to guest blogger Libby from <a href="http://treasuryislands.wordpress.com/">TreasuryIslands</a>, in the first of two guest posts.</em></p>
<p>Monday 8th March, 1907. The Ladies&#8217; Gallery of the House of Commons is closed as a precaution as the Dickinson bill receives its second reading. The bill, which would see the enfranchisement of around a million propertied women in the UK, is talked out. In protest, the Women&#8217;s Social and Political Union (WSPU) decide to march on Westminster.</p>
<p>Twelve days later, several hundred women gather to make their discontent known. Among them are local WSPU groups from Yorkshire and Lancashire, a &#8216;clog and shawl brigade&#8217; of workers from cotton and worsted mills. The House of Commons is defended by more than 500 police.</p>
<p>Seventy-five women are arrested. The following day a photograph appears on the front page of the <strong>Daily Mirror</strong> of a young woman, flanked by a pair of police officers. Her skirts and shawl in disarray, her hair wild. She appears to be shouting. Her name is <strong>Dora Thewlis</strong>, a weaver in a Huddersfield mill. She is just sixteen years old.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/thewlis-arrest.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="7357" data-permalink="/2011/09/13/revolting-women-dora-thewlis-teenage-working-class-suffragette/thewlis-arrest/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/thewlis-arrest.jpg?fit=689%2C940&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="689,940" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="thewlis arrest" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/thewlis-arrest.jpg?fit=219%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/thewlis-arrest.jpg?fit=689%2C940&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-7357 aligncenter" title="thewlis arrest" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/thewlis-arrest.jpg?resize=413%2C564" alt="Black and white photograph of a young white woman with loose dark hair being marched through the streets by two police officers.

<p>When she appears in front of the magistrate, one Mr Horace Smith, he is aghast:</p>
<blockquote><p>The child cannot be a delegate or anything else. She doesn&#8217;t know what she&#8217;s doing. You ought to be at school. It is really a shocking thing that you should be brought up to London to be turned loose […]. Where is your Mother?</p></blockquote>
<p>Later:</p>
<blockquote><p>Here is a young girl of seventeen [in fact she is 16] enticed from her home in Yorkshire and let loose in the streets of London to come into collision with the police. It is disgraceful for everybody concerned.</p></blockquote>
<p>Like the prosecutor who, during the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/oct/22/dh-lawrence-lady-chatterley-trial">Chatterley trial</a>, asked &#8220;Is it a book you would wish your wife or servants to read?&#8221;, Smith reveals by his indignation just how out of touch the establishment is with the lives of working people. Says Jill Liddington in her book <a href="http://www.jliddington.org.uk/rebel-girls.html"><strong>Rebel Girls</strong></a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>First, men like Horace Smith had not the remotest understanding of child labour, let alone the half-time system widespread in the north. His pontification is tragically revealing about the dimensions of inequality. Second, Smith saw &#8216;young girls&#8217; and &#8216;London streets&#8217; as having only one possible reading: moral looseness and semi-prostitution. The word &#8216;entice&#8217; says it all: Dora had been &#8216;enticed&#8217; down onto the London streets, in her turn to &#8216;entice&#8217; innocent young men. […] It remained unthinkable for respectable women to demand citizenship by taking to the streets.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dora Thewlis was borne of an environment hostile towards working women; an environment that relied heavily upon the textile industry, but one in which trade unionism was heavily resisted by factory managers and owners and in which the Yorkshire Warp Twisters had fought two strikes,<br />
successfully, to prevent women entering their profession. As an active member of the Independent Labour Party (ILP), who (according to her mother) had since the age of seven, &#8216;been a diligent reader of the newspapers, [able to] hold her own in debate on politics (Liddington, p 112), Thewlis was well aware of the inequity of society.</p>
<p>For the mill workers of Yorkshire and Lancashire, the failures of capitalism were apparent in the hierarchies of the factories. Mill workers were encouraged by their physical environment to isolate themselves by specialism so that ordinary labourers were looked down upon by spinners and sorters, who in turn were sniffed at by the overseers. This segregation, inevitably, extended outside the factory walls, and for workers of different grades to socialise together was unusual. Outside of large factories small firms too held a paternalistic sway over the lives of their workers, fighting constantly to keep down costs and able to ruin the reputation of any worker that refused to toe the line. The ILP sought a number of economic reforms, summarised by Robert Haggard in <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Persistence-Victorian-Liberalism-1870-1900-Contributions/dp/0313313059">this book</a> as &#8220;an eight hour working day; the abolition of overtime and piecework; the prohibition of the employment of children; public provision for the sick, the disabled, the aged, widows and orphans [and] free, non-sectarian primary, secondary and university education&#8221;, as well as a fair minimum wage. The party was evangelical in its belief that the world could be a better place for everyone through socialism.</p>
<p>Ardently supporting the ILP, it was not surprising that Dora Thewlis would embrace suffrage with the same fervour, and she joined the Huddersfield branch of the WSPU as a founding member in December 1906.</p>
<p>So it was that Thewlis found herself arrested and remanded to Holloway. Once in prison, Thewlis was bathed, given a prison number and uniform and separated from her comrades. Inside the once belligerent, combative Thewlis grew lonely and wan, convinced she had been forgotten. Though she remained in Holloway only six days, Thelwis became a cause célèbre. Christened the &#8216;Baby Suffragette&#8217; by the <strong>Daily Mirror</strong>, she was dogged by reporters at both ends of her journey back to Huddersfield. Portentously, no members of the local WSPU came to meet her.</p>
<p>Following her return home Thewlis regained a little of her spirit. &#8220;Don&#8217;t call me the &#8216;Baby Suffragette'&#8221;, she told one reporter, &#8220;I am not a baby really. In May next year I shall be eighteen years of age. Surely for a girl that is a good age?&#8221;. The sobriquet belittled Thewlis, just as Horace<br />
Smith had, opening her up to ridicule both in the press and from her fellow suffragists. There was a feeling of alienation among the Huddersfield suffragists who felt attention had been drawn away from their cause by disputes over Thewlis&#8217; age and Mr Smith&#8217;s comments about &#8220;enticement&#8221;.</p>
<p>By August of 1907 the image of young Thewlis being arrested had been turned into a picture postcard, and, though Dora herself had remained largely quiet on the matter, relations between the Thewlis women and the WSPU had become strained. It&#8217;s difficult to know exactly what caused the tension, though Dora&#8217;s mother Eliza, who tended to claim a greater role than she ought in the branch dealings, undoubtedly did not help the situation. A letter was dispatched to the Thewlis home asking Eliza Thewlis to work agreeably or resign from the branch.</p>
<p>All Thewlis and her cohorts wanted was to be granted the right to vote. The had to abide by the law of the land, they argued, so why could they not have a hand in creating it? It is worth noting that, despite the WSPU&#8217;s significant working class membership, they did not fight for universal suffrage, but the right for women to vote on the same terms as men. It was, in the words of one nameless critic, &#8220;not votes for women, but votes for ladies&#8221;; only a meagre few would meet the property qualification required by law. Dora Thewlis, with her socialist zeal and youthful indignation, would not be one of those women.</p>
<p>The WSPU, with their motto of &#8220;Deeds Not Words&#8221; was founded in 1903, in the wake of perceived inertia in the National Union of Women&#8217;s Suffrage Societies (NUWSS). They became increasingly militant, with a policy of breaking the windows of government buildings introduced in 1908, with<br />
the first hunger strikes taking place the following year. In 1912 they began attacking the contents of post boxes, and the campaign of violence and arson escalated. The following year Emily Davison <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/03/30/deeds-not-words-emily-wilding-davison/">became a martyr to the cause</a>, dying following head injuries sustained in what is likely to have been an attempt to grab the bridle of the King&#8217;s horse at the Derby.</p>
<p>It is frequently argued that such militancy did more to harm the suffragist cause than to progress it, and that the constitutional actions of Millicent Fawcett&#8217;s NUWSS and the Women&#8217;s Freedom League did more to earn the enfranchisement of Women.</p>
<p>The Qualification of Women Act was passed in 1918, allowing female householders (or wives of householders), women with an annual household rent of at least £5, and female graduates of British universities to vote if they were over the age of 30. Thewlis, who had emigrated to Australia (where women had been granted the vote in 1901) before the outbreak of war, never saw the enfranchisement she fought for. She never returned to Britain, and died in 1976.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This post is part of a series on the theme of women and protest. The full series is collected <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/tag/revolting-women/">under the tag &#8220;Revolting Women&#8221;</a>.</em></p>
<p>Argentina, during the period from 1976-1983, was not a good place to look even remotely like a dissident. The era, known as the ‘<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_War">Dirty War</a>’, saw widespread violence carried out by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Rafael_Videla">Jorge Rafael Videla’s</a> military <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_junta">junta</a> against those it perceived as enemies of the state – students, journalists, trade unionists and Peronist guerillas (see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_of_the_Pencils">Night of the Pencils</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezeiza_massacre">Ezeiza Massacre</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margarita_Bel%C3%A9n_Massacre">Margarita Belén Massacre</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_flights">Luis Mendia’s death flights</a> for examples). Assaults, assassinations and kidnappings were rife, and somewhere between 9,000 and 30,000 people were forcibly disappeared, leaving no official trace of their fates.</p>
<p>This set the stage for the formation of a group known as the <strong>Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo</strong>, named for the plaza in central Buenos Aires where they first gathered. The Mothers are one of the more interesting protest movements of the late 20th century, and also a bunch of remarkable badasses. </p>
<p>Formed in 1977, the Mothers set out to pressure the government into admitting the fates of their disappeared children, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desaparecidos">Desaparecidos</a>. On the 30th of April that year sixteen women gathered outside the presidential palace to stage a demonstration, demanding to know what had happened to theirs sons and daughters. Consider that this was right in the middle of the Dirty War, when state-sponsored death squads were meting out harsh discipline pretty much with impunity. How staggeringly brave and determined do you have to be, at a time like that, to march up to the presidential palace and demand answers? This isn’t a movement that formed years later, in safety under a civilian government – they stood up to the military junta right from the start, despite the risks.</p>

<p>In a time when the government sought to isolate individuals, to separate and control people through application of terror, the Mothers gave a unified voice. They acted publicly, sharing their stories, gathering others to their cause. It was by no means a safe or easy course of  action (fully one quarter of the founding Mothers were also disappeared before the junta left power in 1983), but they managed to grow a movement that is still going.</p>
<blockquote><p>The ongoing work of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo has not gone on unnoticed. It has earned them international awards from bodies such as UNESCO and the European Parliament. It has also been met with harassment and repression. Three of the organization’s founding members have joined the ranks of the disappeared since its work began.</p>
<p>– <strong><a href="http://www.labournet.net/world/0001/mum1.html">Bruce Allen</a></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Since the fall of the junta and the return to civilian government, the pressure exerted by the Mothers has resulted in several hundred of the missing being identified, or their remains found. Many younger children turned out to have been given to adoptive loyalist families, and the Mothers have acted as intermediaries to help these children come to terms with their pasts and interact with both their adoptive and birth families.</p>
<p>Beyond just finding the missing, many of the Mothers have seen it as their duty to carry on the dreams of their children, to live for the causes that got them taken in the first place. To this end the group has grown to encompass other political causes, including the founding of a university, libraries and bookshops, and the provision of healthcare subsidies.</p>
<p>What makes the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo particularly interesting is the boundary-crossing nature of their protest. A lot of activist movements and protest campaigns become unfortunately mired in divisions, locking out valuable voices (see the refusal by key female American activists to accept the black suffrage movement in the early 20th century, or the frequent erasure of trans* and non-white issues among a lot of modern groups). The Mothers, by contrast, brought together several spheres of Argentinean culture. </p>

<p>Active in the central business areas of Buenos Aires, and by all accounts an urban movement, they nevertheless counted many rural Argentinians amongst their number. Age divides were crossed too, with a Grandmothers division of the group who continued the work of their kidnapped children, and looked after the offspring of disappeared Mothers.</p>
<p>Following the return to civilian government in 1983, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_of_the_Juntas">Trial of the Juntas</a> in ’85, the Mothers went international. Argentina hadn’t been the only South American country to disappear dissidents during that time (see: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Condor">Operation Condor</a>), and the Mothers sought to bring international pressure down on countries that still hadn’t come clean about their activities, particularly the Pinochet regime in Chile.</p>
<blockquote><p>
“One of the most beautiful things that came out of my work with the Grandmothers was learning that there was so much interest and solidarity from people in other parts of the world. It was an extraordinarily positive experience. We have had support from the women’s movement, from the CHA [Comité Homosexual Argentino], and from the transsexual groups.” </p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>Nélida de Navajas</strong>, quoted in Rita Arditti&#8217;s <strong>Searching for Life</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The Mothers are still active today, still working for answers about the fates of the thousands who remain unaccounted for, and still promoting the ideals and social changes their children were kidnapped for. They still march through the Plaza de Mayo every Thursday, in addition to a larger annual March of Resistance. </p>

<p>One of the 19<sup>th</sup> century’s best-loved stereotypes is that shivering waif, the Match Girl. Standing in the snow in a tattered shawl and starving to death in a picturesque way, she is well known to all of us thanks in large part to <a href="http://www.online-literature.com/hans_christian_andersen/981/">Hans Christian Anderson</a>.<sup><a href="/2011/09/06/revolting-women-the-matchgirls-strike-or-working-class-teenagers-kick-corporate-ass/#footnote_0_6095" id="identifier_0_6095" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" I am being flippant here but in fact the story reduces me to a crying mess of sentimentality and socialist idealism.

I&#8217;m not saying for a moment that life wasn&#8217;t hellish for the matchgirls, and the rest of the Victorian working classes. But I welcome any attempt to dig a little deeper than the hand-wringing <a href="http://www.bapla.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=46&amp;Itemid=89&amp;favm=2098&amp;stype=story">waifporn</a> of many contemporary accounts to uncover the experiences and agency of actual persons.</p>
<p>One famous event which lends these pathetic characters another dimension and a bit of agency is the Bow Bryant &amp; May match factory strike of 1888. The broadly accepted chain of events is this…</p>
<h3>Annie Besant</h3>
<p>Outspoken socialist, women’s rights campaigner and general lefty do-gooder <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Besant"><strong>Annie Besant</strong></a> heard a lecture by <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Wblack.htm">Clementina Black</a> about the terrible working conditions in Bryant &amp; May factories. She discovered that the women worked 14 hours a day for less than five shillings a week, and didn’t often receive this thanks to a system of fines for offences including talking, dropping matches or going to the toilet without permission.</p>

<p>Besant also learnt that the women’s health had been damaged by the phosphorous used to make the matches, which caused yellowing of the skin, hair loss and ‘phossy jaw’, a jolly name for a particularly gruesome kind of facial bone cancer.</p>
<p>Appalled, Besant went to the gates of the factory in Bow the next day and interviewed some of the women as they were leaving. Having the stories confirmed, she wrote an article for her newspaper <strong>The Link</strong> with the incendiary title ‘<a href="http://www.mernick.org.uk/thhol/thelink.html">White Slavery In London</a>&#8216;.</p>
<p>In response to the bad PR, Bryant &amp; May cleverly attempted to force their workers to sign a statement that they were happy with their working conditions. When a group of women refused to sign, the organisers of the group were sacked, and the rest of the workforce reacted: 1,400 of the women at Bryant &amp; May went on strike.</p>
<p>Cue national uproar. Besant gathered support for her campaign from a number of prominent figures who all seem to have had their own newspapers, and they used them to call for a boycott of Bryant &amp; May matches. The women at the company formed a Matchgirls&#8217; Union and Besant agreed to become its leader. After three weeks the company announced that it would re-employ the dismissed women and bring an end to the fines system. The sacked women returned in triumph.</p>
<h3>Matchwomen</h3>
<p>According to this version of events, Annie Besant encouraged and led the factory workers to strike for better conditions. Certainly the identities of the girls and women involved in the strike have been obscured by her fame.</p>

I don&#39;t know who is who I&#39;m afraid (except Besant, standing, centre)</p></div>
<p>But a new book by <a href="http://www.louiseraw.co.uk/">Louise Raw</a> claims that the impetus and leadership for the strike came from the women themselves, and Annie Besant got most of the credit because she was already notorious. And because she was middle class &#8211; there were doubts in many circles that the matchwomen themselves could have organised their way out of a paper bag without the help of a learned socialist.</p>
<p>This <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=408305&amp;sectioncode=26"><strong>Times Higher Ed</strong></a> review of <<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Striking-Light-Bryant-Matchwomen-History/dp/1441114262/ref=tmm_pap_title_0"><strong>Striking a Light: The Truth About the Match Girls Strike and the Women Behind It</strong></a> explains that the matchwomen “have not been hidden from history but hidden by history” because the standard account of events very early on became the go-to example of women’s industrial action, even to the point of cliché, so historians have avoided revising it. Until now:</p>
<blockquote><p>In a careful reconstruction of events, Raw exposes inaccuracies in the standard accounts which, while petty, suggest a lazy acceptance of a chronology that fits the conventional story. Not only was Besant not the first mover, and she was probably neither sympathetic to strike action nor optimistic about its outcome, preferring instead a boycott of Bryant and May… Raw&#8217;s revised account has the match women themselves deciding to strike, generating leaders and possessing a solidarity usually denied to unskilled workers of this era, especially female ones.</p></blockquote>
<p>BBC History magazine recorded an interview with Raw, which is available as a <a href="http://www.louiseraw.co.uk/podcastapr1a.mp3">podcast</a>. If you’re at all interested I recommend it. In the interview she names the five ‘ringleaders’ identified by Bryant &amp; May &#8211; Kate Slater, Alice Barnes, Jane Wakely, Eliza Martin, Mary Driscoll – and describes newspaper accounts about their charisma, inspiring speeches and popularity with the other factory workers. Rather wonderfully, Raw was able to find out more about these women after three of their grandchildren approached her at her talks at the <a href="http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/docklands/">Museum in Docklands</a> and the <a href="http://www.raggedschoolmuseum.org.uk/nextgen/">Ragged School Museum</a>. Local history events FTW!</p>
<p>The Matchgirls&#8217; Strike is a landmark in the history of women and protest, but also in labour history. It famously inspired the Dockers’ Strike: the organisers sought advice from the Matchgirls Union and continually referenced them in their speeches.</p>

<h2>BUT WAIT! Where is the pop culture link?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Well, I reckon the story about the ‘troublemaker’ Eva Smith who leads a factory strike in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Inspector_Calls"><strong>An Inspector Calls</strong></a> may well have been inspired by the matchgirls. Here’s a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Av9BoOCDF_4&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=506s">YouTube clip</a> of the relevant bit.</li>
<li>Secondly, in the course of my researches I discovered that there is a MUSICAL version of the matchgirl’s story, called, er, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matchgirls"><strong>The Matchgirls</strong></a>. It looks appalling. Here’s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amqqwzTITck">one of the songs</a> from it.</li>
<li>Then I found out that lovely East London history music project <strong>Songs From The Howing Sea</strong> have done a song about the strike! <a href="http://www.songsfromthehowlingsea.com/wk-27-the-matchgirls-strike-video/">Listen here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="footnotes"><li id="footnote_0_6095" class="footnote"> I am being flippant here but in fact the story reduces me to a crying mess of sentimentality and socialist idealism. There’s also a good recent <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE7CVCuMz0">Disney / Pixar animation</a>. For a horrible moment I thought they were going to happy-end it a la <strong>The Little Mermaid</strong> and <strong>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</strong> but they let her die. </li></ol>]]></content:encoded>
