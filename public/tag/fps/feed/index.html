					<description><![CDATA[It isn't as hard as you might expect to find good, feminist-friendly things to say about Borderlands 2.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This month I finally bring you <a title="Borderlands 2 website" href="http://www.borderlands2.com/us/" target="_blank"><strong>Borderlands 2</strong></a>.  I took my time, I enjoyed myself, and I promised I&#8217;d complete at least one run-through before gabbling on about it, and that I have.</p>
<h3>Borderlands 2, or &#8216;the Accidental-on-Purpose, not-so-secret, feminist game&#8217;</h3>
<p>There really is <em>a lot</em> that can be said about <strong>BL2</strong>, and although I&#8217;m not going to say it all, I&#8217;ve picked up on some points I think are more relevant for BadRep.  It isn&#8217;t, however, as hard as you might expect to find good, feminist-friendly things to say about <strong>BL2</strong>. In fact, it&#8217;s probably one of the best AAA titles in terms of its ability to give players something quite egalitarian as an overall experience.</p>
<p>Basic game-stuff first, though: keeping to form, <strong>Borderlands 2</strong> is beautiful.  Hand-painted landscapes, smooth animation, great character design, brilliant monsters and, like, a gazillion-billion guns and other loot items.  It&#8217;s an FPS/RPG that combines the best of both game styles; you can recognise the colour-coded scale of awesomeness for your loot alongside the superb right-in-there combat mechanics.  You can grind, farm, explore &#8211; whatever.  It&#8217;s fun.  A lot of fun.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/elliefront.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="12636" data-permalink="/2012/11/01/gamer-diary-what-ive-been-playing-october-2012/elliefront/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/elliefront.jpg?fit=250%2C246&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="250,246" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="elliefront" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/elliefront.jpg?fit=250%2C246&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/elliefront.jpg?fit=250%2C246&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-12636" title="elliefront" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/elliefront.jpg?resize=250%2C246" alt="Concept art of Ellie from Borderlands 2." width="250" height="246" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>It&#8217;s available on the three big platforms (PS3, Xbox 360, PC) and is big on multiplayer, though frankly it&#8217;s just as great solo. However, the one thing that annoys me with these big multi-platform titles and multiplayer is that we can&#8217;t interact with each other.</p>
<p>While I can play through <strong>Steam</strong> with one friend, my <strong>Xbox</strong> friend can&#8217;t join in and is left to languish alone with inferior loot.  Not the fault of the game &#8211; more the big console companies trying to keep their corner of the market isolated &#8211; but it&#8217;s still a letdown.</p>
<p>Anyway, these things aside, why is this such a great egalitarian game?  Put simply, it takes the piss.  Out of everyone.  On the surface of things, anyone is fair game, but(!) if you listen and observe, what I&#8217;ve noticed is that there&#8217;s a bit of a slant on the piss-takings, and it&#8217;s a positive one.  I&#8217;ll give you some examples, but from here on out, <strong>beware the spoilers.</strong></p>
<p>My two favourite NPCs are <a title="Borderlands Wikia: Ellie" href="http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Ellie" target="_blank">Ellie</a> and <a title="Borderlands Wikia: Tiny Tina" href="http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Tiny_Tina" target="_blank">Tina</a>. They&#8217;re both great examples of powerful, self-confident, self-reliant women who <em>aren&#8217;t</em> your average pin-up character and who represent integral, practical and useful components of the story &amp; mission.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re not decoration over in the corner of the room; they&#8217;re key to your success.  Ellie is a mechanic (and a bit of a whizz at that) and she&#8217;s a larger woman.  She loves it, and so does the game and its creators.</p>
<p>In the book that came with my special edition game-pack, <strong>Inside the Vault: The Art &amp; Design of Borderlands 2</strong>, one character artist has said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ellie is one of my favorites&#8230; I like that we have embraced a variety of different character shapes.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ellie.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="12637" data-permalink="/2012/11/01/gamer-diary-what-ive-been-playing-october-2012/ellie/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ellie.jpg?fit=1920%2C1080&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1920,1080" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="screenshot from Borderlands 2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ellie.jpg?fit=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ellie.jpg?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-12637" title="screenshot from Borderlands 2" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ellie-1024x576.jpg?resize=524%2C295" alt="" width="524" height="295" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ellie.jpg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ellie.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ellie.jpg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 524px) 100vw, 524px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Ellie&#8217;s dialogue is snappy, funny and generally awesome.  Some examples include: &#8220;&#8230;they like skinny chicks &#8217;cause they&#8217;s pussies!&#8221; and &#8220;My mom Moxxi always told me if I slimmed down, men&#8217;d pay me more mind.  Shows what she knows &#8211; I got these boys bending over backwards&#8230;&#8221;.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/tina.png"><img data-attachment-id="12638" data-permalink="/2012/11/01/gamer-diary-what-ive-been-playing-october-2012/tina/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/tina.png?fit=250%2C295&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="250,295" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="tina" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/tina.png?fit=250%2C295&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/tina.png?fit=250%2C295&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-12638" title="tina" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/tina.png?resize=250%2C295" alt="Tina from Borderlands 2" width="250" height="295" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>And Tina.  Tina is an early-teens girl who has been orphaned and likes to spend time having tea parties and, uh, exploding stuff.  She&#8217;s<em> the best</em> explosives expert on the planet. Even the man leading the resistance defers to her.</p>
<p>Tina&#8217;s a confusing character to meet &#8211; her speech is a little discordant with her sweet appearance &#8211; but she nevertheless maintains <strong>BL2</strong> hilarity while being totally badass.</p>
<p>Tina and Ellie are just two of the female NPCs (yup, there&#8217;s others!) but I gotta say, having played through, the women are very important in <strong>BL2</strong>. They&#8217;re powerful, proactive, and practical. They can fight, build, explode stuff and save the day &#8211; they are full and proper characters and they&#8217;re equal (if not more awesome) than their male counterparts.</p>
<p>Even a rather minor female NPC adds to the all-round feminine badassery by &#8220;accidentally&#8221; giving you coordinates to mortar a very misogynist fellow into tiny pieces.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s great is that while the game&#8217;s pleasing me by being fair with its female characters, it&#8217;s also very subtly passing on the message that misogyny and sexism isn&#8217;t cool and isn&#8217;t funny.  Plenty of anti-egalitarian types rear their heads in the story, but they all get punished in-game. I think that&#8217;ll go a long way to dissuading that sort of behaviour in the audience &#8211; and hopefully show other developers that women can be awesome too.</p>
<h3>Deadlight, or &#8216;the obligatory, festivity-themed title that&#8217;s actually pretty awesome&#8217;</h3>
<p>Finally, in the spirit of all things spooky, there&#8217;s <a title="Deadlight website" href="http://www.deadlightgame.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Deadlight</strong></a>, which recently ported across to <strong>Steam</strong> from <strong>Xbox Live Arcade</strong> (released on Steam 25/10/2012). Developed by <a title="Tequila Works website" href="http://www.tequilaworks.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Tequila Works</strong></a> alongside <strong>Microsoft Studios</strong>, <strong>Deadlight</strong> is a tense indie zombie-survival offering set in post-apocalyptic 1980s Seattle.  You play Randall Wayne, who&#8217;s been separated from his wife and daughter, battling and evading the &#8216;shadows&#8217; as he navigates a ruined, hazardous cityscape to reunite his family.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a simple premise by all accounts, and we&#8217;ve certainly seen plenty of zombie themes in recent years across the entertainment spectrum &#8211; but don&#8217;t let that put you off.</p>
<p><strong>Deadlight</strong> is a side-scroller with a dark, moody art style reminiscent of <a title="LIMBO website" href="http://limbogame.org/" target="_blank"><strong>LIMBO</strong> </a>. It doesn&#8217;t feel too distant from the survivalist title <a title="I Am Alive website" href="http://iamalive-game.ubi.com/iamalive/en-gb/index.aspx" target="_blank"><strong>I Am Alive</strong></a>, which also requires you to focus on your stamina levels to avoid falling of buildings or running out of energy mid-fight.  Similarly, you have limited weaponry and ammo (only what you can salvage on your way) so a lot of the time you have to make do without, meaning you can&#8217;t go full force forward shooting everything that moves. Nor can you charge about with an axe and splatter everything, because that runs your stamina down pretty sharpish.</p>
<p>Running, climbing and hiding are some of the best options, but there&#8217;s also environmental elements you can use to your advantage.  Zombies aren&#8217;t smart: if you jump over a hole in the floor, they&#8217;ll just fall in it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/deadlight1.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="12643" data-permalink="/2012/11/01/gamer-diary-what-ive-been-playing-october-2012/deadlight-2/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/deadlight1.jpg?fit=1920%2C1080&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1920,1080" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="deadlight" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/deadlight1.jpg?fit=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/deadlight1.jpg?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-12643" title="deadlight" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/deadlight1-1024x576.jpg?resize=553%2C311" alt="" width="553" height="311" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/deadlight1.jpg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/deadlight1.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/deadlight1.jpg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 553px) 100vw, 553px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Without giving away too much, zombies aren&#8217;t your only problem in <strong>Deadlight</strong>, and not every moment is spent dashing about.  It&#8217;s good fun and manages to keep up the tension without being so nerve-racking you log off<em> (I&#8217;m looking at you, <a title="Amnesia website" href="http://www.amnesiagame.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Amnesia</strong></a>&#8230; you too, <a title="Slender website" href="http://slendergame.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Slender</strong></a>!)</em>.</p>
<p>At under a tenner full price (£9.99) it&#8217;s not bad value either, but if you&#8217;re quick there&#8217;s 15% off on Steam until the end of today (£8.49), so it&#8217;s worth checking out for a little Hallowe&#8217;en amusement.  For those of you who prefer XBLA, it&#8217;s<strong> 1,200</strong> Microsoft Points.</p>
<p>If you aren&#8217;t tickled by <strong>Deadlight</strong>, don&#8217;t forget, Thanksgiving is nigh approaching (22/11/12) so keep a look out in November for more sales all over the place from US-centric platforms and digital management systems!</p>
