					<description><![CDATA[*Dramatic pause* Feminism killed chivalry! Gasp. But you knew that already.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chivalry is dead, I&#8217;m told. And now you are all conveniently gathered here in the lobby of this stylish hotel / bar of this cruise ship / dining car of this luxury train I am ready to unmask the culprit. Yes, she&#8217;s here in the room with us. *Dramatic pause* Feminism killed chivalry!</p>
<p>Gasp.</p>
<p>But you knew that already. It&#8217;s the least mysterious murder mystery ever. Even <a title="Wikipedia - Hastings" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Hastings" target="_blank">Hastings</a> could have cracked it (well, maybe). Just google &#8220;chivalry is dead!&#8221; and you&#8217;ll find plenty of witnesses to testify to the fact that it was feminism what done it.</p>
<p>It is also, apparently, a tragic case of mistaken identity as countless Daily Fail and Torygraph writers assert that chivalry wasn&#8217;t even sexist. It&#8217;s just about being nice to women. Isn&#8217;t that what you want, slavering harpy hordes? For us to be nice to you?</p>

I spend quite a lot of time arguing about gender on the internet, as you might imagine. And recently the most inflammatory topic seems to be chivalry. Sparked by a call from Graham Linehan on Twitter for chivalry to be resurrected (see <a title="Glinner twitter status" href="https://twitter.com/#!/Glinner/status/132627658944151552" target="_blank">here</a> and <a title="Glinner status 2" href="https://twitter.com/#!/Glinner/status/132630145675694080" target="_blank">here</a>) I&#8217;ve gotten into a number or heated discussions disputing the value of chivalry today. Sadly, I believe rumours of the death of chivalry to have been greatly exaggerated.</p>
<p>Some people I spoke to claimed that they were defending chivalry as a general approach, towards all genders. But isn&#8217;t that just &#8216;not being an arse&#8217;? Why does it need a special name? Especially one with such deeply gendered associations. However pure the intention, bringing chivalry back from the dead serves no one. It&#8217;s a problematic idea in any context because it fetishises an imbalance of power. It&#8217;s fairness as charity rather than right, in which a privileged group extend a superficial form of power to another group along highly formalised lines.</p>
<p>As it is most commonly understood, as a code of behaviour for men towards women, chivalry is sexist. As <a title="Traditional romance is creepy" href="http://pandagon.net/index.php/site/comments/traditional_romance_is_creepy" target="_blank">Amanda Marcotte</a> says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Chivalry is a set of behaviors where men feign servitude and humility towards women, but in practice they tend to actually reinforce men&#8217;s greater social status.</p></blockquote>
<p>In my recent conversations I&#8217;ve been confirmed in my suspicion that there are a lot of Nice Guys out there who don&#8217;t want to hear this. I think the most common objections I&#8217;ve encountered go like this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;But I believe in equality/I&#8217;m a feminist, how dare you tell me I&#8217;m sexist just for being nice to women? That doesn&#8217;t fit with my carefully constructed self-image *cries*&#8221;</p>
<p>Following codes of behaviour towards women forged hundreds of years ago isn&#8217;t really an act of gender resistance. Sorry. Try turning your deeply-held commitment to equality to use by being considerate and respectful to everybody. If you already are: great! Why not drop the silly name for it?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;But I&#8217;m only being nice. Would you rather I punched you in the face rather than opening the door for you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Are you nice in this way to everyone? If so, good for you! If not: lots of women find chivalric or &#8216;gentlemanly&#8217; behaviour patronising or irritating at best, and creepy and coercive at worst.  Of course I prefer chivalry to brazen misogyny, but those aren&#8217;t the only choices, people. And both enshrine an archaic, damaging attitude toward women and reinforce the idea that women should be treated as women rather than as people.</p>
<p>You may have seen the pithy, ironic poems by suffragist Alice Duer Miller that Lili Loofbourow shared on the <a title="Hairpin - Are Women People?" href="http://thehairpin.com/2012/01/are-women-people" target="_blank">Hairpin</a> the other day. Her meditation on chivalry is one of my favourites, and neatly captures the problems with the idea:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s treating a woman politely<br />
As long as she isn&#8217;t a fright:<br />
It&#8217;s guarding the girls who act rightly,<br />
If you can be judge of what&#8217;s right;<br />
It&#8217;s being—not just, but so pleasant;<br />
It&#8217;s tipping while wages are low;<br />
It&#8217;s making a beautiful present,<br />
And failing to pay what you owe.</p></blockquote>
<p>Exactly. Women are owed equality. In the context of hundreds of years of struggle to be taken seriously, for agency, autonomy, self-representation, and social, political and economic power, the feeble gift of a seat or a door held open can feel like a joke. Or even an insult. For me it acts as a reminder of the social expectation &#8211; even now &#8211; <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/12/20/an-alphabet-of-femininism-12-l-is-for-lady/">to be ladylike</a>. Grateful, graceful, delicate. Powerless.</p>
<h3>Epilogue</h3>
<p>Besides, chivalry can quickly become desperately tedious, as <a title="Hark! A Vagrant" href="http://harkavagrant.com/" target="_blank">Kate Beaton</a> understands:</p>
