										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A wise man<sup><a href="/2012/10/22/found-feminism-rubber-face-putin/#footnote_0_12353" id="identifier_0_12353" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" Terry Pratchett, THUD (particularly in the form of Granny Weatherwax, he&rsquo;s the source of a lot of useful moral philosophy). ">1</a></sup> once said that you ignore the writing on the walls at your peril. I hope the same is true of stickers.</p>
<p>In a world where it&#8217;s increasingly hard to get your message across, and available methods of communication are becoming more and more sophisticated, it&#8217;s refreshing to see a return to the simple things in life.</p>
<p>Like slapping a sticker somewhere nice and prominent that screams <em>FREE PUSSY RIOT</em> in fat felt tip pen.</p>
<p>I found this beauty a couple of months ago whilst walking across the Golden Jubilee pedestrian bridge. Sitting loud and proud, obviously homemade, with bright colours and a take-no-prisoners message.</p>

<p>So, why is this a Found Feminism?</p>
<p>Well, obviously there&#8217;s the show of support for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pussy_Riot" target="_blank">Pussy Riot</a> and the spreading of their message. Whoever slapped this on the wall was inspired to make and display the sticker themselves. I hope there are hundreds of them stuck around London. I only found the one. I hope other people find more. I hope they make their own.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also going to add points for the artwork, done in a way that echoes feminist punk stylings. It&#8217;s that hand-drawn aesthetic of &#8220;we did this in our bedroom&#8221; personal creation. It mirrors the hand-knitted balaclavas of the band members, and it&#8217;s the heart and soul of grassroots movements.</p>
<p>Plus, it&#8217;s funny.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying that feminism should be side-splitting all the time, although I do dislike that stereotype about feminists as po-faced, dungarees-wearing, yoghurt-plaiting monsters<sup><a href="/2012/10/22/found-feminism-rubber-face-putin/#footnote_1_12353" id="identifier_1_12353" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" Actually, I really like dungarees, and would quite happily wear them, especially for their iconic status in (mis)representing feminism. But that&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m a real person and not a stereotype! I cannot plait yoghurt, however. ">2</a></sup> who hate all fun and all jokes. But being able to make someone smile when you get your point across can be valuable &#8211; and who wouldn&#8217;t grin at this sticker, with its cheerful two fingers up to one of the most terrifying and powerful men in the world? Doesn&#8217;t matter how strong you think you are, Mr Putin &#8211; the writing on the wall in London thinks you&#8217;re a dick.</p>
<p>Finally, there&#8217;s the political message here. The sticker, and Pussy Riot, are part of a rekindling of the political power of feminism, reminding us all that there&#8217;s more we can do (much, much more) than form elegant critiques of the use of the female nude in art for the Sunday edition of the national newspapers.</p>
<p>There are problems out in the world that an active, aware and politicised feminist movement can work to solve. Should work to solve. And the fact that someone with a few highlighter pens and a handful of stickers is getting out there and having a go, in their own way, at doing it should put a rocket under those of us who have more reach and power to do what we can.</p>
<p>So yeah, fuck rubber face Putin.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[From the past few months of coverage and debate, here are just a few things which have interested me on the complexities of Pussy Riot’s background and media presentation.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since we first wrote on Pussy Riot <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/02/06/revolting-women-slight-return-russias-pussy-riot/">back in February</a>, widespread attention has been given to the subsequent arrest, trial and imprisonment of three members of the group, while <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/15/us-russia-protest-idUSBRE88E06R20120915">mass anti-government protest continues in Russia</a>. From the past few months of coverage and debate, here are just a few things which have interested me on the complexities of Pussy Riot’s background and media presentation.</p>
<p>This (mildly NSFW) video is кисья ересь (Heresy of Little Cats), by the Russian electro-punk band Barto:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/oyMMqUzRa1A?rel=0" frameborder="0" width="420" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>As a non-speaker of Russian who hasn’t found the lyrics anywhere, I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a lot I’m not getting, but I like the song, the band are <a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/arts_n_ideas/article/electro-punk-barto-is-a-band-with-an-ideology/425794.html">pretty admirable</a>, and I like the video’s satirical emphasis on the patriarchal intertwining of political and religious authorities – the formal alliance of Putin’s government and the Russian Orthodox Church, making it possible for civil disobedience to be framed as blasphemy, was a point of contention highlighted by the Pussy Riot trial.</p>
<p>I found the song via <a href="http://myplacefp7.wordpress.com/2012/08/17/get-on-the-way-pussy-riot/">this post</a>, which discusses the relatively muted response by the Russian underground music scene to the group’s trial and imprisonment. It also corrects the impression of Pussy Riot as (merely?) a feminist punk band, when they are more a product of the intersection between political activism and performance art:</p>
<blockquote><p>As a matter of fact Pussy Riot, although calling themselves a punk-band and using the sign of punk in their performances, never belonged to the Russian punk scene. They consider themselves as art-actionists, clearly place themselves in the context of contemporary Russian actionism, quoting the names of Prigov, Brener, Kulik and other art-provocateurs of the 1990s.</p></blockquote>
<p>So Pussy Riot’s frequently mentioned connection with riot grrrl has more to do with the latter’s existence as a DIY subculture involving zines, art, détournement and activism, than with music alone. Which is fair enough; back in the 90s, one of the odder of Courtney Love’s swipes at Kathleen Hanna, in fact, was that “She&#8217;s not really in a band&#8230; She&#8217;s a political activist who took a bunch of women&#8217;s studies classes.&#8221; On the subject of Pussy Riot, Hanna herself had <a title="Kathleen Hanna" href="http://www.kathleenhanna.com/seriously-they-are-in-a-fucking-cage/" target="_blank">this</a> to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>What if people all over the world started their own performance groups, bands, art collectives, etc… and called them things like Pussy Riot Olympia. Pussy Riot, Athens Greece, Pussy Riot Paris, etc….And maybe if this trial turns out as the prosecutors want it to, with the women getting at least 3 years, we all play benefits and go to Russia en masse under the banner that we are all Pussy Riot, Yoko Ono could be in Pussy Riot, Patti Smith could be wearing a mask next to a troupe of girls from Tennesee storming the Cathedral of Christ the Savior screaming “We are all Pussy Riot!!!”</p></blockquote>
<p>As I wrote in February, it makes sense to consider Pussy Riot in the context of the former Soviet Union’s <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/adamcurtis/2012/01/the_years_of_stagnation_and_th.html">long and fascinating history</a> of political protest coalescing around<em> avant garde</em> art and music, especially punk. The Western media, perhaps understandably, tended instead to present the band in more straightforward and simplistic terms – rendering them more comprehensible to a Western audience, sure, but often in a less than helpful manner. I’d been hoping someone would pick up on the patronising and infantilising aspects of much of the media presentation of Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, Maria Alyokhina and Yekaterina Samutsevich, and, in <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/08/manic-pixie-dream-dissidents-how-the-world-misunderstands-pussy-riot/261309/">this article</a>, Sarah Kendzior nails it:</p>
<blockquote><p>Imagine this: The three men sit in court, awaiting their verdict. The youngest, a experienced dissident described by the media as a “sultry sex symbol” with “Angelina Jolie lips”, glances at his colleague, an activist praised by the Associated Press for his “pre-Raphaelite looks”. Between them sits a third man, whose lack of glamour has led the New Republic to label him “the brain” and deem his hair a “poof of dirty blonde frizz”. The dissidents – or “boys” as they are called in headlines around the world – have been the subject of numerous fashion and style profiles ever since they first spoke out against the Russian government. “He’s a flash of moving color,” the New York Times writes approvingly about their protests, “never an individual boy.” If this sounds ridiculous, it should – and not only because I changed the gender… Pussy Riot identifies as feminist, but you would never know it from the Western media, who celebrate the group with the same language that the Russian regime uses to marginalize them. The three members of Pussy Riot are “girls”, despite the fact that all of them are in their twenties and two of them are mothers. They are “punkettes”, diminutive variations on a 1990s indie-rock prototype that has little resemblance to Pussy Riot’s own trajectory as independent artists and activists.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, as Kendzior also points out, Pussy Riot have far more pressing concerns than being mischaracterized in the press. But:</p>
<blockquote><p>Pussy Riot also tells us a lot about how we see non-Western political dissent in the new media age, and could suggest a habit of mischaracterizing their grave mission in terms that feel more familiar but ultimately sell the dissidents short: youthful rebellion, rock and roll, damsels in distress.</p></blockquote>
<p>A lot of this sentiment is familiar: an impulse to treat protest in which women, particularly young women, are prominent, as fun, flippant, and fundamentally unserious. It’s the reverse of the censorious and sensationalist ‘Rage of the Girl Rioters’ response to the 2010 UK student protests. In the case of Pussy Riot, arguments for their sympathetic treatment are often explicitly predicated on the power imbalance involved – they are ‘just’ ordinary women (or indeed ‘girls’), what threat to the state can they possibly pose? – which surely entrenches the idea of women as both relatively powerless and harmless, rather than enabling any sort of feminist empowerment. Away from such frustrating portayals, however, there’s something to be said for the earlier stages of Pussy Riot’s trajectory, which offer examples both of how music can form part of a wider oppositional movement and for how women’s protest can be collective and anonymous, with no need of iconic or martyred figureheads.</p>
<p>And yes, I do realise this post can be summarised as: &#8220;Pussy Riot? Preferred their earlier work, before they got so commercial&#8221;. So it goes.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Pussy Riot, like the Sex Pistols, have a name designed to make headlines, and a bit more political substance to back up the sensationalism. Formed in Moscow last September, they've come to prominence in the UK media.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>They decline to reveal the smallest details, aiming to maintain total secrecy. They will say only that most of the band members met at the small protests held by Russia’s once-feeble opposition, from monthly illegal demonstrations calling for the right to assembly to banned gay pride marches.

&#8211; <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/feb/02/pussy-riot-protest-russia"><strong>Guardian</strong>, 2nd February 2012</a></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://pussy-riot.livejournal.com/profile"><strong>Pussy Riot</strong></a>, like the Sex Pistols, have a name designed to make headlines, and a bit more political substance to back up the sensationalism. Formed in Moscow last September, this offshoot of Russia’s complex and fractured political scene has come to prominence in the UK media in the context of <a href="http://www.channel4.com/news/undemocratic-putin-sparks-russias-opposition">protests</a> against political corruption which have been gaining in volume and intensity after parliamentary elections last December. In mid-January, one of the collective’s impromptu guerrilla gigs, taking place on Red Square opposite the Kremlin, ended with its members <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/9028106/Russian-all-girl-punk-band-Pussy-Riot-arrested-for-performing-Vladimir-Putin-song.html">detained by police</a>.</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/qEiB1RYuYXw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/feb/03/pussy-riot-kremlin-protest-riot-grrrl">Laura Barton in the <strong>Guardian</strong></a>, picking up on the band’s citing of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bikini_Kill">Bikini Kill</a> as an inspiration, offers a slightly short-sighted view of 90s Riot Grrrl as an antecedent for the expression of &#8216;an alternative female voice&#8217;. While the group clearly do reference Riot Grrrl’s &#8216;tone of wild irreverence&#8217;, it also makes sense to consider Pussy Riot in the context of the former Soviet Union&#8217;s long and fascinating history of political protest coalescing around <em>avant garde</em> art and music, especially punk. Adam Curtis&#8217; <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/adamcurtis/2012/01/the_years_of_stagnation_and_th.html">recent blog</a> is an interesting attempt to make sense of this sort of determinedly oppositional culture which has been notable by its <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/nov/10/protest-music-akala-grace-petrie">relative absence</a> from the UK&#8217;s current wave of socio-political protest. Similarly, the clash of sartorial signifiers which Pussy Riot provide by combining miniskirts and stockings with ski-masks and balaclavas could be a legacy of Riot Grrl too, but as a practical measure it has as much in common with other Anonymous-style contemporary protest movements, not to mention the general history of <a href="http://theoccupiedtimes.co.uk/?p=2259">masking and disguise in protest</a>.</p>
<p>Russia does have a long tradition of women in protest, notably the <a href="http://www.oocities.org/mushkah/WomenRevolution.html">1917 revolution </a>in which women played a prominent part, encouraged by the <a href="http://writerinterviews.blogspot.com/2008/06/ana-siljak.html">intersection </a> of socialism with many of the goals of women’s liberation. Pussy Riot cite this ‘deep tradition&#8230; of gender and revolution – we&#8217;ve had amazing women revolutionaries.’ They add that ‘the revolution should be done by women&#8230; For now, they don&#8217;t beat or jail us as much’. This assertion ties in with <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-sUOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA144&amp;lpg=PA144&amp;dq=women+protesters+history+impunity&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gfiH9oiQKN&amp;sig=RQ5cWgISBTk4MMmPz-6sYc8joT8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=54EuT7eMAuit0QX_lLGtCA&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=women%20protesters%20history%20impunity&amp;f=false">historical debates</a> on the ability of women to take part in protest or civil disobedience with a greater degree of impunity than men &#8211; an ideal which <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-16267436">isn&#8217;t always borne out</a> by the treatment of female protesters.</p>
<p>Contemporary Russian politics &#8211; like any &#8211; are <a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v34/n01/stephen-holmes/fragments-of-a-defunct-state">not a straightforward matter</a>, and the extent of Pussy Riot&#8217;s relevance and representativeness remains to be seen. But in a context where growing and disparate opposition groups are encountering heavy and often violent repression across the world, the ways in which women participate in protest, and the styles of self-expression they employ, are always worth noting.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia, 1942. Not a good place to be. </p>
<p>A year into the war with Germany, the German 6<sup>th</sup> Army surrounding Stalingrad, millions dead and countless more dying of starvation and disease. Supplies and equipment were running low and the need for people to throw into combat was soaring. These were the conditions that gave rise to some of the most daring and impressive pilots ever, the 588<sup>th</sup> Night Bomber Regiment, nicknamed the Night Witches by the German forces. The name alone pretty much conveys how ridiculously amazing these women were, but let’s go into a bit more detail.</p>
<p>Formed in October of 1941, the Night Witches were an all female bomber regiment tasked with precision bombing<sup><a href="/2011/05/27/unsung-heroes-the-night-witches/#footnote_0_3671" id="identifier_0_3671" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" Precision bombing differs from strategic bombing in that the bombs are aimed for individual targets as opposed to mass releasing them over an area, resulting in less collateral damage. It&rsquo;s hard to do in the best of conditions, let alone an ageing biplane at night. ">1</a></sup> runs against German military targets. The formation of the group took some time, as the move to recruit female combat pilots had initially been rejected, with one recruiting officer quoted as saying “Things may be bad but we&#8217;re not so desperate that we&#8217;re going to put little girls like you up in the skies. Go home and help your mother.” This in spite of the fact that many young Russian women had more piloting experience than the pilots of the front line fighter regiments thanks to the Osoaviakhim, a paramilitary flying club that provided free training to Soviet boys and girls in the 1920s and 30s.</p>
<blockquote><p>Soviet military officials then, as US military officials now, questioned whether it was strategically or morally appropriate to send women into combat. But the Night Witches proved to themselves and a skeptical country that their gender made no difference in the defense of one&#8217;s home.</p>

In 1938 Rakova had taken part in a record breaking non-stop flight across Russia. Somewhere over Siberia, the plane began to ice up and lose altitude, forcing the three-woman crew to jettison everything they could to lose weight and gain height. Eventually Rakova herself parachuted out of the plane to allow her two co-pilots to complete the trip. Jumping out of a plane over Siberia at night is the aviation equivalent of Lawrence Oates&rsquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going outside, I may be some time.&rdquo; ">2</a></sup>. The selection process for the 588<sup>th</sup> (and its companion squads, the 586<sup>th</sup> Fighters and the 587<sup>th</sup> Dive Bombers) was gruelling, the young women going through two years&#8217; worth of training in just six months. Up to fourteen hours a day were spent in the air,  including night flights and simulated dogfights. By June 1942, they were ready to fight against the formidable might of the German invasion.</p>
<p>The Night Witches were not a well equipped regiment. Wearing hand-me-down uniforms from male pilots (boots were reportedly stuffed with paper and fabric to make them fit), they flew in aging Polikarpov PO-2 biplanes. The PO-2s were about as basic as a plane could get and still technically qualify as a plane. First built in 1928, they consisted of fabric strung over a wooden frame, and lacked any but the most rudimentary of instrumentation. There was no radio to communicate with ground control, and navigation was done with a stopwatch and a map – just a normal map, not even a flight chart. The planes carried no guns and only had enough weight allowance to take two bombs up on a flight, forcing the Night Witches to make multiple sorties in a single night, returning to base each time to collect more bombs.</p>
<p>The one thing the PO-2 had going for it, and which the Night Witches used to full effect, was its remarkable maneuverability. With a top speed of around 95mph, the plane was slower than the slowest speed a German fighter could maintain (its stall speed), allowing them to pull tight, evasive circles that the faster German craft couldn’t match. Combine this with the impressive <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nap-of-the-earth">nap-of-the-earth</a> piloting skills that allowed the Night Witches to get closer to the ground than the planes of the Luftwaffe could manage, and shooting down a PO-2 from the air became a challenging prospect. There was, supposedly, a promise to award an Iron Cross to any Luftwaffe pilot who actually managed to bring down a Night Witch.</p>

The traditional tactic for dealing with this had been to fly directly towards the target and hope to get your bombs away before the flak could blast you out of the air. It wasn’t the most successful tactic. The Night Witches developed a far more effective method for getting past the circus of flak: flying in groups of three, two planes would approach the target and wait for the searchlights to pick them up. These two would then split apart and manoeuvre around the target, drawing the attention of the cannons. The third plane, having waited behind, would cut their engines and glide in to deliver the bombs. This was repeated until each of the three planes had made a bombing run. The mind boggles at the sheer level of stone-cold bravery needed to repeatedly offer yourself as a distraction to dozens of flak cannons, protected only by a flimsy frame of wood and fabric, and to keep doing that night after night.</p>
<p>At its largest the Night Witches&#8217; regiment consisted of 80 flying crew, plus ground support. By the end of the war they had collectively flown over 23,000 bombing runs. The surviving pilots had all flown around 1,000 missions each by 1945 (for sake of comparison, Colonel Don Blakelee, who had more missions for the USAF than anyone else in WW2, completed 500). Thirty of them had died in combat, and over a quarter of the pilots had been awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union.</p>
