					<description><![CDATA[Recently I was having a wee listen to PJ Harvey  It shouldn't sound unusual, and it occurred to me that I'd not much on the subject of how female desire's presented in pop songs BY WOMEN.
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Here&#8217;s a guest post from author <a href="http://delilahdesanges.wordpress.com/"><strong>Delilah Des Anges</strong></a>. If you have a guest post brewing in your brain, you know what to do: pitch us at <a href="mailto:badrepeditors@gmail.com?Subject=Pitch">badrepeditors@gmail.com</a>.</em></p>
<p>In terms of consumption and emotional language, the pop song occupies a similar status to the sonnet. Well, not exactly, but certainly for the purpose of romance or desire, pop lyrics are an absolute boon for the tongue-tied (a group which includes &#8220;most of the English population&#8221;). They&#8217;re used to express whatever happens to be lurking unformed in the minds of the listener, and as a point of identification when the lurking stuff has been given a concrete identity.</p>
<p>Reams have been written about the depiction of women in pop music by male songwriters and the presentation of women by the music industry, but recently I was having a wee listen to PJ Harvey (while drunk in someone&#8217;s living room in Portsmouth on a Saturday night, because I am very cool) and it occurred to me that I&#8217;d not seen as much on the subject of how female desire&#8217;s presented in pop songs BY WOMEN.</p>
<p>This thought came up because <strong>This Is Love</strong> felt like an anomaly: it presented desire as active on the part of the female narrator. PJ Harvey&#8217;s persona for the song has sexual agency, and longings that do not centre around waiting for someone else to make a move. She uses the phrase &#8220;I want&#8221; and backs it up with action: &#8220;to chase you round the table, wanna touch your head&#8221;, and in that &#8220;wanna touch your&#8221; she rather casually and without fuss flips the entire common model of heterosexual desire on its head by pointing out that women also want to touch, as well as being touched.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/STxXS5lLunE" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>It shouldn&#8217;t sound unusual, and yet at the time of listening it was borderline revolutionary, at least to me. There are other lines from the song which imply action: &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe that the axis turns on suffering when you taste so good&#8221;; suggestive of all kinds of sexual acts, instigated by and controlled by the narrator, but nothing else is quite as direct as that seemingly harmless &#8220;wanna touch your head&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>This Is Love</strong> is not unique, but on examination it becomes harder to find other songs which inhabit the same active, instigating desire.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/KUgvVAFFzN8" frameborder="0" width="480" height="360"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>I Just Wanna Make Love To You</strong> does, but even the Divinyls&#8217; famously salacious anthem to female masturbation and banned song <strong>I Touch Myself</strong> is self-contained sexuality; the desire is there, but it is self-directed. The narrator says nothing of what she wants to do to the object of the song, only what the thought of him makes her do to herself!</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/wv-34w8kGPM" frameborder="0" width="480" height="360"></iframe></p>
<p>Interestingly, when the object of desire is no longer male, the desire becomes more active in its expression: contentious and open to a variety of interpretations, Katy Perry&#8217;s <strong>I Kissed A Girl</strong> does at least carry the flow of action from the narrator to her object of desire: Katy KISSED a girl, rather than being kissed BY a girl, as so many heroines of pop songs are kissed BY a boy rather than kissing him.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/llmGx2WHeww" frameborder="0" width="480" height="360"></iframe></p>
<p>In a song of the same name, Jill Sobule&#8217;s narrator makes the same distinction: Jill KISSES Jenny, the narrator as the actor rather than the acted-upon.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/8FdwUGwasck" frameborder="0" width="480" height="360"></iframe></p>
<p>This is a small sample to draw a conclusion from, but it is intriguing that female desire is more acceptable as active, instigating, and potentially dominant when the object of the woman&#8217;s desire is also female. The repurposing of songs originally intended for male singers often underscores this, as in Patti Smith&#8217;s cover of <strong>Gloria</strong>.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/JL2I1krvhIE" frameborder="0" width="480" height="360"></iframe></p>
<p>There are songs with male narrators in which the instigation of action is undertaken by the female half of the heterosexual proto-couple (usually because the narrator is far too shy or lacking in confidence, rather than because of any societal prohibition on his asking her out): the main contender in this category is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FC3y9llDXuM"><strong>Teenage Dirtbag</strong> by Wheatus</a>. A casual glance over popular music seems to reveal far more male references to female desire (&#8220;she wants me&#8221;) than female references to female desire (&#8220;I want him&#8221;).</p>
<p>PJ Harvey is not, of course, the first or only female artist to sing about desire. Ani Difranco has filled several albums with heartfelt songs cataloging the effects of desire on the psyche: primarily in the aftermath. Ani writes about regret or lack thereof, but rarely if at all about the white-hot moment of simple wanting.</p>
<p>By now there&#8217;s a good chance you&#8217;re wondering how anyone could skip over Bikini Kill on this subject: they have a song <em>entitled</em> <strong>I Like Fucking</strong> &#8211; surely this must qualify for a candid and unabashed demonstration of naked female desire?</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/kwh7iilWrp0" frameborder="0" width="480" height="360"></iframe></p>
<p>Well, yes and no. Riot Grrrl has an agenda which is unshy of communicating, and sexuality is, as all other aspects of feminine experience, politicised. The song itself discusses internal obstacles to feeling and acting upon desire, the ubquity of rape, and the &#8220;radical possibilities of pleasure&#8221;, which while a notable feminist sentiment on the reclamation of sexuality, is a far cry from Harvey&#8217;s &#8220;I just want to sit here and watch you undress&#8221;. Politicised recognition of the rightness of female desire and its value is highly important, but isn&#8217;t quite the same thing as an unselfconscious expression of that desire.</p>
<p>Someone else who believes in the radical possibilities of pleasure, even if she doesn&#8217;t phrase it that way, is Rihanna. In <strong>Shut Up And Drive</strong>, she creates a shallow but effective metaphor in which she is a car to be driven: it is potent, referencing power and femininity, but ultimately it is &#8211; no matter how transparent and brazen &#8211; a metaphor and rerouting of desire through the stalking-horse of car culture, rather than the bald, outright statement of <strong>This Is Love</strong>.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/up7pvPqNkuU" frameborder="0" width="640" height="360"></iframe></p>
<p>I could go on, but I&#8217;m sure the general idea is clear. That was my little radio revolution, thanks to Polly Harvey, and with any luck I&#8217;ve given you something to think about too.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Delilah Des Anges</strong> is given to unnecessarily close examination of song lyrics, but excuses it by writing <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=delilah+des+anges+poetry&amp;rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Adelilah+des+anges+poetry&amp;ajr=0">poems</a>. She also writes <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=delilah+des+anges">novels</a>, for which she has rather less excuse.</li>
</ul>

<p>If I asked you to hum a song by <strong>The Bangles</strong>, you could probably do it, right? Perhaps <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWP-AsG5DRk" target="_blank">this one</a>. What about <strong>Bananarama</strong>? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JH3WvI_S6-k" target="_blank">This</a> might pop into your head. What about The Go-Go’s?</p>
<p>Perhaps you can think of a song, in which case: good work! Gold star. But over and over again I’ve found that people know nothing about them, even though they were one of the most successful girl groups of all time and &#8211; quite frankly &#8211; better than the other two. (I warned you…)</p>
<p>Here are my top reasons why I love The Go-Go’s and you should too:</p>
<h3>1) Perfect pop</h3>
<p>Just listen. My favourite is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQyazt4RDTM&amp;ob=av2n"><strong>Head Over Heels</strong></a> (I like to think of it as the voice of the girl in Devo’s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJdCpNkya3s"><strong>Out of Sync</strong></a>) but other hits include <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3kQlzOi27M&amp;ob=av2n"><strong>Our Lips Are Sealed</strong></a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD1BWcf8vhE"><strong>We Got The Beat</strong></a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9HNKbjxstk"><strong>Vacation</strong></a>. Stupendously catchy choruses, simple lyrics, they’re like a revved-up 60s girl group. I guarantee you, one of these tracks will be stuck in your head all day.</p>
<p>Sorry for the terrible sound quality by the way – I thought you’d like to see the videos. There’s another great video for <strong>Vacation</strong> but the sound was too awful so you’ve got the karaoke version instead.</p>
<h3>2) They played their own instruments <em>and</em> wrote their own songs</h3>
<p>I’m not dissing The Bangles or Banarama, I love them too. I’m just saying they’re The Monkees to the The Go-Go’s Beatles.</p>
<h3>3) For all your 1980s style needs</h3>
<p>Think The Bangles or Bananarama have the last word on 80s fashion? Think again: The Go–Go’s may not have had as much hair but they did have <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Go-Go%27s/+images/5630344" target="_blank">VOLUME</a>.</p>
<p>At one point they even looked a bit <a href="http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/500/10448065/The+GoGos+gogos.jpg" target="_blank">moody &#8216;n&#8217; punk</a>. Check out the braces! (Early on they toured with Madness&#8230;)</p>
<p>And guitarist Jane Wiedlin has sported some amazing looks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anticipating the 1990s with <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Go-Go%27s/+images/24826451" target="_blank">fairy dress and pixie crop</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Go-Go%27s/+images/25066867">Dungarees!</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Go-Go%27s/+images/3838552">Top hat!</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Go-Go%27s/+images/24826501">&#8230;Russian folk chic?</a> She has cool red tights, anyway.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4) Retro ironic album and single covers</h3>

<h3>5) Kicked ass in the charts</h3>
<p>As someone with a lot invested in her &#8216;alternative&#8217; identity (and a diehard contrarian) this doesn’t matter much to me. What I find surprising is that they aren’t better known given their <a href="http://www.billboard.com/artist/the-go-go-s/64572#/artist/the-go-go-s/chart-history/64572">chart success</a>. They had a number one album and four Top 20 singles in the US. I read somewhere that they were the first all female group &#8211; who wrote their own songs and played their own instruments &#8211; to reach number one in the Billboard chart.</p>
<h3>6) Better pop patron</h3>
