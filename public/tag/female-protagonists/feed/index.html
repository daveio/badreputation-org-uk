					<description><![CDATA[When I first burst onto the pages of BadRep, no sooner had I criticised Mass Effect's trailers when FemShep arrived. So I thought it'd only be right to address the marketing of ME3 before I tell you all about the game itself.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As is no secret, the final instalment in the <strong>Mass Effect</strong> trilogy was released on 9th March after months of buildup and anticipation.  People weren&#8217;t just excited to see what would happen &#8211; <strong>Bioware</strong> &amp;<strong> EA</strong> also caused a bit of a stir with their marketing this time around.  Here I&#8217;m going to look at trailers and the game&#8217;s packaging to see whether the good-fuss about their efforts to make a more gender-balanced campaign is well-deserved.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fem-bro-shep.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="10420" data-permalink="/2012/03/26/gamer-diary-mass-effect-3-presenting-a-fairer-image/fem-bro-shep/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fem-bro-shep.jpg?fit=450%2C206&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="450,206" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="FemShep and BroShep" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fem-bro-shep.jpg?fit=300%2C137&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fem-bro-shep.jpg?fit=450%2C206&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10420" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fem-bro-shep.jpg?resize=450%2C206" alt="Meet the Shepards" width="450" height="206" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fem-bro-shep.jpg?w=450&amp;ssl=1 450w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fem-bro-shep.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Trailers</span></h3>
<p>You may remember that when I first burst onto the pages of BadRep I was talking about <a title="[Gamer Diary] RPG Advertising: Where Did All The Women Go?" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/05/16/gamer-diary-rpg-advertising-women/" target="_blank">RPG advertising</a> and the distinct lack of women in these trailers, despite the games&#8217; built-in capability for you to play as a female protagonist.  I mentioned <strong>Mass Effect</strong> advertisements, and no sooner had I criticised them than they announced they&#8217;d make a &#8216;FemShep&#8217; trailer and let the fans vote on what she&#8217;d look like.  So I thought it&#8217;d only be right to address the marketing of <strong>ME3</strong> before I tell you all about the game <em>itself.</em></p>
<p>The<a title="Mass Effect 3 Debut Trailer" href="http://youtu.be/BnEej1RfqTs" target="_blank"> first glimpses</a> we saw of <strong>Mass Effect 3</strong> didn&#8217;t show a female Shepard; actually, they barely showed a male Shepard either (but he was still there) &#8211; we were simply teased with the knowledge that the war was coming to Earth.  Notably, the voiceover doesn&#8217;t say &#8220;if <em>he</em> doesn&#8217;t bring help&#8221; but just says &#8220;Shepard&#8221; to avoid any issue of gender.  But <em>then you see male Shepard&#8230; so, er, kinda redundant there.</em></p>
<p>When they first showed everyone <a title="Mass Effect 3 FemShep Reinstated" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pShKKOV_gA" target="_blank">FemShep</a>, to me, the trailer didn&#8217;t have the same production quality that it could have had, but they made this up with later offerings, such as those below.</p>
<p>Next we have the Take Earth Back pair of trailers; <a title="Mass Effect 3 Take Earth Back (male)" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzKbIE7IM2o" target="_blank">one male</a> and <a title="Mass Effect 3 Take Earth Back Femshep" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVz3roXf-Kc" target="_blank">one female</a>.  These two did good.  They&#8217;re the same, just with a different version of Shepard in each.  There&#8217;s no making one look cooler, or more badass, than the other, and that&#8217;s <strong>great</strong>.  The pity is, though, that TV channels didn&#8217;t really seem to pick up FemShep&#8217;s version &#8211; I only ever saw the male version being broadcast.</p>
<p>Then we get to launch day and they start pushing the <a title="Mass Effect 3 Launch Trailer" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AluTOOCVXVQ" target="_blank">&#8216;Launch Trailer&#8217;</a>, and as far as I can discover, there&#8217;s only one version: Male Shepard (or BroShep)&#8217;s version.  This might not be too bad; there&#8217;s a lot of female characters shown &#8211; Ashley, Liara, Jack, Miranda etc &#8211; and that&#8217;s more than a lot of games can say at the moment.  The thing that ruins it, though, is the <em>(totally unnecessary)</em> sex snapshot of Shepard bedding Ashley, who is the woman fighting beside you in the T.E.B. trailers I linked above.</p>
<p>Of course, it could be argued that having <em>that</em> in the trailer shows how you can romance your team-mates if you so desire and that it&#8217;s an all-inclusive RPG experience.  But it really isn&#8217;t necessary and is completely discordant with the rest of the trailer.</p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Packaging</span></h3>
<p>Here I can only talk about my box when it arrived, so there may have been people receiving differently presented games.  When my game arrived the sleeve insert (that paper thing that slips under the plastic on the box) was displaying a proud BroShep on the front and back.  I was a bit disappointed as I&#8217;ve never really thought much about Template BroShep&#8217;s appearance as part of my gaming experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/FS-Cover.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="10422" data-permalink="/2012/03/26/gamer-diary-mass-effect-3-presenting-a-fairer-image/fs-cover/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/FS-Cover.jpg?fit=641%2C427&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="641,427" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;4.5&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS 1100D&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1332355575&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;35&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;2500&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.02&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="FemShep Mass Effect 3 Packaging" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/FS-Cover.jpg?fit=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/FS-Cover.jpg?fit=641%2C427&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-10422" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/FS-Cover-300x199.jpg?resize=300%2C199" alt="" width="300" height="199" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/FS-Cover.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/FS-Cover.jpg?w=450&amp;ssl=1 450w, https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/FS-Cover.jpg?w=641&amp;ssl=1 641w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t until I had to insert Disc 2 while loading the game that I discovered FemShep hiding underneath the disc!  The cover is reversible, so you can have FemShep on the front and on the back (though the screenshot inserts are still BroShep) if you take the insert out and flip it around.  Obviously, I did this immediately so I didn&#8217;t have to look at <em>his</em> smug face anymore. The reversibility is great, but you have to realise it&#8217;s available and then you have to do it yourself.</p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline">Have they done well, then?</span></h3>
<p>I think they have, but there&#8217;s a bit of improving yet to do &#8211; not for <strong>Mass Effect</strong>, as the trilogy is now complete, but for other titles following in its footsteps.</p>
<p>The male interpretation of an either/or, binary choice, RPG protagonist is still the default in marketing, it seems.  There may well be more male gamers buying these titles, but that doesn&#8217;t mean they wouldn&#8217;t want to see all a game can offer.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really very pleased that the marketing strategy has improved &#8211; at least for this game &#8211; and I&#8217;m hoping it&#8217;ll continue to do so for other releases this year and in the future.  It is a real treat to see FemShep kicking some bottoms in that Take Earth Back trailer, and I hope we&#8217;ll see lots more awesome female protagonists to come.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>As a side note: for those of you waiting to see a review, it&#8217;s coming &#8211; I&#8217;m just being extra thorough.  And yes, I will talk about <em>that ending</em> and the ensuing furore.</p>

<p>Pixar&#8217;s first full length movie with a female protagonist is less than four months away from release. And, <a href="http://io9.com/5887598/watch-the-first-scene-from-pixars-brave-now">as io9 reported last week</a>, the first scene is now previewable:</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/JOmc2GzWtSE" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>I&#8217;m really excited. ENGAGE INITIAL BURBLE-O-METER:</p>
<h3>HURRAH!</h3>
<ul>
<li>I remain so, so pleased to see a Pixar movie from the point of view of a girl character. Without exception, the entire Pixar canon &#8211; which I&#8217;m a huge, boxset-toting, scene-quoting fan of, for the record &#8211; features male protagonists, and while <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessie_(Toy_Story)">Jessie</a>, <a href="http://pixar.wikia.com/Dory">Dory</a>, and <a href="http://pixar.wikia.com/Ellie_Fredricksen">Ellie</a> (who determines much of <strong>Up</strong>&#8216;s story even though it&#8217;s via her absence) are all fun and compelling sidekick or partner characters, I&#8217;ve been waiting for Pixar to place a female character centre-stage. And now, after over 20 years, we&#8217;ve got one in the shape of Princess Merida, headstrong Scottish medieval archery whizz. </li>
<li>Placing a female character centre-stage, of course, is not the be-all and end-all. Disney&#8217;s been doing it for years with their fairytale movies and resultant &#8220;princess&#8221; brand. They&#8217;ve finally brought the curtain down on their run of &#8220;princess&#8221; films with 2010&#8217;s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0398286/"><strong>Tangled</strong></a>, which I thought was charmingly smart, sassy and very happy, to a point, to send up its own canon. But it still operated very much within the constraints of that canon &#8211; it was, in places, a bit like <strong>Legally Blonde</strong> in Fairytale Land &#8211; and I&#8217;m hoping this will bust the box open juuuust a bit more.</li>
<h3>BROW-FURROW!</h3>
<li>I think it&#8217;s interesting that Pixar have chosen, as far as I can tell, to make their first girl-POV movie begin from a starting problem of an arranged marriage tradition, and the synopsis as it stands (it&#8217;s on the io9 page) hints that they&#8217;re going with Little Mermaid-style tropes of &#8220;headstrong young woman consults wise woman for advice to avoid patriarchal problem; things go wrong&#8221;, and so on. Being critical for just a moment, I do think it would be good in the end to get to a Disney/Pixar film where female characters are not lone figures in a world of predominantly male characters, or on quests where the aim is to fight the male status quo. Or as one commenter on io9 put it, &#8220;I&#8217;m still waiting for the movie about the girl who doesn&#8217;t have to prove she&#8217;s awesome or that she&#8217;s as good as boys&#8221;. It makes me want to cheer and bounce off my chair when Merida fires that final arrow in front of all those shocked dudes, but I&#8217;d also quite like to just see her &#8230; go on a quest that isn&#8217;t about Defying Sexism. Lone Female Crusaders are all over our screens with relative frequency, from <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/03/23/at-the-movies-true-grit/"><strong>True Grit</strong>&#8216;s Mattie Ross</a> &#8211; who has a lump-throat-making scene where she packs her bags for adventure and stuffs rolls of newspaper in a man&#8217;s cowboy hat to make it fit her head &#8211; to <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/01/18/at-the-movies-the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo-oh-god-i-am-so-sorry-i-watched-the-remake-first/"><strong>The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo</strong>&#8216;s Lisbeth Salander</a> (arguably the ultimate Lone Woman On A Vengeful Spree for our time), and I&#8217;d like to see more scope for women in Hollywood stories to get to interact a bit more with <em>other women</em> &#8211; beyond, for example, &#8220;but mother, WHY can&#8217;t I do X&#8221; and &#8220;yes, sorceress, I will make this dodgy deal with you!&#8221; at the very least.</li>
<h3>BACK TO HURRAH-ING!</h3>
<li>Buuuut the fact remains that this scene still makes me go misty eyed and wibbly at the slightest provocation. I love how it looks and feels, and it&#8217;s got Billy Connolly (playing Princess Merida&#8217;s warlord dad, with whom she seems to have a pleasingly co-conspirator relationship rather than what I call the King Triton Model, though this does mean relations with mum aren&#8217;t looking cosy), Emma Thompson, Julie Walters (the wise woman conflict catalyst!) and more on board. It&#8217;s been co-authored by two women (for anyone casually interested in the gender balance of the creative team) and I&#8217;m honestly so excited (IT HAS A BEAR IN IT I LOVE BEARS I HOPE SHE DOES NOT SHOOT THE BEAR) that I&#8217;m really glad it won&#8217;t be long now.</li>
<li>ENTIRELY SPECULATION, BUT ANYWAY: On the fairy tale riffing front, I&#8217;m pleased to see such an obvious Robin Hood folklore moment referenced in the scene above &#8211; he, of course, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_v1OaC4jv1c#t=4m59s">splits an arrow just like this</a> in his own quest to win Maid Marion, and in this version the princess is out to win&#8230;her own hand. Neat. Since it was originally titled <em>The Bear and the Bow</em>, so presumably has a bear of some importance in the story, it&#8217;s also got me wondering whether it&#8217;ll draw on beast stories like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_of_the_Sun_and_West_of_the_Moon">East of the Sun, West of the Moon</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brown_Bear_of_Norway">Brown Bear of Norway</a>. The idea is that the woman goes on a journey and finds a man/foils a curse along the way. That might not happen in <strong>Brave</strong> at all, but since the opening problem is marriage-related I&#8217;d be surprised if no options around the topic came up, and if it doesn&#8217;t happen like that, that&#8217;ll be an attempt at subversion in itself. Either way, I think with the final title being <strong>Brave</strong> I&#8217;m optimistic about how it&#8217;ll turn out for Merida.</li>
<li>THERE IS A HORSE IN IT AND HIS NAME IS ANGUS. I love Disney&#8217;s horses. They&#8217;ve carved out a noble niche as providers of bathos and irony over the years from <a href="http://disney.wikia.com/wiki/Samson_(Sleeping_Beauty)">Samson</a> through to <a href="http://disney.wikia.com/wiki/Maximus">Maximus</a>. ANGUS, I HAVE HIGH HOPES FOR YOU. (Although I kind of wish you were an <a href="http://maxbarry.com/2011/07/08/news.html">Elspeth</a>, maybe? I mean, Maximus would&#8217;ve been fine as&#8230; Agrippina, you know?) Oh God, now everyone&#8217;s going to think I&#8217;m really weird. Uh. Moving on.</li>
<li>Conclusion: Any road, I think my DVD shelf can take one more Lone Female Crusader in this instance. See you in the cinema.</li>
