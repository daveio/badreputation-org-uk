					<description><![CDATA[Come on Tesco, men can like knitting and women can read Private Eye...]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Lizzie</strong> sent us the following update to <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/07/30/guest-post-magazine-rack-sexism-or-women-read-private-eye-too">her recent previous guest post</a> this morning. If you have a guest post brewing in your brain, you know what to do: pitch us at <a href="mailto:badrepeditors@gmail.com?Subject=Pitch">badrepeditors@gmail.com</a>.</em></p>
<p>About a month ago I emailed both Sainsburys and Tesco, following it up with tweets, about the gendering of magazines. It seemed wrong that <strong>New Scientist</strong>, <strong>Photography</strong>, <strong>NME</strong>, <strong>The Economist</strong> and <strong>Private Eye</strong> sat in &#8216;Men&#8217;s Interests&#8217; sections while women had the 3,738 fashion and beauty mags as well as knitting and cooking mags.</p>
<p>Tesco were the first to respond, telling me via tweet that they were passing this up to central management:</p>

<p>It took a while for anything else to happen, but a week later <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/07/30/guest-post-magazine-rack-sexism-or-women-read-private-eye-too/">I got an email from Sainsburys</a> saying that where they were refurbishing or creating a new store, they would cease to gender their magazines.</p>
<p>Fabulous. I mean, I would prefer it if they spent the small amount of money printing new labels for the plastic holders on their magazine racks and replaced them all NOW, but that&#8217;s because they have a lot of stores, and seeing this every day still makes my head hurt and fear for young girls who go in and subconsciously learn that science and politics are not for them and that they should concentrate on being pretty while cooking.<sup><a href="/2012/08/09/guest-post-further-adventures-with-magazine-rack-sexism/#footnote_0_11852" id="identifier_0_11852" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" Ed&rsquo;s tiny note: Or indeed the boys who learn to compartmentalise &ldquo;knitting&rdquo;, for example, as &ldquo;for girls&rdquo; &ndash; certainly some proud male knitters have commented on this site in the past! ">1</a></sup></p>
<p>But Tesco still haven&#8217;t replied properly. Nothing more except another tweet to BadRep saying management are looking at it. And now, the <a href="http://www.everydaysexism.com/">Everyday Sexism Project</a> (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/everydaysexism">@EverydaySexism</a> on Twitter, and you can also check out the hashtag #everydaysexism) is really helping out &#8211; drawing attention to the gendered labels in a local store and retweeting those pressuring <a href="http://www.twitter.com/uktesco">@UKTesco</a> to take some form of action.</p>
<p>What would be even better would be for more of us to email them. And while you&#8217;re at it, email Sainsburys too and ask them to put their hand in their pocket to start making the changes now, so we don&#8217;t have to look at this sexism everyday. It&#8217;s just not good enough.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Why are so many magazines still stocked as "men's interest"? ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Our mate Lizzie &#8211; she of the <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/tag/lizzies-feminist-wedding-quest/">wedding adventures</a> &#8211; sent us this post a few weeks ago. She&#8217;s been taking supermarkets to task, because in 2012 we really shouldn&#8217;t be seeing political mags (or<strong> Total Film</strong>, or <strong>Kerrang!</strong>) on a shelf marked <em>MEN&#8217;S INTEREST</em>. She&#8217;s not alone in her view, either &#8211; lately feminists around the UK have been making the point, with a particular upsurge recently (perhaps in the wake of other successful retail-themed mini campaigns, like Londonfeminist&#8217;s <a href="http://londonfeminist.com/site/dear-new-look/">calling out the World Cup sexist t-shirts on sale in New Look</a>, or WH Smith&#8217;s <a href="http://www.thisiskent.co.uk/Women-win-battle-WHSmith-sexism-row/story-13297949-detail/story.html">decision in 2011</a> to stop categorising certain books as &#8220;women&#8217;s fiction&#8221;). About three weeks before we were originally going to post this, <a href="http://vagendamag.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/tesco-retro.html">the Vagenda drew attention to the Magazine Rack Sexism Problem</a>, and across the pond <a href="http://notanaughtyword.blogspot.co.uk/2011/10/weaponry-or-weddings-sexism-in.html">things don&#8217;t seem much different either</a>. </p>
<p>A few days after we received the post, one chain emailed Lizzie back. We&#8217;ve added the email into the post so you can see CUSTOMER SERVICE IN ACTION.</p>

<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>Dear Tesco and Sainsburys,</p>
<p>Can you please cease categorising <strong>The Economist</strong>, <strong>New Scientist</strong>, <strong>Private Eye</strong>, and the <strong>Spectator</strong> as &#8216;Men&#8217;s Interest&#8217; magazines? I think you’ll find all genders are interested in politics and business. You are perpetuating the myth that women only care about (because they are valued for) their beauty.</p>
<p>While I accept (but hate) that a large proportion of women read <strong>Cosmo</strong> and <strong>Marie Claire</strong> and <strong>Good Housekeeping</strong>, I think that a large proportion also watch the news, vote, work, and may be interested in reading <strong>The Economist </strong>from time to time. You don’t segregate papers (although papers themselves, with their Femail sections, and Style sections, also start pushing my buttons). Why the shit have you determined that certain topics are not for the eyes of women?</p>
<p>Women still suffer unequal pay way before they think about maternity leave, and this is part of the same problem &#8211; you are saying that business and politics (something we are all involved in, one way or another) is purely the domain of men.</p>
<p>Sort this out immediately, please. It&#8217;s patronising and misogynistic. Actually, can you please also remove film, photography, game, cars, nature and music mags from the same category while you are at it, as that&#8217;s also inaccurate as well? Unless you think women <em>can&#8217;t</em> like music, cars, photography, video games, nature and film? I mean, it’s not as if you really think only men are interested in those topics, right? You have to admit that, say, there have been some female musicians, and some women actually enjoy going to the cinema and hey, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Arbus">Diane Arbus</a> existed, and gosh, there are female commuters on the roads.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d stick with just <strong>Men&#8217;s Health</strong> if I were you, and even that’s shaky.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Women in the UK</p>
<h3>What to do?</h3>
<p>To complain to Tesco, please <a href="https://www.tescohelp.com/tesco/forms/cs_form.html">go here</a>. For Sainsburys, <a href="http://www.sainsburys.co.uk/sol/contact_us/contact_us.jsp">here</a>. If we get enough people complaining, maybe they’ll actually listen and change their stores. I mean, if a little girl <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-16812545">can get the name of a loaf of bread changed at Sainsbury’s</a>, surely they&#8217;re amenable to listening to vindicated complaints by women who are tired of being told to not use our brains and instead just look pretty. I mean, bread name change by photogenic small child must have meant something rather than being innocuous PR in a time of recession, right?</p>
<h3>Boom! Progress from Sainsburys!</h3>
<blockquote><p><strong>From: Sainsburys<br />
To: Lizzie</strong></p>
<p>Dear Lizzie</p>
<p>Thank you for your email and suggestion that we reconsider the signage used to categorise magazines in our stores.  I understand you feel our current method is dated and we certainly do not want to imply the magazines are gender specific.</p>
<p>Up until now we have used information from publishers, who identify the target demographic for their magazines.  We have organised the magazines on our shelves accordingly.  We appreciate the points you have made, and have undertaken a review of the signage we use in store.</p>
<p>I am pleased to say that going forward, our magazines will be shown by genre and they will not have a gender prefix.  There will not be an immediate change to the magazine sections in all our stores as this will be a gradual roll out replacing the existing signage.  This should also address the grammar issues that you kindly brought to our attention. </p>
<p>We appreciate you taking the time to contact us, giving us the opportunity to look into your concerns.  We look forward to seeing you in store again soon.</p></blockquote>
<p>So that just leaves Tesco, from whom, as we go to press, Lizzie is still waiting to hear. Bad form, guys. (Although what Sainsburys mean by &#8220;grammar issues&#8221; is eluding us slightly here at BR Towers. This is a SEXISM ISSUE.)</p>
<p>Time to get on it, readers! To the Tesco feedback page, one and all. </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Thanks to Lizzie for making a noise and sending us her progress. Have you had a Customer Service Breakthrough or Problem lately? Get in touch and tell us all about it!</em></li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>Philip Roth is a good writer, but I wouldn&#8217;t want to shake hands with him.<br />
&#8211; Jacqueline Susann, after reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portnoy%27s_Complaint"><strong>Portnoy&#8217;s Complaint</strong></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Last week was a busy week in the book world. Sainsburys found itself anointed Bookseller of the Year to the <a href="http://www.thebookseller.com/blogs/sainsbury%E2%80%99s-defence.html"><em>chagrin</em> </a>of actual booksellers, the beleaguered Waterstones chain was <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/waterstones-looks-to-a-local-future-2287223.html">saved </a> from the asset-stripping abyss, and the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-13452728">Man Booker International Prize</a> went to the veteran novelist <strong>Philip Roth</strong>. The last of these events made the biggest splash in the mainstream press, due to the consequent resignation in protest from the judging panel of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmen_Callil">Carmen Callil</a>, the redoubtable founder of <a href="http://www.virago.co.uk/"><strong>Virago Press</strong></a>, who – cue shock, horror, and the frantic ordering by booksellers of Roth’s backlist – disparaged Roth as a writer and disputed his worthiness to win.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Roth digs brilliantly into himself, but little else is there. His self-involvement and self-regard restrict him as a novelist. And so he uses a big canvas to do small things, and yet his small things take up oceanic room. The more I read, the more tedious I found his work, the more I heard the swish of emperor&#8217;s clothes.&#8221;<br />

Although Callil was quick to quash any <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/may/21/philip-roth-protest-feminism-virago">conjecture </a>that her decision to dish Roth was influenced by feminist considerations, emphasising rather her concerns over awarding the prize to yet another North American novelist, this didn’t prevent the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booker-prize/8521557/Feminist-judge-resigns-after-Philip-Roth-wins-Man-Booker-International-Prize.html"><strong>Telegraph </strong></a>reporting the affair under the headline &#8216;Feminist Judge Resigns&#8230;&#8217;, nor the majority of reports stressing her feminist credentials &#8211; or taint, perhaps &#8211; as head of Virago. Although Callil argues that her objections to Roth transcend his portrayal of women, much of the subsequent debate centred on the misogynist-or-not nature of Roth’s writing. Several female authors appear for the prosecution towards the end of <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/is-philip-roth-a-truly-great-american-novelist-2286644.html">this </a>piece, while <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2001/jun/30/fiction.philiproth">Linda Grant</a> and <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/karen-stabiner/the-philip-roth-reader-wh_b_404498.html">Karen Stabiner</a> have previously argued for a more nuanced perspective.</p>
<p>What interested me about the whole farrago, apart from the unbecoming glee with which several respondents leapt upon Callil’s admittedly oddly graphic description of her reaction to Roth’s writing (&#8216;<em>[He] goes on and on and on about the same subject in almost every single book. It’s as though he’s sitting on your face and you can&#8217;t breathe.</em>&#8216;), was how quickly comments to many of the pieces above dived into questions of whether Roth, with his &#8216;priapic&#8217; preoccupations and thematic concentration on the ups and downs of male sexuality, was just too &#8216;male&#8217; a writer for Callil’s tastes and, by extension, for those of female readers as a whole. Robert McCrum in the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/booksblog/2011/may/18/philip-roth-booker-prize"><strong>Observer </strong></a>wrote of Callil:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Her expertise is as an ebullient and pioneering feminist publisher from the 1970s. It&#8217;s hardly a surprise that she should find herself unresponsive to Roth&#8217;s lifelong subject: the adventures of the ordinary sexual (American) man.</p>

<p>Female readers, and especially those with feminist sensibilities, so the argument seems to run, cannot be expected to appreciate or enjoy writing by men which concentrates on the male experience. Any criticisms they might raise of such writing, based on personal evaluations of its quality, technique, or aesthetic appeal, rather than its content, can therefore be instantly dismissed because, well, you were never going to like it anyway, were you. It’s not <em>for</em> you. Apart from anything else, this assertion is unsound: the articles above and elsewhere illustrate that many women do enjoy and appreciate writing by Roth and his contentious ilk &#8211; Updike, Amis, Easton Ellis &#8211; and it is no less the case that many male readers <a href="http://www.badgerinternet.com/~bobkat/observer1.html">really </a> <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/8527530/For-all-his-dazzling-genius-Philip-Roth-still-leaves-me-cold.html">don’t</a>. Like the comparable <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/01/25/women-men-and-music-the-xy-factor-part-1">myths </a>about male and female approaches to music and music writing, the suggestion that writers, and readers, can be neatly divided on the basis of gender, and their responses to art explained away accordingly, is as bizarre and unhelpful as it is frustratingly persistent.</p>
