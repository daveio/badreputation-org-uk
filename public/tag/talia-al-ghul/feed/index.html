					<description><![CDATA[Now you can play as Catwoman too!  However, she appears to have fallen foul of Rule 1 of Sensible Female Armour.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As is my tendency, this is <a title="[Gamer Diary] RPG Advertising: Where Did All The Women Go?" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/05/16/gamer-diary-rpg-advertising-women/">another party I was late to</a>.  I only got <strong>Arkham Asylum</strong> in late October last year as a gift in a <a title="Steam" href="http://store.steampowered.com" target="_blank">Steam</a> sale – it was only a fiver – and I had previously been rather sceptical about it.  Nevertheless, I played through it and found it very refreshing as a game – very noir, good combat, puzzles to solve and places to explore – and the storyline was interesting, as was the inclusion of so many Batman baddies.  Basically, in short, I loved it.</p>
<p>Mostly.</p>
<p><a title="Batman Wiki: Harley Quinn" href="http://batman.wikia.com/wiki/Harley_Quinn_(Batman:_Arkham_Asylum)" target="_blank">Harley Quinn</a> and <a title="Batman Wiki: Poison Ivy" href="http://batman.wikia.com/wiki/Poison_Ivy_(Batman:_Arkham_Asylum)" target="_blank">Poison Ivy</a> were the issues.  I don’t want to sound like a broken record but boobs on display in a high risk profession such as being a Gotham City criminal is not exactly clever – is it?  Harley was very nice to see as a significant part of the story that is out to scupper your plans, but her being called some less-than-charming things by the Joker’s own thugs was tedious to say the least, and when you actually fight Harley <em>herself</em> she is defeated ridiculously easily &#8211; in a cutscene no less.  Disappointing.</p>

It&#8217;d be terribly inconvenient and I might have to reconsider my outfit!&#8221;</p></div>
<p>Ivy, when you first meet her, is lounging about in her cell – apparently the only female inmate – not wearing prison issues but her own clothes displaying her sizeable bust.  Later, in her boss fight, for some reason she decides to float about attacking you in what &#8211; as our ed described to me in an email &#8211; “appears to be a giant laughing vulva-plant which flaps open periodically to reveal she still isn&#8217;t wearing a great deal…”.  <strong>Super</strong>.</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure she gets referred to as some less-than-charming things too by hench<strong>men</strong>.</p>
<p>Fast forward to <strong>Arkham City</strong>, which I got in another sale (but it still cost me £20), and now you can play as <a title="Batman Wiki: Catwoman" href="http://batman.wikia.com/wiki/Catwoman_(Batman:_Arkham_City)">Catwoman</a> too!  <em>However,</em> she appears to have fallen foul of <a title="[Gamer Diary] – Dystopian Beauties: How the Apocalypse Killed all the Trolls" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/11/23/gamer-diary-dystopian-beauties-how-the-apocalypse-killed-all-the-trolls/" target="_blank">Rule 1 of Sensible Female Armour</a>: her suit is only ever zipped up to just below her breasts, allowing for ample cleavage.  When you fight thugs as Catwoman, you get called a ‘bitch’ but for some reason, if you’re Batman, you don’t get called a prick, a wanker, a bastard or even a knobend.  <em>Really</em>, people?</p>
<p>The assassins of Rā&#8217;s al Ghūl’s order are all for some reason scantily clad sex icons – as is his <a title="Batman Wiki: Talia al Ghul" href="http://batman.wikia.com/wiki/Talia_al_Ghul_(Batman:_Arkham_City)" target="_blank">daughter</a> – and the <a title="DeviantART: Arkham City Assassin Concept Art" href="http://makiog.deviantart.com/art/Arkham-City-Assasin-Concept-Art-277619351" target="_blank">concept art</a> is mainly essentially the sort of softcore you might find in lads’ mags.  In fact the vast majority of the concept art involving any female character is pretty oversexualised and repugnant.  We get to meet Ivy again, too, but it seems she still hasn’t bothered to find any clothes since the laughing vulva-plant incident.  And Harley is wearing even more revealing kit than last time.</p>
<div id="attachment_11654" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/harley.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11654" data-attachment-id="11654" data-permalink="/2012/01/30/gamer-diary-batman-arkham-asylum-arkham-city-or-the-bat-and-his-bitches/harley/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/harley.jpg?fit=570%2C299&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="570,299" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="harley" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/harley.jpg?fit=300%2C157&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/harley.jpg?fit=570%2C299&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-11654" title="harley" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/harley-300x157.jpg?resize=300%2C157" alt="Harley Quinn, in a low-cut leather bustier with blonde pigtails, gestures at Batman" width="300" height="157" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/harley.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/harley.jpg?w=570&amp;ssl=1 570w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-11654" class="wp-caption-text">Great graphics, but do we really need to see that much breast?</p></div>
<p>Now, even if we leave aside all of this sexist nonsense, <strong>Arkham City</strong> is somewhat disappointing anyway.  I finished the storyline in less than a day; the ending snuck up on me and was rubbish.  I won’t say what happens, but&#8230; just&#8230; what?!  That’s even before I get to the complaint I have with the <em>huge</em> continuity hole left at the end.  I was so disheartened by it that I did a Ragequit of Disappoints and haven’t gone back on it since.  Even though I still have lots of side quests and puzzles to solve, I just haven’t found the heart to go back to it.</p>
<p><strong>Arkham Asylum</strong> was worth the £5 but <strong>City</strong> was definitely not worth the £20 – let alone the standard retail price in the range of up to £39.99!  The first game offered something new and interesting with a gorgeous noir feel much akin to Nolan’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_in_film#Christopher_Nolan_trilogy">reimagining</a> of Gotham on film, if not grittier.  The second game whizzed past all too quickly, with no real indication that one should slow down, do side quests, do the puzzles and so on, lest you face the atrocious storyline ending.</p>
<p>Benefits of the second game, however, do exist; the world is larger, you get more gadgets and there are no area transitions between outdoor locations.  Plus you <em>do</em> get to play as Catwoman, even if she is just eye candy to be abused by burly henchmen. <em>(Are there really no female crims in Gotham?)</em></p>
<p>Both games do fall down woefully at the Treating Female Characters with Respect hurdle.  Would it truly be so hard to think logically about the design of these people?  Does Batman walk around without his Kevlar body armour, flexing his pectorals, with a big “SHOOT HERE” target on his chest?  No.  No, he does not.  So why should Catwoman, or Ivy, or Harley?  Basic boob-sense would say maybe a comfy sports bra would be better than leather basques and flimsy shirts with only one button done up.  At least then the breast tissue wouldn’t detach during all this acrobatic criminality.</p>
<p>Also, Catwoman has anti-gravity boobs.</p>
