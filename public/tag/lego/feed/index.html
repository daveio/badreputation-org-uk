<blockquote><p>“It’s all about the joy of creation&#8230;”</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230; is the song that Lego use on their website to showcase their <a href="http://friends.lego.com/en-gb/Default.aspx" target="_blank">Friends series</a>.</p>
<p>Not what you were expecting? Perhaps you thought <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=GB&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;v=DwBirf4BWew" target="_blank"><strong>Stand By Your Man</strong></a> or some other such cringeworthy song might be more appropriate for a series so blatantly gendered. Well, so did I, but one happy little girl at a time, the Friends range has swayed my feelings.</p>
<p>Let me backtrack and give it some history.</p>
<p>The Lego Friends series was released earlier this year.</p>
<p>When the toys (and adverts) were unleashed, the internet seemingly exploded with outrage. (I am,<br />
of course, referring to <em>my</em> internet &#8211; the one with feminist twitter feeds, blogs about toys and sexy pictures of Neil Gaiman. Your internet might be a bit different.)</p>
<p>In particular I watched <a href="http://www.feministfrequency.com/" target="_blank">Feminist Frequency</a>’s <a href="http://www.feministfrequency.com/2012/01/lego-gender-part-1-lego-friends/" target="_blank">videos on</a> <a href="http://www.feministfrequency.com/2012/02/lego-gender-part-2-the-boys-club/" target="_blank">the series</a>, but I also read blogposts from dads who want their girls to work in Silicon Valley and study at MIT.</p>
<p>The first few toys released were a bakery, a café, a beauty shop, a house and an inventor’s<br />
workshop. These initial toys are made up of pastel pink and purple bricks, they only feature girls and<br />
those roles present are mainly gendered home-keeping roles.</p>
<p>My blood was boiling, like many other people&#8217;s, at the narrow roles I could see girls being pushed into. At my local Toys R Us there is a vast collection of Lego from the <a href="http://creator.lego.com/en-gb/Default.aspx" target="_blank">Creator series</a> to <a href="http://www.lego.com/cars/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank">Cars</a>. In fact I have never seen so much in one retailer.</p>
<p>However, the Friends series is not placed in their giant Lego selection. It is in a (very clearly labelled) ‘Girlz’ aisle,nowhere near the Lego corner, which has so much sparkle and glitter I thought cupcakes were<br />
going to spontaneously erupt from the walls.</p>
<p>Friends is not like the rest of Lego: it’s for girls, and must be segregated.</p>
<p>So far, so sexist.</p>
<p>However, I’m slowly putting the guns down. Across the various worlds of Lego, equality is growing. As someone who has an obsessive love of toys, I frequently visit their website. Every time I find<br />
myself riled up about Lego, I go on the site and find that a far greater balance of characters is presented there than we see in the shops.</p>

I was angry about the lack of girl characters in <a href="http://ninjago.lego.com/en-gb/Default.aspx" target="_blank">Spinjitzu</a>. But Nya (pictured right) has a  <a href="http://ninjago.lego.com/en-gb/world/characters/default.aspx" target="_blank">token girl description</a> which does include phrases like &#8220;she’s no damsel in distress&#8221; and &#8220;Nya is fed up with the ninjas’ boy’s club syndrome&#8221;.</p>
<p>Here, the minority female mini figures I have collected become role models. Still a token, but a valuable one at that, and the question remains why we don’t see more of this outside of the website.</p>
<p>I recently decided to explore the <a href="http://friends.lego.com/en-us/Products/Details/3934.aspx" target="_blank">Friends section of the website</a> and was pleasantly surprised and then genuinely excited about what it offers. I believe that Lego listened to t<a href="http://www.change.org/petitions/tell-lego-to-stop-selling-out-girls-liberatelego" target="_blank">he petition from Change.org</a> (the one that got over 50,000 signatures, the one I signed) back in April 2012, and have turned something that was completely sexist into a city of steps toward empowerment.</p>
<p>First of all, they have toned down the overwhelming pink tones of the bricks, and gone for more brown tones, like <a href="http://friends.lego.com/en-us/Products/Details/3185.aspx" target="_blank">the riding camp</a>. There is also a greater range of sets, including a <a href="http://friends.lego.com/en-us/Products/Details/3065.aspx" target="_blank">treehouse</a>, design<br />
studio, bedroom set with a drum kit and the <a href="http://friends.lego.com/en-us/Products/Details/3063.aspx" target="_blank">Heartlake Flying Club</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/flying.png"><img data-attachment-id="12905" data-permalink="/2012/12/11/guest-post-lego-friends-revisited/flying/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/flying.png?fit=575%2C335&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="575,335" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="flying" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/flying.png?fit=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/flying.png?fit=575%2C335&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-12905 aligncenter" title="flying" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/flying.png?resize=575%2C335" alt="Lego Friends flying school image of aeroplane" width="575" height="335" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/flying.png?w=575&amp;ssl=1 575w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/flying.png?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 575px) 100vw, 575px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>This last set was definitely the swing vote for me. It has the least amount of pink; mere touches of it on the plane. Furthermore, the stereotyped role for women in a plane is Air Hostess, and Lego didn’t go there. Stephanie is the pilot of her own seaplane, looking more Amelia Earhart than Pan Am.</p>
<p>The Friends themselves might enjoy traditionally feminine roles, but they also have jobs, varied interests and detailed characters that allow for diverse roleplaying. The key with Lego is that it can be as many things as you can imagine. <a href="http://friends.lego.com/en-us/Products/Details/3936.aspx" target="_blank">Emma’s Design Studio</a>, for instance, has one piece which suggests this is for fashion &#8211; but with the large desk, the ruler and the laptop Emma could just as easily be an architect or an engineer.</p>
<p>We also shouldn&#8217;t fall into the trap of thinking that enjoying balloons or sweets makes you weak. It&#8217;s more that giving girls <em>only</em> that which is sugary-sweet which is the issue. Although Lego still have a long way to go, I think there are at least positive conversations being had at Lego HQ.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.feministfrequency.com/2012/02/lego-gender-part-2-the-boys-club/" target="_blank">her second Lego video</a> Anita Sarkeseesian says that the emphasis with the Lego Friends series is on traditional home-keeping play. She cites the adverts, comparing the Friends advert slogan “Drive to the newly built café” to the “You can build the castle” of another Lego advert featuring some classic father-son bonding.</p>
<p>She draws the reasonable conclusion that boys are offered a more active play experience that encourages them to use maths and motor skills.</p>
<p>However, if we look on the Lego website the section for Friends has the theme song I quoted at the beginning of this post, which accompanies all their videos:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We can do it, we can dream a whole new way<br />
We can do it, you can build with me today<br />
It’s all about the joy of creation”</p></blockquote>
<p>I think this new emphasis on <em>building</em> which is subtly surrounding you the whole time you shop is part of a change that encourages girls to gain all the skills and experiences that Lego has to offer.</p>
<p>They may not have it all, but the newer Lego Friends sets and marketing are a step in the right direction, and with these steps being echoed in other areas of the Lego Universe… watch this space.</p>

<li><em><strong>Ruth Coustick</strong> has yet to understand the concept of &#8216;growing up&#8217;. She spends her hard-earned cash on Playmobil pirates and building Lego versions of Samus, and wants to see the childish books and toys she loves become more diverse and inclusive. She works in digital rights and has a host of other nerdy interests like comics, board games and First World War poetry. She blogs about her life and fashion at <a href="http://www.origamigirlheroics.blogspot.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>Origami Girl</strong></a>.</em></li>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome to the first Friday Linkpost of 2012!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the first Friday Linkpost of 2012!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.jimchines.com/2012/01/striking-a-pose/">Author Jim C Hines tries out some female poses from fantasy fiction cover art</a></strong> &#8211; and discovers that bodies don&#8217;t work like that.</li>
<li>Which doesn&#8217;t surprise anyone, because <strong>Ils</strong> at <strong>Justsayins</strong> is a martial-artist AND contortionist, and <a href="http://justsayins.tumblr.com/post/14957660366/this-needs-to-stop-and-let-me-tell-you-why"><strong>she can&#8217;t do the poses either</strong></a>. (Her reply post is <a href="http://justsayins.tumblr.com/post/15063906958/its-funny">well worth reading too</a>.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some follow-up links to previous items now, as <strong>Lego</strong>&#8216;s disastrous decision to make <A href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/lego-is-for-girls-12142011.html">pastel-themed and differently-sized Lego just for girls</a> has brought out a whole load of customisation from people who want to give them back an adventuring, building, exciting Lego experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>This <a href="http://superpunch.blogspot.com/2012/01/more-fun-with-lego-for-girls.html"><strong>Badass Retro Aviator</strong></a> by <strong>Nathaniel Brill</strong> made us very happy!</li>
<li>And <a href="http://margotmagowan.wordpress.com/2012/01/04/letter-from-14-yr-old-girl-to-lego/" /><strong>AWESOME 14 year-old Ann Garth</strong></a> wrote to Lego to complain.</li>
<li>We also posted before on <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/09/27/found-feminism-my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic/">the Brony phenomenon</a>, where guys of all ages are becoming fans of <strong>My Little Pony &#8211; Friendship is Magic</strong>, and now <strong>Jonny Sims <a href="http://jonnysopiumden.wordpress.com/2011/12/21/bronies/">suspects he&#8217;s cracked exactly why it&#8217;s happening&#8230;</a></strong></li>
<li>And finally, <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fat-Ladies-Spaaaaace-body-positive-coloring/dp/1463786832">Fat Ladies In Spaaaaace!</strong></a> is the title of a children&#8217;s colouring-book, showing &#8220;<em>Eighteen fat sci-fi heroines doing what they do best: trekking across the time and space, blasting off into adventure, and saving the day.</em>&#8220;</li>
</ul>
