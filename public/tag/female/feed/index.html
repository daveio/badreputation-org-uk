<h3>Are you all sitting comfortably?</h3>
<p>&#8216;Well, well,&#8217; I thought, as I cast my eye over the (now somewhat bedraggled) series of scrawled lists of letters for the Alphabet shoved into my pockets, bursting out of purses and sketchbooks and rotating in scarcely less tatty form in my head. For the question was obvious: What am I going to do for F? Because, you see, Z, Y, X, all those, they&#8217;re not actually that hard. They don&#8217;t have that much riding on them. But F &#8230; well, from the various incarnations of the F-word onwards &#8230; a headache.</p>
<p>Because, you see, the word <em>feminism</em><em> </em>just isn&#8217;t that interesting.</p>
<p>Or rather, its interest lies in its power to evoke wide-ranging, frequently violent reactions while remaining semantically straightforward. <em>Feminism</em><em> </em>gets precisely a centimetre of a three-column page in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary. Because it means two very simple and uncontentious things: in rare form, &#8216;the qualities of women&#8217;, and as it is more commonly understood today, &#8216;advocacy of the claims and rights of women&#8217;, first used sometime around 1895. All those extra things, the bad reputation &#8230; those are add-ons, and not linguistically valid ones, either. So I turned my attention away from <em>feminism</em>, and thought that perhaps I would go back to basics. After all, how often do we think about what <em>female</em><em> </em>means?</p>
<h3>Hey ho, let&#8217;s go.</h3>

<p>Well, it derives from the Middle English &#8216;femelle&#8217; via the Latin &#8216;femella&#8217; which is in turn a diminutive of &#8216;femina&#8217; (= &#8216;woman&#8217; &#8211; yes, another diminutive. They keep popping up, don&#8217;t they?) In its most basic incarnation, <em>female</em> simply means &#8216;belonging to the sex which bears offspring&#8217;. This does not <em>have</em> to involve birthing: let me tell you of the seahorses.</p>
<p>Despite his undisputed &#8216;masculine&#8217; role, the male seahorse receives a parcel of eggs from the female. Upon doing this, he sets out on an aqueous pregnancy-journey, bearing his unborn sea-foals in a pouch specially evolved for the purpose. During incubation, the female what knocked him up visits him each day for a brief catch-up (approximately six minutes), during which time they revisit the rituals of their courtship (holding tails, doing a little pre-dawn dance, smoking that bud and chillin&#8217;).</p>
<p>[Here, you must listen to <a href="http://open.spotify.com/track/7epShlu9CPsrBSm9YPBu7n">The Sea Horse by Flanders &amp; Swann</a>. I&#8217;ll wait here.]</p>
<p>Unlike words like <em>woman </em>and <em>lady</em>, <em>female</em> therefore has a very precise biological meaning that underscores its subsequent development: it is unsurprising that the next place it shows up in the dictionary is in botany (1791), where it refers to the parts of the plant that bear fruit, or, in reference to &#8216;a blossom or flower&#8217;, &#8216;having a pistil and no stamens; pistillate; fruit bearing&#8217; (slightly later: 1796). Of course, &#8216;perfect&#8217; plants are &#8216;bisexual&#8217; in that they possess both male and female parts (this latter, the &#8216;gynoecium&#8217;, literally meaning &#8216;woman house&#8217;). GCSE Biology ftw.</p>
<p>Alongside this specific development is an extremely general one: &#8216;consisting of females&#8217;, &#8216;pertaining to women&#8217; (the dictionary quotes Pope on &#8216;the force of female lungs&#8217;), and then &#8216;characteristic of womankind&#8217; in the seventeenth century and &#8216;womanish&#8217; in the eighteenth. It is curious that the usage here should be &#8216;<em>womankind</em>&#8216; rather than &#8216;femality&#8217; (of which more presently), since <em>woman </em>seems pretty clearly human, and therefore arguably more subjective, than a simple reference to the egg-bearing species.</p>
<h3>How low can you go?</h3>
<p>It is exactly this sort of little shift that leads to <em>female</em>&#8216;s seventh meaning, as an epithet of &#8216;various material and immaterial things, denoting simplicity, inferiority, weakness, or the like&#8217; (one wonders with alarm what &#8216;the like&#8217; might be). Here, of course, we have the realms of the &#8216;feminine rhyme&#8217;, which, while often weaker, are nonetheless much harder to pull off (and more effective, when successful) than any number of the old Moon and June. And mechanics also gets a shout out: <em>female </em>is there applied (as of 1669) to &#8216;that part of an instrument or contrivance which receives the corresponding male part&#8217;. (I love the dry non-specifics of &#8216;instrument or contrivance&#8217;.) However, it should come as no surprise to find that <em>female </em>eventually passes into apparently exclusively negative use: &#8216;as a synonym for &#8216;woman&#8217; now only contemptuous&#8217;.</p>
<blockquote><p>They are no ladies. The only word good enough for them is the word of opprobrium &#8211; females.</p>
<p>&#8211; Anonymous (1889)</p>
<p>&#8216;Female&#8217; &#8230; A circular hole or socket having a spiral thread adapted to receive the thread of the male screw.</p>
<p>&#8211; Anonymous (1669)</p></blockquote>
<p>By way of a postscript: some now rare variants on the word. <em>Femality</em> can be both &#8216;female nature&#8217; and &#8216;unmanliness&#8217;; <em>feminality </em>refers to &#8216;a knick-knack such as women like&#8217;, and <em>Feminie </em>is &#8216;Womankind; especially the <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/10/04/an-alphabet-of-femininism-1-a-is-for-amazon/">Amazons</a>&#8216;. We like it when things stay self-referential.</p>
