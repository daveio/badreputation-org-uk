<p>Thanks to <strong>Brave Sir Robin</strong> for sending this in to us.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a heavily advertised <a href="http://www.lambeth.gov.uk/KnowTheDifference/AboutTheCampaign.htm">rape prevention campaign</a> in the London Borough of Lambeth at the moment which has some very laudable aims, including to challenge the victim blaming culture around rape, recently criticised by Baroness Stern CBE in her report (downloadable <a href="http://www.equalities.gov.uk/stern_review.aspx">here</a>).</p>
<p>The adverts are aimed at young men who socialise in Lambeth, especially Brixton and Clapham, which have recently seen very disturbing rises in rape and sexual violence.</p>
<p>So, is it Found Feminism? I&#8217;m going to give it a two thumbs up for yes, for both reversing gender prejudices and trying a different approach to understanding and dealing with attitudes around rape and rape prevention.</p>
<p>The language and style of both the posters and the website offer a more detailed and mature look at the old &#8220;no means  no&#8221; giving very clear examples of what is and isn&#8217;t legal or acceptable. I&#8217;m particularly interested in this poster because it pushes back the responsibility of gaining consent, and hence on committing the crime, away from what the woman is wearing or what she has had to drink.</p>
<p>Instead, it choses to unpick standard excuses for poor social behaviour:</p>
<blockquote><p>Harmless fun is just that &#8211; harmless fun. Wolf whistling, jeering and making sexually provocative comments can be threatening and make a woman feel at best irritated but also scared and vulnerable. This could be seen as criminal behaviour and you could be arrested and charged. Sexual assault is any unwanted sexual activity.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;d be interested to see whether this style of advert has a wider spread than just one particular borough, and what impact it has on the young men who see the posters.</p>
