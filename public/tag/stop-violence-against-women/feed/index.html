										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This linkpost closes week one of our blogfest on <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/tag/revolting-women/">women and protest</a>. We&#8217;re only part way through, though &#8211; there&#8217;s more next week (and if you&#8217;d like to join in, there&#8217;s still time &#8211; drop us an email on <strong>badrepeditors@gmail.com</strong>). </p>
<p>I should take the opportunity to say that we originally applied the &#8220;Revolting Women&#8221; title in a moment of Pythonesque humour at a point when we were thinking more of protests of past centuries. But it seemed disingenuous to only post about firmly historical examples; surely we should also be connecting the dots forward to events of the present. With this in mind, I hope the &#8220;revolting&#8221; tag isn&#8217;t in poor taste here &#8211; irreverence aside, protest can be dangerous, and never arises when there&#8217;s genuinely much to laugh about at the heart of the matter. So the links below are about campaigns and lobbies happening right now, which you can get involved with yourself. </p>

<li><a href="http://www.nowomennopeace.org/">No Women No Peace</a>: a campaign by Gender Action for Peace and Security (GAPS UK).<em>&#8220;Women are a prime target in conflict. Yet when it comes to building peace, women are excluded. Launched at the 10th anniversary of a groundbreaking UN resolution that calls for women&#8217;s inclusion in peacebuilding, our campaign is simple. You can’t build peace leaving half the people out.&#8221;</em></li>
