										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are a few things that I&#8217;ve decided are never going out of fashion: pirates and zombies.  They&#8217;re ubiquitous.  They&#8217;re <em>everywhere</em>.  Everyone&#8217;s party either wants you to come as one or other or a mixture of the two, or wouldn&#8217;t mind if you did.  This is no bad thing: zombies are obviously a reclamation of the middle-class stigmatisation of the working class as a shambling, faceless, flesh-eating horde, and pirates are &#8230;pirates.  Who wouldn&#8217;t want to be a pirate?  There&#8217;s <em>loads</em> of stuff to like about pirates.  The ships, the clothes, the beards and the array of innovative tropical sexually-acquired infections.  Rum, sodomy and the lash. <em>Anyone&#8217;s</em> idea of fun.</p>
<p><strong>***As is usual, dear readers, the BadRep pirate flag reading SPOILER WARNING &#8211; only mild to moderate this time, but still &#8211; is hereby hoisted here! ***</strong></p>
<p>So, Britain&#8217;s most beloved animation house, <strong>Aardman Animations</strong>, the cheerful cohort behind treasured characters <strong>Wallace &amp; Gromit</strong> and my personal comfort-watchers <a href="http://www.aardman.com/features/released-features/chicken-run/"><strong> Chicken Run</strong></a> and <a href="http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/rex_the_runt/"><strong>Rex The Runt</strong></a>, really can&#8217;t go wrong with a film entitled <strong> The Pirates! In An Adventure With Scientists</strong>.  It&#8217;s adapted from <strong>Gideon Defoe&#8217;s</strong> <a href="http://www.gideondefoe.com/page4.htm">series</a> of childrens&#8217; books of the same name and derivations thereof, one of which is called <strong>The Pirates! In An Adventure With Communists</strong>, and if that doesn&#8217;t make you deliriously excited, then I&#8217;m afraid we can&#8217;t be friends.  I haven&#8217;t read them yet, but I&#8217;ve made arrangements to get them into my eager paws as soon as possible because how can I not?  Pirates!  Everyone likes pirates.</p>
<p>It was the poster that drew my eye first.  Witness:</p>

In An Adventure With Scientists. There is a banner at the top showing the title of the film.  The poster design is a sort of cone of people, with the Pirate Captain (a pale-skinned man with a large brown beard) central.  To the left of him, there is a dark-skinned, cunning-looking female pirate with dark hair and a large cutlass.  To his right, also holding his arm, is a pale-skinned femme pirate dressed in pastel colours with a large, ginger beard.  Beneath them, there are assorted other characters, such as Queen VIctoria, looking vicious and making an &quot;Off with his head&quot; gesture with her hands, and a pirate that looks rather like Elvis, only a pirate.  There is also a mermaid, a galleon, a monkey in a suit, a heap of gold and two cannons.  Assorted pirates and Charles Darwin populate the frame of the image, dangling off airships.

<p><em>PIRATES!</em> it says.  And there they are.  There&#8217;s a nice representation of different genders, ages, ethnicities and beards on the poster, and I was all excited for a nice diverse film &#8211; the sort I tend to dream about.</p>
<p>SHAME IT&#8217;S A LIE.</p>
<p>Well, no, I&#8217;m exaggerating &#8211; it&#8217;s not quite a bare-faced man-churned fictivated sin-speech, but it&#8217;s pretty fallacious.  The main character is that chap in the middle there, the Pirate Captain (<strong>Hugh Grant</strong>).  The pirate to the left of him, Cutlass Liz &#8211; voiced by the brilliant <strong>Salma Hayek</strong> &#8211; is an award-winning Pirate Of The Year, full of swash, buckle and plunder-power, and gets <em>literally no screen-time in which she isn&#8217;t a sex object.</em>  Seriously.  She turns up, wiggles, alludes to her piratical prowess and then&#8230; isn&#8217;t seen again!  She has, like, three scenes!  And one of them is in the dreams of the Pirate Captain where she&#8217;s all, &#8220;Ooh Pirate Captain, I am UNDONE&#8221;.</p>
<p>The pirate to the right of said Pirate Captain in the poster goes by the moniker Suspiciously Curvaceous Pirate (they&#8217;re all &#8220;[Adjective] Pirate&#8221;). Voiced by <strong>Ashley Jensen</strong>, she&#8217;s a dragged-up pirate with an amazing false beard and a sweet Scottish chirp &#8211; who also gets very little screen-time or lines, and whose characterisation appears to revolve around the fact that she likes sparkly jewels, pastel colours and fancies the captain a bit.  The humour of her character is almost exclusively that she&#8217;s a cross-dressing woman.  Now, I&#8217;m never okay with boys in drag being sent up purely for being boys in drag, so why would I be okay with it if the character&#8217;s female?</p>
<p>Not great, is it?</p>
<p>That said, it&#8217;s not all bad news for lady characters in this, but from a rather unexpected source: the villain, voiced by the legendary <strong>Imelda Staunton</strong>, Queen Victoria (&#8220;Look at my crest! What does it say?  I HATE PIRATES.&#8221;) is absolutely magnificent.  She&#8217;s perfect.  Stop making that face.  This is the badassest Queen Vic you have <em>ever</em> seen, and I don’t think it’s possible to not fancy her even a little bit after the credits roll.  She has a <em>battle skirt</em> that clanks aside to reveal a) jodphurs and b) TWO KATANAS.  Come <em>on</em>.  How many other films have had Queen Victoria fighting pirates with katanas before getting vanquished by GCSE-classroom science?  FUCKING ZERO.  THIS IS A UNIQUE CINEMATOGRAPHICAL EXPERIENCE.</p>
<p>OVERALL, the above issues aside, it&#8217;s a very funny film &#8211; the school of humour whereby if one joke doesn&#8217;t wash with you, never fear! there&#8217;ll be another one along in a tick &#8211; and it&#8217;s rich with classic Aardman background detail (the pirate ship has a fusebox, for example, and watch the faces of the taxidermy animals in Charles Darwin&#8217;s (<strong>David Tennant</strong>) house during the bathtub chase scene!).  <strong>Martin Freeman&#8217;s</strong> second-in-command pirate actually looks a bit like him, which is neatly appealing, and <strong>Brian Blessed&#8217;s</strong> megaphonic turn as the Pirate King is predictably godlike.  The dodo is gorgeously animated.  I wish there&#8217;d been more scientists doing science-y things, but then I was imagining something dreadful involving shiny gloves, tailored labcoats and experimentation, and there are reasons I haven&#8217;t been allowed to make films for children and <em>that&#8217;s one of them.</em></p>
<p>But I did make a new poster, to give the neglected characters just a bit more attention. I made Cutlass Liz look a bit more badass, too, on account of her being badass and therefore deserving of a badass coat:</p>

The banner at the top reads, &quot;The Pirates! In An Adventure With Baffling Self-Insert Fanart&quot;. In the centre of the poster, there is a dark-skinned woman with a large pirate hat and coat, reaching for the cutlass at her hip, with a grin.  Her coat has large lapels and is orange.  She is wearing thigh-high black leather boots with turned-down cuffs, and red and yellow striped trousers.  Next to her legs is a banner reading, &quot;REALLY HOT BOOTS!&quot; To her left, there is a pale-skinned femme pirate dressed in pastel colours, twirling their moustache and raising an eyebrow.  Their short-sleeved shirt shows off their biceps.  Above them, there is a banner reading, &quot;BETTER REPRESENTATION!&quot; To the right of the central pirate, there is a thin man with scruffy blond hair and glasses - the artist - standing with his mouth wide open in delight, hunched over and staring at the central pirate in what looks like fan worship.  Above his head, there is a banner reading, &quot;WHAT AM I DOING HERE&quot;.  Behind him, there is a small cannon.  It is labelled with a banner reading, &quot;CANNONS!&quot;  Beneath the three figures, there is a large, green sea-serpent coiled into the bottom left (a banner next to it reads, &quot;MONSTERS!&quot;, and a man in a crown with a large beard in the bottom right.  The man has a large quiff and a frilly shirt.  He is giving a thumbs-up and grinning.  Above his head, there is a banner reading, &quot;Oh fine, Brian Blessed&quot;.

THERE. </p>
<h3>YOU SHOULD SEE THIS FILM BECAUSE:</h3>
<ul>
<li> The best Queen Victoria you have literally ever seen</li>
<li>It&#8217;s really painfully funny</li>
<li>Who doesn&#8217;t want to see Brian Blessed being a pirate king, seriously</li>
<li>There&#8217;s Flight Of The Concords on the soundtrack!</li>
<li>Thank god for stop-motion claymation &#8211; surely the finest animation technique ever? THIS HOUSE BELIEVES: YES</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>YOU SHOULD NOT SEE THIS FILM BECAUSE:</h3>
<ul>
<li>It promises a lot in the trailer and poster in terms of ethnic/gender representation and then doesn&#8217;t deliver</li>
<li>I frankly wanted more science</li>
<li>And more Brian Blessed</li>
<li>More of everything that wasn&#8217;t the cis/white/male lead characters, actually, I mean they were great and all but I&#8217;m bored of cis/white/men being the&#8230; we&#8217;ve already had this discussion, internet, leave me be</li>
</ul>
