										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Perhaps one reason we now refer almost exclusively to ‘actors’ is that, for the longest time, the word ‘actress’ was synonymous with ‘prostitute’. Presumably this relates to the Immodesties they are obliged to suffer on stage; as <strong>Shakespeare in Love</strong> taught us all so well, pre-Restoration these were considered so severe that women were not allowed on stage at all.</p>

<p>This exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery looks at the moment immediately after Charles II reversed this rule, and it’s a fun little look at some portraits, caricatures and paraphernalia of women who <em>were</em> allowed on stage, ‘from Nell Gwyn to Sarah Siddons’. It’s focused on portraits, but there are some super little earthenware tiles with different actresses on them in Room 3. There’s also a facsimile of the Yellow Pages-style brothel directory, <strong>Harris’ List of Covent Garden Ladies; or, The Man of Pleasure’s Kalendar</strong>, illustrating the fall from grace of the once ‘Convent and Garden’ of Westminster Abbey – a bit too close to eighteenth-century Theatreland for PR-comfort. Since its <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Harriss-Covent-Garden-Revealing-History/dp/0752435469">reissue by the History Press</a> this book has now achieved some cult status – the guy next to me, looking at it, said to his companion, ‘You know, Gladys: Harris’ List – that’s the one we’ve got in the toilet’.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nell_Gwyn">Nell</a> (c.1651-87) opens this exhibition – a talented comic actress, although she is popularly most recognised for inspiring Charles II’s last words ‘Let not poor Nelly starve’ (she survived him by barely a year, fact fans). There are two portraits of her here, in both of which she’s got her mammaries out. This exhibition would have these as evidence of her ‘skillful manipulation’ rather than ‘brazen hussydom’; the second portrait shows her <a href="http://i.thisislondon.co.uk/i/pix/2011/10/18-nell-gwyn-415.jpg">naked to the waist</a> and looking directly at the viewer with a gaze at once languid and challenging. You might be reminded of Manet’s <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/Manet%2C_Edouard_-_Olympia%2C_1863.jpg"><strong>Olympia</strong></a>, condemned as ‘vulgar’ and ‘immoral’ on its first exhibition at 1863, mainly because the nude is looking directly at the viewer rather than obligingly turning her head away for better ogling comfort. And indeed, such a tension between looking and being looked at probably underscored a lot of the moral uncertainty about the early actresses.</p>
<p>Later on, we get <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Siddons">Sarah Siddons</a> (1755-1831), powerful, tragic <em>grande dame</em>. She appears in Room 3 painted by Thomas Lawrence as public intellectual, tutor to the royal children – and at a vantage point that forces us to look up at her imperious face, rather than to avert our eyes from her naked bosom. This is hung alongside a number of grandiose actress-as-Muse paintings, large as their themes, and also including Muses of Comedy and society amateurs like Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire.</p>
<p>But even in the late eighteenth century ‘actress’ still wasn’t a career you’d want for your wife. Thespiennes like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Ann_Linley">Elizabeth Ann Sheridan</a> (1754-1792) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Farren">Elizabeth Farren</a> (1759-1829) – both exhibited here – gave up their acting careers, on request, upon marriage. While the eighteenth-century gentleman was not renowned for being into female careers in general, the issue here seems to be more ‘other men looking at your wife’ than anything else: after all, these men were ‘forward thinking’ enough to marry an actress in the first place. Perhaps they were nervous of the number of early actresses, like Nell, who had affairs with kings and nobles. If so, they had a good few hundred years of uncertainty left: Edward VII was still pretty into actresses at the turn of the twentieth century. ‘I’ve spent enough on you to build a battleship’ he complained to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lillie_Langtry">Lillie Langtry</a> (1853-1929), eliciting the tart response ‘And you’ve spent enough in me to float one.’ (It may have been such impertinence that led to her replacement by another actress, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Bernhardt">Sarah Bernhardt</a>, shortly afterwards.)</p>

<p>But, as this exhibition shows, one of the primary moral gripes with these early actresses was actually about something a bit unexpected: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travesti_(theatre)"><em>travesti</em></a> roles many of them built careers on. There are some fascinating visual representations in this exhibition of actresses – like Dorothy Jordan (1761-1816), whose bosom apparently ‘concealed everything but its own charms’ – in their famous ‘breech’ roles, both Shakespearean (stalwarts like <strong>Twelfth Night</strong> and <strong>As You Like It</strong>) and just… male (Tom Thumb). It seems that, after decades of young boys aping womanhood, the first actresses set themselves the challenge of continuing the noble tradition: it was conscious decision, rather than occasional dramatic necessity, for many of them to adopt the <em>travesti</em>.</p>
<p>The Immodesty here implied resulted in endless caricatures, many of which are exhibited here. My favourite was entitled ‘An Actress at her Toilet; or, <a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/collectionimages/AN00142/AN00142551_001_l.jpg">Miss Brazen Just Breecht’</a> – though perhaps even stranger were the portraits of various male actors, including David Garrick, in drag – enormous hoop and all – as a kind of forerunner to the pantomime dame.</p>
<p>Take a feminist friend and thrash it out in the Portrait Gallery café with their superior yoghurt and granola, says this reviewer. And visit John Donne on the top floor, if he’s not gone into cleaning yet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I know we finished the surprising <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/tag/a-few-of-our-favourite-things/">not-obviously-feminist-films-we-love series</a> a while back, but I just watched <strong>Hairspray</strong> again and had such a familiar rush of affection I thought it was time to put pen to paper. Fingers to keyboard. You know what I mean.</p>
<p>I’ve never seen the more recent musical film version because I love the original so much, but I’d be interested to hear what BadReppers think of it. If you’ve not seen the real thing, here’s the trailer:</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/fdKTHL0PMGw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Made in 1988 by the incomparable <a title="Wikipedia - John Waters" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Waters_%28filmmaker%29" target="_blank"><strong>John Waters</strong></a>, it’s set in 1962 Baltimore. <a title="IMDb - Hairspray (1988)" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095270/">IMDb</a> says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8216;Pleasantly Plump&#8217; teenager Tracy Turnblad achieves her dream of becoming a regular on the Corny Collins Dance Show. Now a teen hero, she starts using her fame to speak out for the causes she believes in, most of all integration. In doing so, she earns the wrath of the show&#8217;s former star, Amber Von Tussle, as well as Amber&#8217;s manipulative, pro-segregation parents. The rivalry comes to a head as Amber and Tracy vie for the title of Miss Auto Show 1963.</p></blockquote>

It’s a delirious, high-camp, queer, irreverent and satirical version of the early 60s that shows <strong>Dirty Dancing</strong> up as the insipid whitewashed pap that it is. (Sorry, but you know I&#8217;m speaking the truth.) Tracy Turnblad, played by Ricki Lake, is a heroine and a half. Big, happy, confident, working class Tracy has a lot of soul and a keen sense of justice. She wins the day, the guy, and the hearts of the town because she can dance, because she’s nice and because she stands up for what she believes in. In this case: civil rights.</p>
<p>What is so refreshing to see even now (perhaps especially now) is a large teenage female character who radiates energy and self-confidence. She’s not a sidekick, she’s the star through and through, and the Elvis-a-like heartthrob falls head over heels for her, as does everyone else. When she dances in triumph with her chain of friends at the end of the film I DEFY YOU not to be cheering her on.</p>
<p>I love her for some of the same reasons I love <a title="Wikipedia - Mae West" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mae_West" target="_blank">Mae West</a> in, well, all her films (she basically plays the same character every time). She’s larger and older than her counterpart spindly 1930s starlets, but in every film the men follow her around with their jaws bumping on the floor. It simultaneously surprises me and makes me think ‘why the hell not?’ She wrote the scripts, anyway – why not cast herself as a sex symbol? She <strong>was</strong> a sex symbol. We’re faced with such a tidal wave of body propaganda it’s easy to internalise it. Here&#8217;s a gratuitous embed of the trailer to West&#8217;s 1933 film <a title="IMDb - I'm No Angel" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0024166/" target="_blank"><strong>I&#8217;m No Angel</strong></a>:</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/qVrfHXnUJFc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Anyway, back to the 80s/60s/whatever planet John Waters comes from. Another thing I love about <strong>Hairspray</strong> is the fabulous supporting cast of characters. <a title="Wikipedia - Divine" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_%28actor%29" target="_blank">Divine</a> as Tracy’s mother Edna steals every scene she’s in, but I also love Tracy&#8217;s best friend Penny (Leslie Ann Powers) who seems pretty drippy until she meets kind, dishy Seaweed, son of local soul queen Motormouth Mabel. It’s actually quiet Penny Pingleton that starts shouting ‘segregation never, integration now!’ outside the Corny Collins Show. Penny and Tracy are touchingly devoted to each other too, encouraging each other and enjoying each other’s happiness. Plus bitchy Amber von Tussle and her snobbish, racist parents (her mother is played by Debbie Harry) are deliciously hateable.</p>
<p>The film is not without its flaws and it definitely won’t be everyone’s cup of tea, but I love it. It’s the only film (I think…) that I’ve ever watched and put on again straight away, though admittedly that’s partly because of the superb soundtrack, which features Lesley Gore’s irresistible anthem <strong>You Don’t Own Me</strong>. Here it is!</p>
