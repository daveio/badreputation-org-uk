										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Explain to me about supercars.</p>
<p>No, seriously. If anyone out there has a clue, please write in and explain to me how anyone can consider them ‘cool’. Now, I like a<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercar"> supercar</a> as much as the next person.  Wait, scratch that. How can I say I like it? I’ve never driven a supercar. I’ve never touched one. I’ve never even seen one in real life close up. (I will obviously have to make an effort at the next motorshow.) So how can I categorically state: yup, that one there, that’s the one for me, the one with the bright orange paintjob and the rotating guns mounted on the spoiler?</p>
<p>I realise <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/03/04/secret-diary-of-a-female-petrolhead-%E2%80%93the-water-cooler-test/">I’ve just finished telling you</a> that I am really quite partial to the <a href="http://www.paganiautomobili.it/zonda/zonda_R/default.aspx">Zonda R</a>, but that’s more of an abstract sort of love. I love it like I love Dali – I’ve no idea what’s going on with it, and would feel vaguely disturbed if I did. But to stand up and say, yup, I’d love to own one? No.</p>

<p>And yet, despite that, I’m having to wage battles over whether or not the <a href="http://www.lotuscars.com/en/lotus-exige">Exige</a> – or the <a href="http://www.koenigsegg.com/cars/agera/">Agera</a>, or the <a href="http://www.astonmartin.com/thecars/one77">One-77</a> – is cool, uncool or just too uncool for words. My logic, for anyone who is interested, is this: <em>if it looks like it’s something a City banker would drive without a hint of irony, there are no words for how uncool it is. </em>Give it up now.</p>
<p>Actually, I don’t see why I should be having this argument at all, because it’s my fridge, and my fridge magnets, and if I decide to have the Exige in the <a href="http://topgear.cloudapp.net/default.aspx">Uncool</a> section, on my own head be it. And still, out it came – “but look at it! It looks like the Batmobile!”</p>
<p>There is, I suspect, a significant difference between engine enthusiasts and car enthusiasts. Both care about what the car has under the bonnet, but the car enthusiasts also care about <a href="http://www.venomgt.com/gallery/x1-top-gear-magazine/">whether or not it looks like a Batmobile</a>. Whereas I actively gravitate towards non-Batmobile cars (they don’t go with my handbag).</p>
<p>Anyway, the point is, I’ve now had a few driving lessons, and have therefore been thinking about what car I would hypothetically buy once I pass my driving test (and before I move to my castle, complete with moat). Meanwhile, my instructor was telling me to stop giving way to people (why? They were busy and going somewhere, whereas I was driving in circles!) and hold my ground. I had to stop being so cooperative, otherwise I would be &#8216;forever taken advantage of&#8217;.</p>
<p>While I was thinking about being less cooperative, I was cut up by a bloke driving a royal blue Ferrari. I can’t swear as to the model, due to the extreme speed at which he almost ran me off the road, but its sloping front looked rather like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrari_Daytona">Ferrari Daytona</a>. Suffice to say I was rather surprised to see one in Clapham, and even more surprised to nearly have it embed itself in the side of the <a href="http://www.fiat.co.uk/showroom/?id=10023#showroom/new_500">Fiat 500</a> I was desperately trying not to stall.</p>
<p>Ah, I thought. <em>That</em> is what I’m supposed to do. That raw, unbridled aggre-</p>
<p>“Was that the same Ferrari I saw on the roundabout a few minutes ago?” my instructor asked. I wouldn’t know, since at the time I was trying to remember which turn I was meant to be taking. But if so &#8211;</p>
<p>“Why is that bloke driving around pointlessly?”</p>
<p>As several Very Busy Persons behind me decided to improve my driving skills by honking their horns and pointing out that I should have allowed the Daytona-alike and my little Fiat to merge rather than braking and therefore delaying them by 3.4 seconds, I pondered the problem of the supercar. Even a Ferrari seemed a little pointless in South London. Surely anyone who drove one would either have to buy their own corner of Monte Carlo, or would otherwise have to face running for a pint of milk in something that looks like it should ram other cars for daring to share road space.</p>

<p>I’m going to have to decline. I’d much rather drive something that didn’t automatically make people hate me from miles away.</p>
<p>I’ve settled on an Alfa 166. No, it&#8217;s not a supercar.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s better.</p>
