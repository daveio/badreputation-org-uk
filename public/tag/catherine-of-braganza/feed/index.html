					<description><![CDATA[Tea in its origins is something specifically feminine, and historically a key element in women's domestic lives.The woman who held the key to the tea-chest was the woman who made the tea, and whole family power structures could hang on which woman this 'mother' was.]]></description>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">TEA</h2>
<blockquote><p>Make tea, child, said my kind mamma. Sit by me, love, and make tea.</p>
<p>Samuel Richardson, <strong>Clarissa </strong>(1747)</p></blockquote>
<p>Ah, the Joke Post comes upon us at last. T is for &#8216;t&#8217;&#8230; very droll. I lift a cup to that. But fie! Have we learned nothing on this lexical journey? First and foremost, <em>tea </em>was not always pronounced as we currently say it: when it first appeared in English in 1601 it was <em>&#8216;taaaaay</em>&#8216; and often written <em>tay </em>(like the modern French <em>thé</em>, a bit). It is not quite clear when and why the shift to &#8216;ti&#8217; happened, but, then, few things are as easy to lose sight of as pronunciation (how many people remember that Keats was a Cockney?)</p>

<p><em>Tea</em>, of course, has the additional complication that it is not an English word (although what is?) – it came from the Dutch <em>thee</em>, in turn from Malay and, eventually, Chinese Amoy dialect: <em>t&#8217;e</em>, or the Mandarin <em>ch&#8217;a. </em>Woven into the geographical etymology, then, is a legacy of import history: around the mid-seventeenth century we procured our tea from the Dutch, who imported it from Malaysia and, ultimately, China. What exactly were they importing? Why, <em>tea</em>&#8216;s first definition, of course: &#8216;the leaves of the tea-plant, usually in a dried and prepared state for making the drink&#8217;. In this form,<em> tea</em> began with a queen, and quickly became every eighteenth-century Cosmo girl&#8217;s first route of seduction.</p>
<h3>Brew and Thunder.</h3>
<p>But first &#8211; the drink. &#8216;Made by infusing these leaves in boiling water, having a somewhat bitter and aromatic flavour, and acting as a moderate stimulant&#8217; &#8211; in this sense, the word <em>tea </em>is first recorded around 1601, so some trendsetters must have been aware of it before the widespread importing of the later seventeenth century, when <em>tea </em>really came into its own: Samuel Pepys tried it in 1660, and a couple of years later it found a celebrity backer in the <a href="http://www.oceansbridge.com/paintings/museums/national-portrait-gallery/Catherine-of-Braganza.jpg">be-farthingaled</a> shape of the Portuguese queen consort to Charles II, Catherine of Braganza (<a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/01/10/an-alphabet-of-femininism-13-m-is-for-marriage/">remember her</a>?). So, in England at least, <em>tea </em>was from the beginning tending towards the female of the species.</p>
<p>Catherine&#8217;s tea-drinking was partly to do with Portugal&#8217;s colonial links with Asia, but also with her <a href="http://www.britannia.com/history/biographies/catherine_braganza.html">temperament</a>: solemn and pious, she initially had trouble fitting into the Protestant English court and her preference for a &#8216;moderate stimulant&#8217; over the ales and beers otherwise drunk marked one of many departures. But <em>tea </em>was quickly owning its stimulating qualities and being marketed as a &#8216;tonic&#8217;, a civilized alternative to alcohol capable of soothing aches&#8217;n&#8217;pains and spurring on mental capacities: a zeitgeist for the intellectual impetus of the early Enlightenment &#8211; as against Charles II&#8217;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2kyNbZc7oc">well-known debauchery</a> &#8211; and, in fact, a &#8216;<a href="http://hunch.com/asterix-characters/falbala-panacea/2760474/">panacea</a>&#8216;:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hail, Queen of Plants, Pride of <strong>Elysian </strong>Bow&#8217;rs!<br />
How shall we speak thy complicated Powr&#8217;s?<br />
Thou wondrous <strong>Panacea</strong>, to asswage<br />
The Calentures of Youth&#8217;s fermenting rage,<br />
And animate the freezing veins of age.</p>
<p>Nahum Tate, from <strong>Panacea: A Poem Upon Tea </strong>(1700)</p></blockquote>
<p>But what started out as a Portuguese import became a matter of English national identity, and by the next century London&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company">East India Company </a>had established a monopoly on trade, controlling imports into Britain (and thus, prices), using its extensive trade links with Queen Catherine&#8217;s dowry –then-Bombay – and the East Indies, and Asia. It was thus that the English turned not into a nation of coffee drinkers, but to devotees of the &#8216;Queen of Plants&#8217;. And a queen she certainly was, and not entirely distinct from the maternal and oft-secluded <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne,_Queen_of_Great_Britain">Queen Anne</a>, who dramatically reduced the size of the English court and inspired a new fashion for calm domesticity and politeness. Thus, the bustling male-dominated <a href="http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd's_of_London#Formation">coffee-houses</a>, but also a more feminine fix at home&#8230;</p>
<h3>Five Leaves Left.</h3>
<p>So in 1738 <em>tea </em>came to mean not just some withered leaf, but also an opportunity for socialising! Hurrah! To be precise, <em>tea </em>became &#8216;a meal or social entertainment at which tea is served; especially an ordinary afternoon or evening meal, at which the usual beverage is tea&#8217;. The fact that it could connote an &#8216;ordinary afternoon meal&#8217; made <em>tea </em>a convenient beverage to offer casual social callers, although it was also, of course, a beverage that demanded a whole host of conspicuous purchases: a full tea-set and the crucial Other Element – sugar. Thus your tea-table represented Britain&#8217;s colonial interests off in China and India to the tea-side, and Africa and the East Indies to the sugar-side, with all the attendant horrors of the emergent slave trade conveniently swept under the (Persian) rug.</p>

Photo par Hodge.</p></div>
<p>The conspicuous consumption <em>tea </em>represented was exacerbated by its price: before mass importation in the mid-century had driven costs down, the leaf itself was fixed at so extortionate a price (a bargain in 1680 was 30s a pound) as to necessitate the purchase of a lockable tea-chest, which would become the responsibility first of the lady of the house, and, when age-appropriate, of her daughter. The woman who held the key to the tea-chest was, naturally, also the woman who made the tea &#8211; thus &#8216;Shall I be mother?&#8217;, a phrase of uncertain origin. One theory I came across was that it is a Victorian idiom related to the phenomenon of women unable to breastfeed naturally using teapot spouts to convey milk to their infant instead. OH THE SYMBOLISM.</p>
<p>Whatever the phrase&#8217;s specific origins, it&#8217;s certainly true that from <em>tea</em>&#8216;s domestic beginnings onwards whole family power structures could hang on which woman this &#8216;mother&#8217; was. Alas, London&#8217;s major galleries forbid image reproduction (WAAH), but if you turn to <a href="http://images.npg.org.uk/790_500/9/2/mw08292.jpg">your handouts</a>,  you will see this in action. This is the Tyers family: that&#8217;s Mr Tyers on the left, and his son just down from one of the universities. His daughter, on the far right, is about to be married (she&#8217;s putting her gloves on to go out &#8211; out of the door and out of the family). Her role as tea-maker has, in consequence, passed onto her younger sister, who now sits as squarely in the middle of the family portrait as she does in the family sphere. Conversely, in <strong>Clarissa</strong>, when the heroine angers her parents they sack her from her tea-task and grotesquely divide it up among other family members (&#8220;My heart was up at my mouth. I did not know what to do with myself&#8221;, she recalls, distraught. I WANTED TO MAKE TEA!).</p>
<h3>And she feeds you tea and oranges&#8230;</h3>
<p>Of course, while assigning the tea-making to your daughter could be a loving gesture of trust, it also pimped her marriageability: it requires a cool head and calm demeanour to remember five-plus milk&#8217;n&#8217;sugar preferences, judge the strength of the tea and pour it, all the while making small-talk and remaining attentive to your guests. Add to this the weighty responsibility of locking the tea away from thieving servants and you have the management skills of housewifery in miniature. It also showed off physical charms: poise, posture, the elegant turn of a wrist, a beautifully framed bosom. To take this momentarily out of the salon, no respectable punter would get down in an eighteenth-century brothel without first taking tea with the girls: <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanny_Hill">Fanny Hill</a> </strong>spends at least as much time drinking tea as (<em>That&#8217;s enough – Ed</em>), and, of course, this kind of performative tea-ritual femininity is a mainstay in the professional life of the Japanese <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geisha">geisha</a>.</p>
<p>So, along with its identity as a colonial mainstay in Britain&#8217;s trading life, <em>tea </em>in its origins is also something specifically feminine: a kind of Muse inspiring intellectual greatness, a Queen to be worshipped as a symbol of Britain&#8217;s health and power, and a key element in the women&#8217;s domestic lives. It could be stimulating, relaxing and seductive, but,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Tea_Party"> as would become disastrously clear</a>, it was always political.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Before all our newfangled post-Romantic notions of individualism, marriage was much less dewy-eyed. It required nothing more than parental consent, and its functions were social, religious and legal. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<h6 style="text-align: center;">M</h6>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">MARRIAGE</h2>
<blockquote><p>Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife, and they shall be one flesh.</p>
<p>Genesis 2.24</p></blockquote>
<p>So begins <em>marriage. </em>In this day and age, most people think of such &#8216;cleaving&#8217; as kinda cute, an emotional commitment &#8220;&#8217;til death do us part&#8221;; and indeed the union matrimony represents (&#8216;bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh&#8217;) begins with the word&#8217;s Latin ancestor, the double-gendered <em>maritus / marita </em>(= &#8216;husband / wife&#8217;). Ever-efficient, the Romans join husband and wife in one word, giving us, in miniature, <em>marriage&#8217;s </em>first definition: &#8216;the relation between married persons; wedlock&#8217;.</p>

<p>But<em> </em>before all our newfangled post-Romantic notions of individualism, <em>marriage</em> was much less dewy-eyed. It required nothing more than parental consent, and its functions were social, religious and legal. Firstly, it acknowledged a sexual relationship and those children born within it, thus easing the financial burden of bastard upkeep on society and oiling the cogs of inheritance. Secondly, it was a Holy Sacrament, an institution to prevent sin, though it did <strong>not</strong> sanction guilt-free sex – too much <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/11/29/an-alphabet-of-femininism-9-i-is-for-infant/">fun with your wife</a>, and it became <em>adultery</em> (= &#8216;pollution of the marriage bed&#8217;).</p>
<p>Finally – then as now – <em>marriage </em>linked families, dynasties, and countries together &#8216;in-law&#8217;, in a way that could be personal, symbolic, or world-changing: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P27r-DERSRo">new money</a> meeting <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/britain/exhibitions/hogarth/modernmorals/marriagealamode.shtm">impoverished aristocracy</a>; the Venetian Doge annually &#8216;marrying&#8217; the sea; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_of_Braganza">Catherine of Braganza</a> bringing England £300,000, Bombay and Tangier as her dowry. In extension, it helped negotiate the legal exchange of worldly goods, including a dower for the bride should she survive her groom, inheritance for the children, and the resolution of all money matters under the auspices of the <em>pater familias.</em> So it was impossible for a wife to run up debt, to own property, or, in any sense, to <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/11/29/an-alphabet-of-femininism-9-i-is-for-infant/">exist independently of her husband</a>. In consequence, <em>marriage </em>became the Holy Grail for 99.9% of young women, who dreaded remaining financially dependent on rich relations or married sisters should the marriage-market reject them (as it did, if you were the wrong side of one in three aristocratic women).</p>
<h3>&#8230;if U ain&#8217;t busy for the next 7 years&#8230;</h3>
<p>Phew. In its second definition <em>marriage</em> takes up the legal challenge, becoming &#8216;the action, or act, of marrying; the ceremony by which two persons are made husband and wife&#8217;.</p>

<p>The non-specifics here are no accident: to the irritation of the early modern church, &#8216;contract marriages&#8217; and Dodgy Marriage more generally (<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gretna_Green">Scotch Marriages</a> </em>or <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleet_Marriage">Fleet Marriages</a></em>) endured for centuries before the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_Act_1753">Marriage Act</a> of 1753 put paid to such shenanigans and demanded a public service or none at all. Previously, &#8216;the ceremony by which two persons are made husband and wife&#8217; could be an exchange of bent or halved coins, the presentation of a ring, or a declaration (&#8216;I make you my wife&#8217;). There were certain caveats to this last, of course &#8211; you had to use the present tense (no conditionals), unless you used the future and then tumbled into bed: present consummation is present consent.</p>
<p>All very neat, in theory, although such <em>marriages</em> generally took place on the hoof between impetuous couples and only became of real significance once the bride fell pregnant or one or both of the parties got into difficulties. Then you get into semantics: what does &#8216;will&#8217; mean, exactly? It&#8217;s an uncooperative word, conflating what you &#8216;want&#8217; and what you &#8216;will do&#8217;. Church courts agreed, and many of those marriages that were challenged were dissolved, with an inevitably skewed impact on the would-be wife.</p>
<p>So marriage is as much about <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/11/29/an-alphabet-of-femininism-9-i-is-for-infant/">speech and silence</a> as &#8216;cleaving&#8217;: moreover, much of its value depends on the weight society gives how you live (today, you can lose your state benefits if you &#8216;<a href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/MoneyTaxAndBenefits/BenefitsTaxCreditsAndOtherSupport/BeginnersGuideToBenefits/DG_4016267">live with another person as if you are married</a>&#8216;). It also creates interesting problems if you are physically silenced before you can assert your consent (as happens in Manzoni&#8217;s novel <strong>The Betrothed</strong>), or if your marriage is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etXMgEJPZRA">explosively interrupted</a>, as in Fassbinder&#8217;s film <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Marriage_of_Maria_Braun">The Marriage of Maria Braun</a></strong>. Conversely, Renaissance actors wondered what God thought about marriages carried out on stage as part of a performance: valid or not? Why not? This whole idea is, in essence, the premise of Tim Burton&#8217;s <strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p_afU59YMQ">The Corpse Bride</a> </strong>(2004), where nobody questions the legality of Victor&#8217;s (clearly accidental) declaration to the bride of the title, despite trying every other conceivable method to get him out of it.</p>
<h3>&#8230;Let&#8217;s pretend we&#8217;re married and go all night.</h3>
<p>The word <em>marriage </em>reflects this in a now-obsolete sense, as &#8216;intimate union&#8217;, antonymic to<em> virginity</em>. And here I nearly tripped up on another little tradition: breach of promise, a common law tort allowing a partner to sue their long-fled lover for damages based on the impact of such &#8216;intimate union&#8217; but also on the value of language – &#8216;Does she know how you told me you&#8217;d hold me until you die? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPcyTyilmYY">Well you&#8217;re still alive</a>&#8230;&#8217;</p>
<p>This tort was overwhelmingly used by women, although originally payable to the father of a seduced girl, who had lost &#8216;services&#8217; (make me a cuppa, love) because of her pregnancy. Later on, it became a means of quantifying waste of time, reputation and trousseau-money in a marriage market competitive enough that such things mattered. Although the tort was abolished in the UK in 1970, a version is still in use elsewhere: a jilted woman in Chicago is currently <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/jilted-bride-sues-groom-95000/story?id=12403921">suing her fiance</a> for the costs of her cancelled wedding, and &#8217;emotional distress&#8217;. Whether or not she will succeed is unclear, but her early-modern precursors inevitably triumphed:</p>
<blockquote><p>See my interesting client<br />
Victim of a heartless wile!<br />
See the traitor all defiant ,<br />
Wears a supercilious smile!<br />
Sweetly smiled my client on him<br />
Coyly wooed and gently won him&#8230;.</p>
<p>W.S. Gilbert, <a href="http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/trial/libretto.txt">Trial By Jury</a> (1875)</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Trial By Jury </strong>explains why the tort was so useful to jilted women, but also why it declined: by 1875 female financial options were expanding enough to change the public perception of such cases from &#8216;poor innocent maid vs. base seducer&#8217; to &#8216;I ain&#8217;t sayin&#8217; she&#8217;s a gold digger&#8230;&#8217; So what began as a way to compensate gender inequality itself ended as a vehicle for misogyny, with stories of pretty girls luring men in and then threatening to do the legal equivalent of &#8216;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_William">thcreaming and thcreaming until i&#8217;m thick</a>&#8216;. What God has joined, let no man put asunder.</p>
