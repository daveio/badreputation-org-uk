					<description><![CDATA[If you remember the Alphabet of Feminism, this one's for you. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Ed&#8217;s note:</strong> In the original Alphabet we did <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/10/18/an-alphabet-of-femininism-3-c-is-for-crinoline/" target="_blank">&#8216;C is for Crinoline&#8217;</a> &#8211; but here&#8217;s something we thought was topically worth coming back to.</p>
<h6 style="text-align: center;">C</h6>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">CHIVALRY</h2>
<blockquote><p>Chivalry is dead, but you&#8217;re still kinda cute.</p>
<p>&#8211; Nelly Furtado, <strong>Promiscuous</strong> (2006)</p></blockquote>
<p>Chivalry. Not one of feminism&#8217;s most pressing issues, but definitely one of its more genteel <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/01/25/keep-the-gift-pay-what-you-owe/" target="_blank">debates</a>.</p>
<p>Do you, as an attractive female who also happens to be a feminist, deign to take the seat that dude offers you on the crowded tube or laugh hollowly and stick your head back in your neighbour&#8217;s armpit? Is chivalry OK?</p>
<p>Personally, my view on this debate is always affected by the point that 99% of the men I&#8217;ve met who talk about chivalry with misty-eyed fervour are also the kind of Nice Guys who Really Aren&#8217;t Very Nice At All.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not for here.</p>
<p>What I am interested in is looking at its complex linguistic heritage.</p>
<h2>Horses</h2>
<p>What&#8217;s that sound in the distance?</p>
<p>Why, it&#8217;s the sound of clopping hooves &#8211; and<em> chivalry</em>&#8216;s etymological root come to join us. Neiiigh.</p>

<p>For though <em>chivalry<strong> </strong></em>in English means (first definition ahoy!)  &#8216;the code of behaviour demonstrated<em> by a perfect knight</em>&#8216;, were we French we&#8217;d replace &#8216;knight&#8217; with &#8216;<em>chevalier</em>&#8216;, or &#8216;horseman&#8217; &#8211; from the root word <em>cheval</em> (= &#8216;horse&#8217;).</p>
<p>The knight, or <em>chevalier</em>, is <em> </em>in origin a nobleman on horseback who goes around rescuing maidens and fighting dragons. He is <em>chivalrous </em>in behaviour, displaying (the word&#8217;s second definition) &#8216;courage, honour, justice and readiness to help the weak&#8217;.</p>
<p>Key examples can be found in the legends of King Arthur and his horsebacked Knights of the Round Table &#8211; in particular Sir Gawain and the so-good-he-couldn&#8217;t-be-gooder Sir Percival (who later becomes Wagner&#8217;s <strong>Parsifal</strong>).</p>
<p>The chivalrous are those on horseback.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s the secondary meaning of <em>chivalry</em> that we best recognise today: &#8216;<em>courteous</em> behaviour, especially towards women&#8217; (that is, giving up your seat on the tube, which Percival would totally have done if he didn&#8217;t travel everywhere by <em>cheval</em>).<em> </em></p>
<h2>Courtly-powered lovin&#8217;</h2>
<p>Chivalry &#8211; and the <em>courtesy </em>that defines it &#8211; is also the base idea behind <em>courtly</em> <em>love</em>, which the devoted may remember we addressed separately in the <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/12/20/an-alphabet-of-femininism-12-l-is-for-lady/" target="_blank">Alphabet Glory Days</a>.</p>

<p>This is what the knights are doing when they&#8217;re not out fighting &#8211;  sighing for love among rose bushes, swooning at the touch of a <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/11/01/an-alphabet-of-femininism-5-e-is-for-emancipate/" target="_blank">&#8216;lily-white hand&#8217;</a> and <em>definitely </em>giving up their seats for a woman on the medieval commute.</p>
<p>And it was said to have been invented by a woman, Eleanor of Aquitaine.</p>
<p>Before she married Henry II and brought her French customs over to England, Eleanor had a period presiding alone over a predominantly male grouping in Poitiers.It seems inventing an elaborate code of chaste devotion to a single lady &#8211; <em>court</em>eous behaviour, if you will &#8211; was a good way for Eleanor to bring these bored and potentially restless knights into order &#8211; and, I assume, to block potential sexual aggression at the same time (cf. the court of Elizabeth I, which saw a resurgence of &#8216;courtly&#8217; devotion to &#8216;Gloriana&#8217;, the &#8216;Virgin <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/02/07/an-alphabet-of-femininism-17-q-is-for-queen/" target="_blank">Queen</a>&#8216;).</p>
<h2>Courtship</h2>
<p>With these courtly roots, it&#8217;s appropriate that, during the English Civil War, the word <em>chevalier </em>should lend itself so enthusiastically to the Royalist cause in fighting for king (and court).</p>
<p>In this context, the Cavaliers were enemies to the Roundheads and cousins to <em>chevaliers</em> via the Latin source-word &#8216;cabellarius&#8217; (also meaning &#8216;horseman&#8217;).</p>
<p>The origin of this term is actually pre-war, in the grouping of courtly &#8216;cavaliers&#8217; at the original Carolingian court (a bit like the courtly lovers at Poitiers).</p>
<p>These included the &#8216;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavalier_poet" target="_blank">Cavalier poets</a>&#8216;, a conglomerate of literary courtiers formed by the King himself, including Robert Herrick and Edmund Waller.</p>
<p>The term in this usage is ambiguous, though. On the one hand, <em>cavalier</em> was often used in allusion to the King&#8217;s refined (indeed &#8216;knightly&#8217;) sensibilities, which, incidentally, included a famous love of horses &#8211; as the many magnificent equestrian portraits of him attest.</p>
<p>But, in a pejorative sense, the <em>cavalier poets </em>were so named because they were famously &#8216;roistering gallants&#8217; and &#8216;libertines&#8217;. This is <em>cavalier</em>&#8216;s other meaning: &#8216;haughty, disdainful or supercilious&#8217; or &#8216;offhand and unceremonious&#8217; (a bit like wearing your hat at a<a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/02/14/an-alphabet-of-femininism-18-r-is-for-rake/" target="_blank"> &#8216;rakish&#8217; angle</a>).</p>
<p>So <em>cavalier </em>is almost a contraction in terms.</p>
<h2>The Don</h2>
<p>This is the very ambiguity we find in Mozart&#8217;s great libertine opera, <strong>Don Giovanni</strong>, written about 100 years later. The &#8216;Don&#8217; is a nobleman and serial womaniser. He&#8217;s a standard-issue<a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/02/14/an-alphabet-of-femininism-18-r-is-for-rake/" target="_blank"> rake</a>, in fact: we learn in the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fccdGBi9JUs&amp;t=2m30s" target="_blank">Catalogue Song</a> that he&#8217;s seduced 1,003 women in Spain alone.</p>

<p>He is throughout referred to in the Italian as a &#8216;cavalier&#8217;, understood (and, for us English-speakers, translated) according to context variously as &#8216;gentleman&#8217; (nobleman on horseback) and &#8216;rake&#8217; (careless womaniser) &#8211; as in the opera&#8217;s subtitle, &#8216;Il <em>dissoluto</em> punito&#8217; (&#8216;the debauchee punished&#8217;).</p>
<p>Thus, when Don Giovanni takes the pretty peasant girl Zerlina away from her finance, Masetto, to show her his castle (no, really), Don Giovanni &#8216;reassures&#8217; the jealous Masetto by saying he needn&#8217;t worry &#8211; his fiancee is &#8216;in the hands of a <em>cavalier</em>&#8216;.Unfortunately, that&#8217;s exactly what Masetto is afraid of. &#8220;Let the<em> cavaliere </em>make a <em>cavaliera</em> out of you!&#8221; he trumpets at the departing Zerlina &#8211; he knows what&#8217;s going down (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q40a23gfxZE" target="_blank">this</a>).</p>
<h2>Court to City</h2>
<p>Back to English climes.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the eighteenth century, Queen Anne halved the size of the English court and moved it out of central London.</p>
<p>In so doing, she ultimately ended up transferring power from court to city &#8211; and <em>courtesy </em>became <em></em>civility (from the Latin <em>cives</em> (= the city)).</p>

<p>This is the age of opening doors, watching your language and standing up when a woman enters the room. Chivalry has gone domestic; men are <em>civil </em>now in Britain. Only the hot-headed Italian Don Giovannis are still <em>cavaliers</em>.</p>
<p>But when Samuel Richardson wanted to depict a perfect (but domestic) Englishman, he still made him an aristocratic knight (<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sir</span> Charles Grandison</strong>). Jane Austen did too: her paragon of virtue (himself based on Sir Charles), is pointedly named Mr <em>Knightly</em> (<strong>Emma</strong>).By this point it&#8217;s faded away to a name rather than a title, but the gentleman still has a vestigial horse (if you will).</p>
<h2>White Knights</h2>
<p>Strangely enough, the vestigial horse becomes more literal in the modern age, in the form of the ladies&#8217; proverbial &#8216;ideal man&#8217; &#8211; a chivalrous gentleman. Mr Right is also a &#8216;knight in shining armour&#8217;.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s even a  Lewis Carroll-esque &#8216;White Knight&#8217;, a noble rescuer (as in the song &#8216;My White Knight&#8217; from Meredith Wilson&#8217;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_oyzwsJOhU" target="_blank"><strong>The Music Man</strong></a>, where the knight in question will, her mother thinks, &#8216;save&#8217; Marian the Librarian from Old Maidery).</p>
<p>Remember when Grace first meets Leo &#8211; the Great Romance &#8211; in <strong>Will and Grace</strong>? He&#8217;s on a horse in Central Park. That&#8217;s how you know he&#8217;s a Big Deal Romance.</p>
<h2>Never trust a man on horseback</h2>
<p>And, to conclude very crudely, I suppose this is what happened to <em>chivalry </em>.</p>
<p>It became the polite behaviour of the  gentleman &#8211; enshrined in tradition and developed over a couple of hundred years to become our friend offering me a seat on the bustling 21st century commute<strong> </strong>and sitcom single girls dreaming of their &#8216;Mr Darcy&#8217;.</p>
<p>But I still hear the sound of clopping hooves. The fantasy may be more Sir Gawain than Don Giovanni, but you know what they say &#8211; the apple never falls far from the lexical tree.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">HYSTERIA</h2>
<blockquote><p>O, how this mother swells up toward my heart!<br />
<em>Hysterica passio</em>, down, thou climbing sorrow,<br />
Thy element&#8217;s below.<br />
&#8211; King Lear, II.ii.246</p></blockquote>
<h3>No Reason To Get Excited</h3>
<p>In its purest sense, <em>hysteria </em>simply refers to the womb, no more, no less; like all those other lovely hy- words, it<em> </em>comes from the Greeks, and specifically from their word <em>hysterikos &#8211; hystera</em> (= yes, &#8216;womb&#8217;. Think &#8216;hysterectomy&#8217;). There may be little trace of its origin in modern usage, but its &#8216;female&#8217; signification is perfectly in line with the word&#8217;s association with legions of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_O.">Anna Os</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dora_(case_study)">Doras</a> and Victorian virgins, eyes rolling, bodies attractively prone.</p>

<p>But here we must pause, and take an exciting medical-historical diversion. The Latin equivalent of <em>hysterikos </em>is the homonymic ancestor of our modern term &#8216;uterus&#8217;, and means &#8216;womb&#8217; or &#8216;belly&#8217;; and this last strangely ambiguous definition seems less odd when you realise that &#8216;womb&#8217; itself, in its Old English form, refers not to the generative organ but to a &#8216;belly&#8217; or &#8216;paunch&#8217; and that history is full of scientists arguing that this now-feminized organ was gender-neutral, with the &#8216;female&#8217; womb simply some kind of equivalent to the &#8216;male&#8217; stomach. Well? It does have some kind of logic: both are cavernous places where you, er, store stuff, but the female of the species may be more creative than the male.</p>
<h3>Oh, Mother.</h3>
<p>So, grasping this information in our sweaty little palms, to Shakespeare. When King Lear complains of &#8216;this mother&#8217; he is referring to, as he says, &#8216;Passio Hysterica&#8217;, or &#8216;the suffocation of the mother&#8217; – <em>mother </em>here used as a synonym for &#8216;womb&#8217;, as in Edward Jorden&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Jorden">Treatise </a>on the subject. Contemporary medical belief held that there were circumstances (Jorden specifies &#8216;of a wind in the bottom of the belly&#8217;, but refuses to elaborate on whether this is indigestion or some meterological force) in which this sexless womb-stomach could physically wander round the body, where &#8216;it causeth a very painfull collicke in the stomack, and an extraordinary giddiness in the head&#8217;. Uh, yeah: ouch. Or, in Lear&#8217;s terms: &#8216;O me, my heart! My rising heart! But down!&#8217;</p>
<h3>She&#8217;s Lost Control.</h3>
<p>The development of  the female-specific womb<em> </em>may be a topic for another day, but <em>hysteria </em>meaning what we would understand by the term, &#8216;hysteric fits or convulsions, a convulsive fit of laughter or weeping&#8217; was in use as early as 1727. In 1791, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart wrote what is arguably the first attempt to put <em>hysteria </em>into musical form &#8211; with <em>The Magic Flute</em>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsywSI10B4Y">Queen of the Night</a>, also a &#8216;mother&#8217; – spectacular as the music is (and her arias in particular), its driving purpose is to contrast the hysterical irrationality of women with the enlightened forces of Men and Freemasonry (gendering <em>hysteria </em>explicitly female in the process).</p>

<p>There is then a gap in the word&#8217;s lexical development until the medical issue resurfaces: <em>hysteria </em>as a diagnosable condition was first officially used in 1801, where, as the dictionary points out, it was in reference to a seeming epidemic of women Going Crazy – or, specifically, experiencing &#8216;a functional disturbance of the nervous system, characterized by anaesthesia, hyperaesthesia, convulsions, etc., and usually attended with emotional disturbances or perversion of the moral and intellectual faculties&#8217;. Covering all its bases, you could either have no sensation at all, or hyper-sensation. Brilliant. That&#8217;s exactly what today needed.</p>
<h3>It&#8217;s Not Easy Being Green.</h3>
<p>One explanation for its seeming explosion during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries is its use as a catch-all term for Generic Women&#8217;s Troubles (hence calling it, essentially, &#8216;womb-problem&#8217;), and indeed, it does seem to have been partially conflated with chlorosis (a type of anaemia), which is perhaps better known to Renaissance drama fans as &#8216;green sickness&#8217;. Thus, in John Ford&#8217;s play <em>&#8216;Tis Pity She&#8217;s A Whore </em>(you&#8217;d think you couldn&#8217;t top that title, wouldn&#8217;t you?) Annabella is thought to be suffering from &#8216;an overflux of youth&#8217;, in which case &#8216;there is no such present remedy as present marriage&#8217;. Translation: get a willy in her, quick.</p>
<p>Something along these lines, dubbed &#8216;pelvic massage&#8217;, was indeed considered to be a helpful course of action for hysterical women of later years, and this, bizarrely, is where the vibrator makes its entrance on the historical stage. Helped along in its retail life by widespread use of electricity in the home, this particular modern gadget was originally a time-saving device for hard-pressed, fee-jealous doctors with hundreds of hysterical women to bring to &#8216;hysterical paroxysm&#8217; before lunch. It was a young medical man named Sigmund Freud who decided that the &#8216;talking cure&#8217; might be more helpful, and his early work in hysteria underscored much of his subsequent work on psychoanalysis.</p>
<h3>Pervert Doc Caged</h3>
<p>In its post-medical life (unsurprisingly, it is no longer considered a valid diagnosis), <em>hysteria </em>continues to rejoice in its second definition, a figurative use, meaning &#8216;unhealthy emotion or excitement&#8217; (1839). Its most common modern usage would probably be in reference to <em>media hysteria</em>, which does, alas, tend to be aimed at women: the <em>Daily Mail</em>, the archetypal screeching tabloid, was, from its initiation in 1896, a newspaper aimed at women, and to this day its readership is over 50% female. As such, it tends to focus on condemning threats to &#8216;traditional family values&#8217; – primarily immigrants and those on benefits, but it also simmers with barely suppressed homophobia (&#8216;Abortion hope after &#8220;gay genes&#8221; finding&#8217; was a headline from 1993, and Jan Moir&#8217;s <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-1220756/A-strange-lonely-troubling-death--.html">article</a> on Stephen Gately more recently attracted justified ire from all corners).</p>
<p>This, sadly, does tend to suggest that in the eyes of<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J48Hy3p3Bm0&amp;feature=related"> People Trying To Sell Us Stuff</a>, women are still very much the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_XOIRDYqzk">hysterical creatures</a> they were considered in the nineteenth century. Unfortunately, this does not stop legions of women actually buying what they sell.</p>
