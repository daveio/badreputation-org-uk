										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, this is number one in an (hopefully) ongoing series of images, videos, photos, comics, posters or excerpts &#8211; anything really, which shows <strong>feminist ideas at work in the everyday world</strong>. What I want to do with this series is to show that as well as all the things that can make us angry, upset or just plain mystified, there are also lots of instances where people are positively engaging with feminism by coming into contact with it in their daily lives and as part of their normal routine.</p>
<p>My offering for today is a music video that stood out from the usual in that it&#8217;s a hip hop video that does not contain women in bikinis. Quite the reverse, it explores a subject rather dear to my heart &#8211; the different societal rules and roles for men and women. The <a href="http://www.metrolyrics.com/like-a-boy-lyrics-ciara.html">lyrics are here</a>, if you want to sing along. Oh, and there is some awesome dancing in it too, with women doing moves more usually associated with their male counterparts.</p>

<p>Looking forward to receiving your own contributions &#8211; and thoughts on the subject. Please email us with them &#8211; <strong>badrepeditors@gmail.com</strong> with the title &#8220;found feminism&#8221;.</p>
