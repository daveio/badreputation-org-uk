										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have decided to ape some of the monthly features of gaming print mags and introduce a “What I’ve been playing…” summary post.  Sometimes I can play very few games and other times I can get through quite a bit; more to the point, there&#8217;s always something to say but often it might not be strictly in the feminist vein, or there might not be <em>enough</em> to develop into a full article.  So this post will be a bit of a test run – I know we’re in February now but I’m looking back at the completed month of Jan here – let’s see how we go, shall we?</p>
<h3>Batman: Arkham City</h3>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/ac.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="9753" data-permalink="/2012/02/13/gamer-diary-what-ive-been-playing-january-2012/ac/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/ac.jpg?fit=303%2C167&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="303,167" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Batman: Arkham City" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/ac.jpg?fit=300%2C165&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/ac.jpg?fit=303%2C167&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9753" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/ac-300x165.jpg?resize=300%2C165" alt="Batman logo with the words &quot;Arkham City&quot; in red beneath - on a white background." width="300" height="165" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/ac.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/ac.jpg?w=303&amp;ssl=1 303w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>There were ‘issues’ with <strong><a title="Wikipedia - Arkham City" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkham_City" target="_blank">Arkham City</a></strong> (as you can read in my <a title="[Gamer Diary] Batman: Arkham Asylum &amp; Arkham City, or; The Bat and his Bitches" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/01/30/gamer-diary-batman-arkham-asylum-arkham-city-or-the-bat-and-his-bitches/">previous article</a>), but there were still some good things to say as well.  The styling and the graphics were great (as they were in <strong><a title="Wikipedia - Arkham Asylum" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_Arkham_Asylum" target="_blank">Asylum</a></strong>), and I enjoyed the noir feel that they went for, although it didn’t feel as gritty as the first game.  I suspect that may be because once you’ve seen something for the first time it loses its special impact.</p>
<p><strong>City</strong> felt a bit <em>too</em> big coming after <strong>Asylum</strong> without the storyline longevity to really back it up.  There&#8217;re a lot of side quests and other bits to do and investigate, so the game has expanded in width as opposed to length.  Personally, I tend to let the side quests fall by the wayside as I power through the story.  It was a fairly competent and engaging(ish) story until the ending (I won’t spoiler but it sucked) despite the near ‘<em>deus ex machina</em>’ way in which they ended the stories of four key characters.</p>
<p>Playing as Catwoman was novel to begin with, but in the end wasn’t a big enough plus as one might have hoped.  Adding to the boiling pot were even more gadgets and even more complicated combat moves that you had to remember in order to beat certain baddies.  Overall, I think they over-complicated a sound concept that could’ve done a lot better.  If you played the first game and are thinking about getting <strong>City</strong>, wait until it comes down in price first or until they release a copy with the DLCs included.</p>
<h3>Assassin’s Creed II</h3>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/250px-Assassins_Creed_2_Box_Art.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="9754" data-permalink="/2012/02/13/gamer-diary-what-ive-been-playing-january-2012/250px-assassins_creed_2_box_art/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/250px-Assassins_Creed_2_Box_Art.jpg?fit=250%2C354&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="250,354" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Assassin&#8217;s Creed II box art" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/250px-Assassins_Creed_2_Box_Art.jpg?fit=211%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/250px-Assassins_Creed_2_Box_Art.jpg?fit=250%2C354&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-9754 alignright" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/250px-Assassins_Creed_2_Box_Art-211x300.jpg?resize=148%2C210" alt="The image feature a man in hooded robes facing forward with two blades coming from contraptions on his wrists. The title reads &quot;Assasin's Creed II&quot; above him." width="148" height="210" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/250px-Assassins_Creed_2_Box_Art.jpg?w=211&amp;ssl=1 211w, https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/250px-Assassins_Creed_2_Box_Art.jpg?w=250&amp;ssl=1 250w" sizes="(max-width: 148px) 100vw, 148px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>This may seem an odd choice considering <a title="Wikipedia - Assassin's Creed Revelations" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin%27s_Creed:_Revelations" target="_blank"><strong>Revelations</strong> </a>came out at the end of last year, but I played <a title="Wikipedia - Assassin's Creed Brotherhood" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin%27s_Creed:_Brotherhood" target="_blank"><strong>Brotherhood</strong> </a>before <a title="Wikipedia - Assassin's Creed II" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin%27s_Creed_II" target="_blank"><strong>AC2</strong> </a>so I had a whole 22 years of story to catch up on before I went on to the newest instalment.  This is another game series I was late getting into, as evidenced by me <em>still</em> not having completed the first game(s), but I enjoy it nonetheless.</p>
<p>The graphics and world design are always fantastic with these games; they build entire cities before your eyes.  The characters are ones that you can invest in; ‘sandboxing’ can be just as fun as the main story; the controls aren&#8217;t always the easiest (on PC) but you can get there in the end.  This game is super fun, and now I&#8217;m clued in on <a title="Wikipedia - Ezio Auditore da Firenze" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezio_Auditore_da_Firenze#Ezio_Auditore_da_Firenze" target="_blank">Ezio’s </a>pre-Brotherhood story I can look forward to <strong>Revelations</strong>.  My only quibble is that there are only so many times I can listen to passers-by shouting <em>“He’ll break something, the idiot!”</em> (or any of their repetitive comments) before I&#8217;ll consider risking desynchronisation just to kill a few civvies.</p>
<h3>Machinarium</h3>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Machinarium-titulka.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="9755" data-permalink="/2012/02/13/gamer-diary-what-ive-been-playing-january-2012/machinarium-titulka/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Machinarium-titulka.jpg?fit=411%2C554&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="411,554" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Machinarium" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Machinarium-titulka.jpg?fit=222%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Machinarium-titulka.jpg?fit=411%2C554&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright  wp-image-9755" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Machinarium-titulka-222x300.jpg?resize=178%2C240" alt="The picture sees a towering city in the background with two main figures in the foreground climbing over a mound of discarded rubbish.

<p>A cute little indie puzzle game, <a title="Wikipedia - Machinarium" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machinarium" target="_blank"><strong>Machinarium</strong> </a>was a little bit of a distraction in between Arkham and AC2 to cleanse the palette of my brain, as it were.  It’s a clever little offering set in a robot city, in which you have to stop some bad robots from killing the King robot and free your girlfriend from the evilbots’ grasps.  Various puzzles and stages lead you all over the city until you finally save the day.  Artistically it’s simple but charming and my only issue was the overused-in-indie trope of saving a damsel in distress.</p>
<h3>Other gaming from January 2012</h3>
<p>Those three are, admittedly, the only three games I have completed, but I&#8217;ve been dipping in and out of others too! <a title="Wikipedia - Serious Sam 3" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serious_Sam_3" target="_blank"><strong>Serious Sam 3: Before First Encounter</strong></a> has so far been good nostalgia-laden fun, but my brain really has been in Open World mode recently and my FPS-ing has suffered as a result. <a title="Wikipedia - Sonic Generations" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_Generations" target="_blank"> <strong>Sonic Generations</strong></a> on PC has also been providing me with some chilled gaming – apart from when I get stuck – as it is bright, colourful and cheery, even in the face of a big baddie who is destroying time.  Finally, not one <em>I</em> have been playing, but <a title="Wikipedia - Skate (video game)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skate_(video_game)" target="_blank"><strong>Skate</strong> </a>on Xbox 360 has been my favourite Let’s-Watch-Someone-Else game as I curl up on the sofa and watch my partner switch nollie heel something-or-other around San Vanelona – it is a good game, but the controls can be a bit pesky for a PC purist, and the complete and total absence of <em>any</em> female boarders is a bit dull.</p>
<h3>Plans for February</h3>
<p>So far, I don’t have any hard-and-fast plans on games; I <em>might </em>revisit <strong>Brotherhood</strong> as I enjoyed AC2 so much (and I lost my <strong>Broho</strong> save game).  I may also stretch to buying <strong>Revelations</strong> as I would like to make sure March is clear for <a title="Youtube - Mass Effect 3 trailer" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENehG1njkEo" target="_blank"><strong>Mass Effect 3</strong></a>.</p>
<p>What has everyone else been playing so far in 2012?</p>
