										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m hoping this&#8217;ll be the start of an all-new series on Bad Reputation, where I delve into a misunderstood, secretive, or just slightly odd subculture. Today, we’re going to start with bronies.</p>
<h2 id="originofspecies">Origin of Species</h2>
<p>Let’s start with a little background.</p>
<p>Once upon a time (1982), in a marketing meeting far, far away (Rhode Island), Hasbro decided to take on the My Little Pony intellectual property. They marketed it pretty much exclusively at girls. The toys were sold with world-shakingly innovative features such as brushable hair and a unique mark on each character’s butt.</p>
<p>The theme continued with a couple of animated series &#8211; in which the ponies partook in such riveting activities as going to school and dating &#8211; and even a feature film. This was pretty standard stuff for Hasbro, who had long since realised the value of getting kids involved with a cartoon. My Little Pony continued on form, with few variations on the core premise, until 2010.</p>
<h2 id="mylittlepony:friendshipismagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</h2>
<p>Everything changed in 2010. Lauren Faust, animator supreme, was roused from her cryogenic slumber. Her mission: to turn a tedious, gender essentialist franchise into something that would break gender boundaries and interest a whole new generation in animated ponies with magical tattoos.</p>
<p>There’s also the horse porn fanart, but we’ll get onto that later.</p>
<p>Faust lists the things that she hopes to achive with MLP:FiM in her <a href="http://msmagazine.com/blog/blog/2010/12/24/my-little-non-homophobic-non-racist-non-smart-shaming-pony-a-rebuttal">Ms. Magazine article about the issue</a>. To quote &#8211;</p>
<blockquote><p>There are lots of different ways to be a girl.</p>
<p>[&#8230;] This show is wonderfully free of “token girl” syndrome, so there is no pressure to shove all the ideals of what we want our daughters to be into one package.</p>
<p>[&#8230;] Cartoons for girls don’t have to be a puddle of smooshy, cutesy-wootsy, goody-two-shoeness. Girls like stories with real conflict; girls are smart enough to understand complex plots; girls aren’t as easily frightened as everyone seems to think. Girls are complex human beings, and they can be brave, strong, kind and independent–but they can also be uncertain, awkward, silly, arrogant or stubborn. They shouldn’t have to succumb to pressure to be perfect.</p>
<p>Yes, My Little Pony is riddled with pink, the leader is a Princess instead of a Queen and there probably aren’t enough boys around to portray a realistic society. These decisions were not entirely up to me. It has been a challenge to balance my personal ideals with my bosses’ needs for toy sales and good ratings. [&#8230;] There is also a need to incorporate fashion play into the show, but only one character is interested in it and she is not a trend follower but a designer who sells her own creations from her own store. We portray her not as a shopaholic but as an artist.</p></blockquote>
<p>Lauren Faust, I think I love you. And, apparently, I’m not the only one. MLP:FiM gained a <em>fucking enormous</em> audience, across all gender identities. For example, let’s take a look at this video.</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/zNryNfvcQlY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p> ;</p>
<p><em>Just fucking look at it.</em></p>
<h2 id="rightgoodsowhatactuallyisabrony">Right, good, so what actually IS a Brony?</h2>
<p>Wikipedia will know, right?</p>
<blockquote><p>Brony is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Krzyżanów, within Kutno County, Łódź Voivodeship, in central Poland. It lies approximately 12 kilometres (7 mi) south of Kutno and 40 km (25 mi) north of the regional capital Łódź.</p></blockquote>
<p>No, probably not. Let’s try Urban Dictionary and ignore anything referring to a sex act or requiring specialist equipment. It might take a while.</p>
<blockquote><p>A name typically given to the male viewers/fans (whether they are straight, gay, bisexual, etc.) of the My Little Pony show or franchise. They typically do not give in to the hype that males aren’t allowed to enjoy things that may be intended for females.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s better. Pretty accurate, too, though I understand that it’s not a gender-specific term (so pay attention to the word ‘typically’ there).</p>
<p>So what do bronies care about? Why are they bronies? I wouldn’t dream of putting uninformed words in their mouths. I went digging for some My Little Pony forums, and put out a little questionnaire via <a href="https://twitter.com/syn/status/215835928499994625">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/comments/vdxv4/im_writing_an_article_about_bronies_its_not_a/">Reddit’s /r/mylittlepony</a>.</p>
<p>I didn’t have much luck finding any insights on the forums, but I found this post very sweet…</p>
<p align="center"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/brony-seeking-question.png"><img loading="lazy" style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="brony-seeking-question" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/brony-seeking-question_thumb.png?resize=590%2C182" alt="brony-seeking-question: screenshot of a forum post asking: have you ever been out in public and found out someone's a brony? did you talk to them about the show? if not, would you like to?'" width="590" height="182" border="0" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>…and this reply absolutely hilarious when taken out of context…</p>
<p align="center"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/brony-seeking-reply.png"><img loading="lazy" style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="brony-seeking-reply" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/brony-seeking-reply_thumb.png?resize=414%2C73" alt="Screenshot reading 'I have seen on many occasions strangers with pony gear on.'" width="414" height="73" border="0" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>…but I digress. I digress pervily, but it’s definitely digression. Let’s move on to the questionnaire.</p>
<h2 id="thebroniesspeak">The Bronies Speak</h2>
<h3 id="whatisyourgenderidentity">“What is your gender identity?”</h3>
<p align="center"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/gender.png"><img loading="lazy" style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="gender" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/gender_thumb.png?resize=365%2C260" alt="bar chart showing gender of respondents: men are in the lead." width="365" height="260" border="0" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>I discovered after putting the questionnaire online that some female MLP fans call themselves “pegasisters”, so there’s potential selection bias in the results. Still, it validates what I was hoping for &#8211; that the majority of responses were coming from the male-identified side of the fandom.<sup><a href="/2012/08/08/adventures-in-subcultures-the-bronies/#footnote_0_11390" id="identifier_0_11390" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" Ed&rsquo;s tiny note: I&rsquo;m wondering how our trans* readers may feel about the way we&rsquo;ve differentiated our categories here. On reflection, it might have been more inclusive to label the &ldquo;male&rdquo; and &ldquo;female&rdquo; categories &ldquo;cis&rdquo;. We did want to avoid any implication that someone who is trans* cannot simply have access to the general terms of &ldquo;male&rdquo; or &ldquo;female&rdquo; &ndash; this is not a view we hold! &ndash; but we may not have succeeded, and it&rsquo;s just as arguable here that we&rsquo;ve done the opposite. Similarly, the question of whether to involve more or fewer &lsquo;categories&rsquo; took some ruminating, and Dave took a while crowdsourcing views on this. In any case, I thought I&rsquo;d say we&rsquo;re always happy to receive feedback for future surveys. ">1</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="wereyouafanofthemylittleponyfranchisebeforefriendshipismagicstarted">“Were you a fan of the My Little Pony franchise before Friendship is Magic started?”</h3>
<p align="center"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/fanbefore.png"><img loading="lazy" style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="fanbefore" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/fanbefore_thumb.png?resize=365%2C170" alt="pie chart with a majority of No answers" width="365" height="170" border="0" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>The community seems to be nearly exclusively focused on the new iteration of My Little Pony, without any pre-existing interest in the older material.</p>
<h3 id="wouldyoubehappyformostorallofthepeopleyouknowtoknowthatyouidentifyasabrony">“Would you be happy for most or all of the people you know to know that you identify as a brony?”</h3>
<p align="center"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/happytobeknown.png"><img loading="lazy" style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="Pie chart with NO at 7 and YES at 12" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/happytobeknown_thumb.png?resize=260%2C124" alt="happytobeknown" width="260" height="124" border="0" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>The number of positive responses to this surprised me. MLP fans get a hard time online, and it can only be worse in meatspace. Perhaps the show’s message of love and tolerance results in a more optimistic viewpoint, or attracts those already predisposed to one.</p>
<h3 id="whatappealstoyouabouttheshowitself">“What appeals to you about the show itself?”</h3>
<blockquote><p>I thoroughly enjoy the idea that a show can be feminine, and ‘made for girls’, without being an overblown, over-prissy tea party. The deconstruction of gender binary and gender stereotypes present in the show is admirable and wonderful.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– anon</em></p>
<blockquote><p>It is refreshing to see a show, even amongst children’s programming, that is completely lacking in cynicism. The show and the characters within it are un-selfconciously idealistic and positive. It provides fantastic role models for children of all genders, and the world it has built feels rich and fully occupied.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– Tim (@trivia_lad)</em></p>
<blockquote><p>The entire show just feels right. When I’m watching MLP:FiM, it’s like I’m a kid again and I can enjoy the childishness of the entire thing without care.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– Shawn X (@shawnyall)</em></p>
<blockquote><p>The character diversity (for once in a children’s show, the fashionable one isn’t the bad guy) and I’m a sucker for the innocent humour included. The characters also have tragic (in the classical sense of the word) flaws: the representative of loyalty is self-centered, the representative of generosity manipulative, and when the representative of Kindness gets mad, even the Hulk would tell her to calm down.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– anon</em></p>
<h3 id="whatdoyoudislikeorresentabouttheshowitself">“What do you dislike or resent about the show itself?”</h3>
<p>The vast majority of responses to this question were “nothing, nada, zero”. It seems the community is generally very happy with the show.</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s a shame Faust had to leave, season 2 was a very different show compared to the first and even though it’s still good something felt like it was missing. I attribute that to Faust’s absence.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– Bret (@the_red_bobcat)</em></p>
<blockquote><p>Although strong, not-even-slightly sexualised female role models are a wonderful thing, I am not wholly comfortable with the representation of male characters in the show. With only one or two exceptions, male ponies are represented as stupid, or comic foils, with roles that tend to be service occupations. Unless an episode requires a stallion MacGuffin (See: a Canterlot Wedding, where you get a male character of high social status, though he is very easily manipulated by a strong, evil female character).</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– MiaVee (@MiaVee)</em></p>
<h3 id="whatareyouparticularlyproudofaboutthebronycommunitywhatdoyouenjoyaboutbeingpartofit">“What are you particularly proud of about the brony community? What do you enjoy about being part of it?”</h3>
<blockquote><p>I’m proud of what we do. We start charities, we raise money, we’re so united and loving. Really, I enjoy the love in the brony community. Everyone is just so understanding, caring, and enjoyable. When I first started watching and putting myself into the community, I didn’t know what to expect. But as I opened up more and more, they accepted me without question. They gave my life an entire new part to enjoy, and changed me forever.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– Shawn X (@shawnyall)</em></p>
<blockquote><p>I particularly enjoy the community’s openness towards almost every type of person (at least this is true for the Reddit section).</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– anon</em></p>
<blockquote><p>I am proud of the grown men who are not ashamed of watching a girls’ show just because it is for girls. I like the “love and tolerate” message and the lack of outright trolls.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– Meghan E</em></p>
<blockquote><p>I think one of the strongest indications of how the brony community aren’t all creepy, socially inept, hygiene-incapable, sexual predators is the eagerness of the producers and actors on the show to engage with them. The Hub ident produced to promote the second series, a reskin of Katy Perry’s “California Girls” called “Equestria Girls” gives a shout out to bronies, Tara Strong on Twitter actively engages with bronies (as does Andrea Libman, to a smaller extent).</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– MiaVee (@MiaVee)</em></p>
<h3 id="whatnegativeexperienceshaveyouhadorknownaboutinthebronycommunitywhatwouldyouchangeifyoucould">“What negative experiences have you had or known about in the brony community? What would you change if you could?”</h3>
<blockquote><p>The only real negative experience that I’ve known about is the discrimination against a sub-section of bronies called ‘cloppers’ &#8211; people who fantasize/look at lewd pictures of characters from the show. The cloppers themselves don’t bother me &#8211; it’s the fact that most of the fandom acts like it’s this skeleton in the closet and are extremely ashamed of it, when really it’s not a big deal.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– Rpspartin (@rpspartin)</em></p>
<blockquote><p><em></em>Anything involving shipping. No no no no no just stop. The show is cute and fine without shoehorning madeup lesbian relationships.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– anon</em></p>
<blockquote><p>The only bad times I’ve seen are all the haters that continue to try to bully us. But I wouldn’t change anything. Some of these people just need a friend and we’re more than happy to be that.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– no name provided</em></p>
<blockquote><p>Having people approach you and say “My Little Pony? Are you an 8 year old girl?” is part of being a brony, but you can live with it because once you tell them to watch the show it’s an amazing feeling to have that same person come back to you and say “Yeah, sorry bro. That show is amazing!”. Anything that’s rock and roll enough for Andrew W.K. (who’s hosting a “What Would Pinkie Pie Do?” talk) is rock and roll enough for me!</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– Bret (@the_red_bobcat)</em></p>
<blockquote><p>There is still a lot of misogyny and ableism. Many bronies seem to think that because it’s good, it can’t possibly be for girls, and thus deny that it’s a girls’ show. Alternatively, many get offended when it’s called a girls’ show because they still equate “girly” with ’bad.“ I’d rather seem them embracing the girliness of it, and responding ”yes, it’s for girls, because girls are awesome. Everything for girls should be this awesome.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– Meghan E.</em></p>
<blockquote><p>I’m reluctant to use the term “brony” to describe myself because in every corner of the internet are snarky non-fans seeking to smear every adult fan of the show [&#8230;] as a fandom overall it seems a lot more welcoming, gentle and understanding than the elitist bullcrap you can get around diehard fangirls and boys for any other show/game/movie.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– MiaVee (@MiaVee)</em></p>
<h3 id="freetexttimetellmewhateveryouthinkthatishouldknow.triviagossipyounameit.thisisyourmoment.">“Free text time! Tell me whatever you think that I should know. Trivia, gossip, you name it. This is your moment.”</h3>
<blockquote><p>The brony community is huge, and rapidly growing. Like any other community of fans, it is impossible to define the composition, interests, and behavior of its members succinctly. I’d ask, gently, that you please keep this in mind while writing your article.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– anon</em></p>
<blockquote><p>I became a slightly more positive and confident person by watching the show.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– anon</em></p>
<blockquote><p>All ponies are equal, but some ponies are more equal than others, including Rarity exclusively.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– DocTavia</em></p>
<blockquote><p>Rarity is best pony. Anyone who says otherwise is just jealous they aren’t as fabulous</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– anon</em></p>
<blockquote><p>The only thing I request is that it be made known that Rarity is easily my favourite.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– Bret (@the_red_bobcat)</em></p>
<h2 id="whatdidwelearn">&#8220;The Derpy Controversy&#8221;</h2>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/derpy.png"><img loading="lazy" style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: right; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="derpy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/derpy_thumb.png?resize=260%2C199" alt="derpy" width="260" height="199" align="right" border="0" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Derpy Hooves is what&#8217;s called a &#8216;background pony&#8217;. She appeared in the crowd in one of the early episodes, and her unusual eyes earned her an instant cult following in the MLP fandom.</p>
<p>Ever attentive to their fans, Lauren Faust and the rest of the team decided to put Derpy in more prominent positions, and even give her a few lines.</p>
<p>This prompted a few equality-minded fans to complain &#8211; &#8216;derpy&#8217; being a <a href="http://genderbitch.tumblr.com/post/1005199855/conclusions-the-word-derp-and-variations">reference</a> to presentations of learning disability. From One Survivor To Another <a href="http://fromonesurvivortoanother.tumblr.com/post/15821397354/trigger-warning-ableism-ableist-slurs-an-open">wrote an open letter to Lauren Faust</a> on the issue, and <a href="http://fromonesurvivortoanother.tumblr.com/post/16423096962/tw-ableism-rape-culture-common-arguments-on-the">followed up with a smackdown</a> to many of the privilege-tastic counter-arguments that were made.</p>
<p>A modified version of the episode featuring Derpy was released on iTunes with &#8216;fixed&#8217; eyes; however, the original version was contained in the DVD release.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to get into the rights and wrongs of this one here &#8211; you can <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/derpy-hooves">read more about Derpy Hooves&#8217; history on Know Your Meme</a> if you like &#8211; but my point is simply that there was discourse in the fandom on the matter. There were strong feelings on both sides, but it&#8217;s nice to know that at least the argument could be conducted (mostly) reasonably.</p>
<h2>What did we learn?</h2>
<p>What, other than the fact that anyone who has expressed a preference wanted to be very vocal about their love for Rarity?</p>
<p>Well, it seems that the MLP fandom are <em>extremely</em> accepting. “Love and tolerance” &#8211; a term so popular that I presume it’s from the show &#8211; is paramount. We’ve seen this before, in communities like furries and otherkin. Don’t get me wrong &#8211; it’s an admirable trait &#8211; but it does lend itself to being accepting of the extremes of the community without significantly challenging them. Deserving or undeserving, that’s something that can get a community a bad name in general.</p>
<p>There is an undeniable degree of childish naïveté in the community. Potentially expected due to the nature of the show, it does seem to result in marginalising those who ‘clop’ or enjoy fanart/fanfic of the characters in adult situations. Controversial one, this, and this is only a personal view &#8211; but I see it as slightly odd but harmless. The fanart and fanfic are drawn and written, and so they don’t harm any real person. If someone wants to pat their flanks to imaginary ponies in compromising scenarios, it doesn’t harm anyone else.</p>
<p>The community seems to revel in the fact that the production team for the show is interested in what they care about, and are willing to name or give cameos to formerly nameless ‘background ponies’ that gain popularity with their fandom.</p>
<p>Bronies &#8211; and the ‘pegasisters’ that I’m sorry to have neglected in the survey &#8211; seem to be, on the whole, genuinely lovely people that just so happen to like cartoon ponies. Is their fandom a bit strange? Sure. That said, though, how many fandoms aren’t?</p>
<p>And now, if you don’t mind, I’m going to watch the first few episodes of the first season. It might be terrible &#8211; it might be great. What I’m fairly certain of, though, is that it’s not going to piss me off.</p>

<li>Which doesn&#8217;t surprise anyone, because <strong>Ils</strong> at <strong>Justsayins</strong> is a martial-artist AND contortionist, and <a href="http://justsayins.tumblr.com/post/14957660366/this-needs-to-stop-and-let-me-tell-you-why"><strong>she can&#8217;t do the poses either</strong></a>. (Her reply post is <a href="http://justsayins.tumblr.com/post/15063906958/its-funny">well worth reading too</a>.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some follow-up links to previous items now, as <strong>Lego</strong>&#8216;s disastrous decision to make <A href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/lego-is-for-girls-12142011.html">pastel-themed and differently-sized Lego just for girls</a> has brought out a whole load of customisation from people who want to give them back an adventuring, building, exciting Lego experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>This <a href="http://superpunch.blogspot.com/2012/01/more-fun-with-lego-for-girls.html"><strong>Badass Retro Aviator</strong></a> by <strong>Nathaniel Brill</strong> made us very happy!</li>
<li>And <a href="http://margotmagowan.wordpress.com/2012/01/04/letter-from-14-yr-old-girl-to-lego/" /><strong>AWESOME 14 year-old Ann Garth</strong></a> wrote to Lego to complain.</li>
<li>We also posted before on <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/09/27/found-feminism-my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic/">the Brony phenomenon</a>, where guys of all ages are becoming fans of <strong>My Little Pony &#8211; Friendship is Magic</strong>, and now <strong>Jonny Sims <a href="http://jonnysopiumden.wordpress.com/2011/12/21/bronies/">suspects he&#8217;s cracked exactly why it&#8217;s happening&#8230;</a></strong></li>
<li>And finally, <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fat-Ladies-Spaaaaace-body-positive-coloring/dp/1463786832">Fat Ladies In Spaaaaace!</strong></a> is the title of a children&#8217;s colouring-book, showing &#8220;<em>Eighteen fat sci-fi heroines doing what they do best: trekking across the time and space, blasting off into adventure, and saving the day.</em>&#8220;</li>

					<description><![CDATA[More Christmas goodiebags from Team BadRep. Vik prescribes a flurry of queens, comics and ... cars! ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More Christmas goodiebags from Team BadRep. All things you could conceivably grab from Waterstones or HMV or Forbidden Planet in time for Christmas! This final round, it&#8217;s Viktoriya&#8217;s turn.</p>

<p>Vik sez:</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I like DVDs, obviously! Also, books and comics and random toys. These are not all from this year, and they&#8217;re not all presents. I tend to get clothes for Christmas! But anyway, in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Agora-DVD-Rachel-Weisz/dp/B003IHV2XQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1324714123&#038;sr=8-1"><strong>Agora</strong></a>: Hypatia writes new mathematical theorems while Alexandria burns. I love Rachel Weisz, and although this film makes me cry a lot, I think it&#8217;s ace.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Pride-Prejudice-Special-Colin-Firth/dp/B001E454FC/ref=sr_1_1?s=dvd&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1324714186&#038;sr=1-1"><strong>Pride and Prejudice</strong></a>: one of my all time favorite books, and this BBC adaptation is the best by far. The new version has all the original colours put back in, which destroyed my impression of Regency England as cloaked in pastels.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Senna-DVD-Ayrton/dp/B004PYD770/ref=sr_1_1?s=dvd&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1324714245&#038;sr=1-1"><strong>Senna</strong></a>: even if you&#8217;re not a fan of F1, I defy anyone to watch this film and not be massively affected by it.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.forbiddenplanet.co.uk/index.php?main_page=index&#038;cPath=388_1316"><strong>The 49ers</strong></a> (Alan Moore): this is my favourite Alan Moore graphic novel. It&#8217;s sort of steampunky, I guess, with cute boy!kissing and prejudice and war and awesome female characters.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Air-Vol-Letters-Lost-Countries/dp/140122153X"><strong>Air</strong></a>(G Willow Wilson): why is this not more well known? Flight attendant Blythe is afraid of flying, but this doesn&#8217;t stop her from a magic realism tour of lands that don&#8217;t exist. Bonus: positive depictions of Islam, Amelia Earhart being awesome beyond words, and things not being quite they seem. A bit like a cross between Angela Carter and Salman Rushdie in graphic novel format.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.forbiddenplanet.co.uk/index.php?main_page=product_music_info&#038;products_id=7328"><strong>Fables</strong></a> (Bill Willingham): If you&#8217;re not reading <strong>Fables</strong>, you need to start. All fairy tales are real, and they&#8217;re living in modern-day New York, waging a war against an enemy known only as the Adversary in their homelands. Snow White is far and away my favourite character, and her relationship with (the big, bad) Bigby Wolf is lovely.</li>
<li><a href="http://hmv.com/hmvweb/displayProductDetails.do?ctx=12;5;81;327;2&#038;sku=564945"><strong>La Reine Margot</strong></a>: my go-to favourite film. The Massacre of Paris, Marguerite de Valois, Catherine de Medici, what more could you ask for? This is a really lush production of a rather <strong>Dynasty</strong>-esque Dumas novel, complete with incest, buckets of blood and lots of poisonings.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Burlesque-Art-Teese-Fetish/dp/0060591676/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1324714996&#038;sr=8-1"><strong>Burlesque and the Art of the Teese</strong></a> (Dita von Teese): lovely coffee table book with lush pictures of Dita. The book is actually split in two: one half is burlesque-focused, and covers the history of burlesque and burlesque outfits through the ages, and other half is focused on fetish-inspired outfits.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.waterstones.com/waterstonesweb/products/edith+thomas/the+women+incendiaries/5792936/"><strong>The Women Incendiaries</strong></a> (Edith Thomas): a recent gift for Yule, this is a history of the female revolutionaries during the French Revolution.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.waterstones.com/waterstonesweb/products/deanna+sclar/auto+repair+for+dummies/4252745/"><strong>Auto Repair for Dummies</strong></a> (Deanna Sclar): well, <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/category/toolbox/secret-diary-of-a-female-petrolhead-toolbox/">obviously</a>. A bit too American in its language, but a decent primer, I think.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Female-Agents-DVD/dp/B001U8WPQ8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1324716977&#038;sr=8-1"><strong>Female Agents</strong></a>: Gah, this film. I don&#8217;t know why it was marketed as <strong>Female Agents</strong> rather than the original <strong>Les Femmes de l&#8217;ombre</strong>. Either way, this is the story of female agents, spies and covert operatives in France during WWII. It&#8217;s gorgeous and sexy and scary, but don&#8217;t expect everyone to live happily ever after.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Marie-Antoinette-DVD-Kirsten-Dunst/dp/B000JU9OKI/ref=sr_1_1?s=dvd&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1324717023&#038;sr=1-1"><strong>Marie Antoinette</strong></a>: on the other end of the spectrum, this is complete fluff. This Sofia Coppola film is light and frilly, like a giant French fancy. It&#8217;s based on <a href="http://www.waterstones.com/waterstonesweb/products/antonia+fraser/marie+antoinette/4624975/">the book by Antonia Fraser</a>, and focuses on Marie Antoinette&#8217;s life up until she flees Versailles. It therefore stops before the horrible execution business happens, and you are also not subjected to Marie Antoinette&#8217;s days in captivity. Instead, you get dresses, frills, cakes, parties, and elaborate hairdos. There is nothing sad or upsetting about this film and I love it like I love cotton candy.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Deathless-Catherynne-M-Valente/dp/0765326310/ref=sr_1_cc_1?s=dvd&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1324717152&#038;sr=1-1-catcorr"><strong>Deathless</strong></a> (Catherynne M Valente): Communism! Fairy tales! The original warrior princess! WIN. (Possibly not as easy to grab via a physical bookstore, but order it for a new year surprise?)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.hasbro.com/mylittlepony/en_GB/"><strong>My Little Pony</strong></a>: I blame <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/09/27/found-feminism-my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic/">Sarah Cook</a> for this.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.nauticalia.com/uk-c/instruments/navigation_and_compasses/index.html"><strong>Compass</strong></a>: Also Sarah Cook&#8217;s fault. She has equipped me with this to assist with navigating my way back, should I ever get lost in strange and exotic foreign locales.</li>
<li><a href="http://uk.hotwheels.com/"><strong>Hot Wheels</strong></a>: no explanation <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/12/15/secret-diary-of-a-female-petrolhead-setting-cars-on-fire-is-the-marshalling-way/">required</a>.&#8221;</li>

					<description><![CDATA[Here's my attempt at a feminist Christmas stocking! Woo!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>HEY READERS. I&#8217;m actually, due to some real life $stuff, staying with my family earlier than planned, meaning that some of the stuff I&#8217;d have photographed for this post I&#8217;ve not been able to, but here&#8217;s my makeshift effort:</p>

<ul>
<ul>
<li>The stocking was made by my mum in timeless 1980s acid brights. Some things basically NEVER go out of fashion, and let me tell you, a turquoise, pink, yellow and orange felt medley is one of those things. Talking of classic, yes, that is an original <a href="http://www.ponylandpress.com/mip/merrytreat.shtml">My Little Pony</a> guarding the stocking.</li>

<ul>
<li>Immediately behind her is a pretty swish-packaged edition of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Ella-Fitzgerald-Sings-Porter-Songbook/dp/B0000047EG"><strong>Ella Fitzgerald Sings The Cole Porter Songbook</strong></a>, which was originally released in 1956 and went into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2000. I love the image of her on the front. She looks like she&#8217;s taking precisely no crap from anybody. In a similar vein, to the left of that we&#8217;ve got <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Essential-Billie-Holiday/dp/B000077JRZ"><strong>The Essential Billie Holiday</strong></a>, which is a three-disc gateway to the sublime.</li>
<li>Jon Klassen&#8217;s <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/childrens-books-site/video/2011/sep/07/hatback-trailer"><strong>I Want My Hat Back</strong></a> was our Markgraf&#8217;s Christmas present to me this year. So beloved of the internet has it become, it has an entry on <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-want-my-hat-back">KnowYourMeme</a>, and I&#8217;m including it because throughout the entire text of the book only one animal is gendered as &#8220;he&#8221; and the rest are up to the reader to gender &#8211; if they need gendering at all. After the <a href="http://maxbarry.com/2011/07/08/news.html">Dogs and Smurfs debate</a>, I reckon that&#8217;s a good thing. It&#8217;s hardly stridently feminist, but it&#8217;s very good at not prescribing anything but a story. The second reason I&#8217;m including it is the general sense of righteous fury in the <a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-sx5r1g7-nk0/TsZ7qDsmVSI/AAAAAAAA6TY/OvfRJ__uJ3o/s640/best_story_book_ever_11.jpg"><em>I HAVE SEEN MY HAT</em> moment</a>. I&#8217;ve had a dozen political click-moments which definitely come under the heading <em>I HAVE SEEN MY HAT.</em> If you get what I mean.</li>
<li>From bears to kangaroos, next to that is <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Tank-Girl-Odyssey-Peter-Milligan/dp/1900097079"><strong>Tank Girl: The Odyssey</strong></a>. I&#8217;m actually (SHOCK) quite new to actually reading TG but <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/08/03/tank-girl-vs-my-enemies/">here&#8217;s Sarah J persuading me.</a></li>
<li>And next to that we&#8217;ve got <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Serious-Concerns-Wendy-Cope/dp/0571167055"><strong>Serious Concerns</strong></a> by poet Wendy Cope, which contains important lines such as <em>Bloody Christmas, here again. / Let us raise a loving cup. / Peace on earth, goodwill to men / And let them do the washing-up.</em> and <em>My cat is dead / But I have decided not to make a big / tragedy out of it</em> &#8211; but also some really touching poems. You can read some of them <a href="http://albalondres.com/2011/04/poems-from-serious-concerns-by-wendy-cope/">here</a> &#8211; I remember <strong>Flowers</strong> and <strong>Defining The Problem</strong> really struck chords with me.</li>
<li>WEIGHTIER TOMES: <a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/books/2010/05/rowbotham-women-dreamers-20th"><strong>Dreamers of a New Day: Women Who Invented the 20th Century</strong></a> by Sheila Rowbotham, which came out this year. And William Golding: not an obvious choice for a feminist blog, perhaps, but <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Double-Tongue-William-Golding/dp/0571178030"><strong>The Double Tongue</strong></a>, his last novel, retrieved in draft form from a drawer and published posthumously, is told entirely from the point of view of the Delphic Oracle, and I loved it. (It&#8217;s much more enjoyable than <strong>Lord of the Flies</strong>.)</li>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Pre-Raphaelite-Women-Artists-Jan-Marsh/dp/0500281041"><strong>Pre-Raphaelite Women Artists</strong></a>: because the Pre-Raphaelite <em>Brother</em>hood was not the <em>whole</em> hood. Tired of women being erased from mainstream art history (for more on which, read <a href="http://womenshistorymonth.wordpress.com/resources/women-and-series/women-and-art/where-are-women-in-the-history-of-art/"> this</a>), Jan Marsh and Pamela Gerrish-Nunn&#8217;s glossy book puts the Sisterhood back on record, with wonderful illustrations.</li>
<li><em>Who&#8217;s Queen?</em> Nurse your Boxing Day hangover with Miranda Richardson&#8217;s finest moments on <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Blackadder-Complete-Collection-Rowan-Atkinson/dp/B000ASALUQ"><strong>Blackadder: The Complete Collection</strong></a>. (I recently rewatched <strong>Blackadder the Third</strong> and apart from her turn as a squirrel-shooting highwaywoman, I also loved Helen Atkinson-Wood&#8217;s supreme comic timing as housekeeper <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mrs_Miggins">Mrs Miggins</a>.</li>
<li>Forgive the big beardy patriarch figure looming in the background, but in these days of strikes and kettles, Karl Marx is looking good on everything. And in the absence of a Rosa Luxemburg shirt, he&#8217;s looking best of all on this tee. LOOK AT HIS FACE. HE IS UNIMPRESSED. Let&#8217;s not have the whole Commodification of Marxism debate now &#8211; the shirt&#8217;s ethically sourced by Fair Wear Foundation (a thing to look out for, or you&#8217;ll defeat the point somewhat) and you can purchase one from <a href="http://savagelondon.com/"><strong>Savage London</strong></a> who have a shop in London&#8217;s Covent Garden. And you could do worse than wrap it around Terry Eagleton&#8217;s latest book on the topic, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Why-Marx-Right-Terry-Eagleton/dp/0300169434"><strong>Why Marx Was Right</strong></a>, an accessible and funny primer for lefty political activists of any stripe (and much easier to read with aforementioned Yule Hangover than <strong>Das Kapital</strong>, eh).</li>
<li>Oh, and TEA. Everybody needs tea. Twinings are doing some cute tins which I kind of wanted to graffiti when I saw them in the shop with &#8220;Psst! Riots, not diets!&#8221; and &#8220;Priscilla! Are we fair trade, do you know?&#8221; so the ladies could chat to each other. But otherwise, any tea will do.</li>

<p>After spending a while bemoaning the absence of <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/03/24/avatar-the-legend-of-korra-gets-badass-on-gender-expectations/">Cool Cartoons For Girls That Aren&#8217;t Avatar Legend of Korra</a>, I went home for the weekend to be reunited with my <strong>My Little Pony</strong> collection when my Dad and I cleaned out the garage.</p>
<p>This then spurred me on to sit down and watch the new series, more in hope than expectation.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqgsXkmQ6ZI">My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, Episode One clip on YouTube</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.hubworld.com/my-little-pony/shows/friendship-is-magic">Official site for the show</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Well, that was brilliant, wasn&#8217;t it? Funny, well animated, lots of female (pony-shaped) characters &#8211; which interestingly sidesteps that all-animals-are-male <a href="http://maxbarry.com/2011/07/08/news.html">problem</a>. Then came feverish research &#8211; where did this awesome thing come from? Well, let me tell you. It was created by <a href="http://fyre-flye.deviantart.com/"><strong>Lauren Faust</strong></a>, she of<a href="http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/tv_shows/ppg/index.html"><strong>Powerpuff Girls</strong></a> fame, and intended to be just as wisecrackingly cross-generational as those three super powered big eyed girls. <strong>MLPFIM</strong> is a strong candidate for being a Found Feminism on content and provenance alone.</p>

Seriously guys, you are my new heroes, swatting aside all kinds of gender conventions in a mighty leap of Being Able To Like What You Damn Well Please. *round of applause*</p>
<p>My personal favourite of the new batch of ponies are <a href="http://www.hasbro.com/en_GB/shop/details.cfm?guid=66F93B01-19B9-F369-10D3-9C9894F2502F&amp;product_id=26131&amp;src=endeca">Scootaloo</a>, who likes sports and lives in a treehouse, and <a href="http://www.hasbro.com/en_GB/shop/details.cfm?guid=BE189416-5056-900B-107C-443B1B0E51FC&amp;product_id=27959&amp;src=endeca">Twilght Sparkle</a> who is telekenetic, serious, bookish, has a pet dragon and owns her own steampunk zeppelin that doubles as a nightlight. I am not joking. I may have to buy one.</p>
