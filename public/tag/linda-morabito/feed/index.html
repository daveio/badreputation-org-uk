										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The wonderful website <a href="http://www.lettersofnote.com"><strong>Letters of Note</strong></a> is always worth reading (or <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/LettersOfNote">following on twitter</a>), and recently they posted a letter which made me reflect on how far we&#8217;ve come in a few decades.</p>
<p>Astronomer and physicist <a href="http://www.lettersofnote.com/2011/03/if-membership-is-restricted-to-men-loss.html">Carl Sagan wrote in 1981 to an organisation called &#8220;The Explorers Club&#8221;.</a> Some history is needed here: this was a group founded in 1905 in New York, as a club for those who pursue &#8220;Scientific Exploration&#8221; (including both Explorers and Scientists). A letterhead he mentions in the note says <em>To the conquest of the unknown and the advancement of knowledge.</em> Back around 1900, the idea that women could be part of either of those professions or join the club wasn&#8217;t considered. The club then remained men-only for decades in the name of tradition.</p>
<p>Sagan was adding his voice to others in the early 1980s asking that women should be allowed to be members. His letter is polite, but one middle paragraph is a brilliant list of women who have contributed to the pursuit of new knowledge:</p>
<blockquote><p>There are several women astronauts. The earliest footprints &#8212; 3.6 million years old &#8212; made by a member of the human family have been found in a volcanic ash flow in Tanzania by <strong>Mary Leakey</strong>. Trailblazing studies of the behavior of primates in the wild have been performed by dozens of young women, each spending years with a different primate species. <strong>Jane Goodall</strong>&#8216;s studies of the chimpanzee are the best known of the investigations which illuminate human origins. The undersea depth record is held by <strong>Sylvia Earle</strong> [pictured below]. The solar wind was first measured in situ by <strong>Marcia Neugebauer</strong>, using the Mariner 2 spacecraft. The first active volcanoes beyond the Earth were discovered on the Jovian moon Io by <strong>Linda Morabito</strong>, using the Voyager 1 spacecraft. These examples of modern exploration and discovery could be multiplied a hundredfold.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.explorers.org/index.php">The Explorers Club</a> changed their policy later that year, and now do not restrict based on gender.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not the part which gives me hope.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/earle.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="8500" data-permalink="/2011/11/17/a-snapshot-of-the-past/earle/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/earle.jpg?fit=800%2C525&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="800,525" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="earle" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/earle.jpg?fit=300%2C196&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/earle.jpg?fit=800%2C525&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/earle-300x196.jpg?resize=300%2C196" alt="Photo of a Caucasian woman (Sylvia Earle) in a snorkel mask and red diving suit showing something to another white woman who is inside what appears to be a diving bell or behind a glass screen.

He&#8217;s genuinely trying to convince the Club, using facts and appealing to logic, that they should make this change. There&#8217;s no hint of anger or appeal to fairness. He doesn&#8217;t say women deserve equality, and only calmly points out that if you want a &#8216;social club for the boys&#8217; you shouldn&#8217;t claim to represent all scientists and explorers in 1981. In fact he (as a member) acts as though they could have every right to exclude women because of tradition, but that they&#8217;re mistaken and women should in fact qualify under their own rules. (I&#8217;m not saying Sagan wasn&#8217;t passionate about equality, at all &#8211; his belief in it comes through clearly in many of his books and documentaries, and he&#8217;s an absolute hero. I think he was being deliberately polite.)</p>
<p>However, I expect that someone writing to the Explorers Club today might send a very different message. A message which includes the questions &#8220;What do you think you&#8217;re doing?&#8221; and &#8220;Why are you being so incredibly blinkered?&#8221;. I can well believe that there was prejudice against the quality of women&#8217;s roles in science in 1981: there&#8217;s prejudice <em>now</em>. But I think the average expectation of what is normal and fair has genuinely shifted, to the point that Sagan&#8217;s letter reads as quite oddly passive today.</p>
<p>In the week when Google <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/nov/07/marie-curie-birth-google-doodle?newsfeed=true">celebrated Marie Curie&#8217;s 144th birthday</a>, I enjoy anything which reminds us that we need to <a href="http://xkcd.com/896/">move away from the token lady scientist</a> when looking at women&#8217;s roles in the discovery of new frontiers. This letter is, I hope, an anachronism today. I also dearly hope it won&#8217;t seem normal again in the future.</p>
