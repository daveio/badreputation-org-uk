<p>What <em>do</em> you call a female astronaut? These are some of the ingenious words that journalists invented in the early 1960s to avoid having to say ‘astronaut’ when describing <strong>Jerrie Cobb</strong>, the first woman to pass NASA tests and qualify as an astronaut, although she never had a chance to go into space.</p>
<p>I’ve been thinking about astronauts recently for two reasons. Firstly, a friend of mine lent me this <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bT8HU-BpiwkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank">absorbing book</a> about the ‘Mercury 13′ – women including Cobb who were trained as astronauts but never went into space because America wasn’t brave enough.</p>
<p>Secondly, I discovered a pile of my old school reports in my mum’s flat the other day and was astonished to read that my stated career ambition at age 11 was ‘astronaut’. I mean, I loved space and stars and rockets – are there any kids that don’t? And I do remember wanting to be an astronaut. But at 11? It makes me wonder how old I was when I gave up wanting to be a knight of the round table&#8230;</p>
<h2>A dream for boys?</h2>
<p>I’m not going to rant about how being an astronaut shouldn’t be a distant dream for a girl. Let’s face it, astronauting isn’t an easy line to get into &#8211; it’s a distant dream for most people. Apparently there have been 512 humans in space, of which 10% have been women (<a title="Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_space_travelers_by_name" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>  has a list of space travellers.) Unimpressive, I agree, but when you bear in mind that we can scarcely get women into the House of Commons (around 20% of MPs are women) getting them into space seems like less of a priority.</p>
<p>What really interests me is that women into space doesn’t really go even <em>as a dream</em>. Of course, there’s been an <a title="Astronaut Barbie" href="http://www.fashion-doll-guide.com/Vintage-Barbie-Miss-Astronaut.html" target="_blank">astronaut Barbie</a>, but the gender stereotypes that so confused journalists back then are still very much in evidence in the aisles of toy shops today, as <a title="Sociological Images" href="http://contexts.org/socimages/2010/03/20/the-princess-and-the-astronaut/comment-page-1/" target="_blank">this post on Sociological Images</a> neatly shows. Being an astronaut is a childhood dream for boys only.</p>
<h2>A dream for men?</h2>
<p>In fact, even in adult culture it seems we’re not totally <em>cool</em> with the dream of female astronauts. Here’s a brief, interesting <a title="Times Higher Ed" href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=166342&amp;sectioncode=26" target="_blank">article</a>  by Marie Lathers from Times Higher Ed about women astronauts in films, which takes in <strong>Alien</strong>, <strong>Contact</strong>, <strong>Apollo 13</strong> and even <strong>I Dream of Jeannie</strong> (astronaut husband).</p>
<p>Lathers sees an identification of the feminine with mother earth and nature, setting them in opposition to space and even to science. Given this conflict she suggests that women in space are more frequently aligned with the alien (our old friend the Other) than with the human space adventurer. She sez:</p>
<blockquote><p>Popular culture representations of women in space reveal a need to “ground” women by keeping them bound to Earth. Woman grounded is woman subjected to the weight of gravity; bodies in space defy gravity. Feminist theory needs to assess the possibilities that rethinking women in space affords. “Extraterrestrial” feminism may provide a way out of the essentialism that bottles us up.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s an interesting notion, and one that the arts student in me would like to pursue. However, I wanted to talk about some of the real female astronauts as well as the dream. I’ll just give a few examples from their stories &#8211; I couldn’t bear to pick just one of these incredible women.</p>
<h2>‘A woman’s place is in the cockpit’</h2>
<p>I mentioned poor Jerrie Cobb and the <a title="NASA" href="http://history.nasa.gov/printFriendly/flats.html" target="_blank">Mercury 13</a>  who so narrowly missed being the first ‘feminauts’. Another fascinating woman is linked to the US Women in Space Program. Without beautician-turned-aviator <a title="Bad Reputation - Jackie Cochran" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/03/10/unsung-heroes-jackie-cochran/" target="_blank"><strong>Jackie Cochran</strong></a> – who held more speed, altitude and distance records than any other pilot in aviation history at the time of her death in 1980 – it may never have happened at all. Check out <a title="Right Stuff Wrong Sex" href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bT8HU-BpiwkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=right+stuff+wrong+sex&amp;ei=2UKpS-7LOYGuyAT0nYn4DQ&amp;cd=1%22%20%5Cl%20%22=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false" target="_blank">Right Stuff Wrong Sex</a>  for the story of a serious political operator at work.</p>
<p>Russian <a title="Astronautix" href="http://www.astronautix.com/astros/terhkova.htm" target="_blank"><strong>Valentina Tereshkova</strong></a> made it to first woman in space, in 1963 (beating the US by an appalling TWENTY YEARS) and launched skywards from a suitably proletarian background – she was a textile factory worker and an amateur parachutist who left school at 8 and continued her education through correspondence courses. She spent three days in space, and went round the earth 48 times.</p>
<p>Physicist <a title="Dr Sally Ride" href="http://www.astronautix.com/astros/ride.htm" target="_blank"><strong>Dr Sally Ride</strong></a> was the first American woman in space, in 1983, and one of our own (feminists, that is). Ride reportedly:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230; refused to be seen in television downlinks doing food preparation or toilet cleaning, even though these were shared crew responsibilities. She refused to accept a bouquet of flowers from NASA after completing her first space mission. She pasted a bumper sticker to the front of her desk: “A woman’s place is in the cockpit”.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ride went on to found science education organisation <a title="Sally Ride Science" href="http://www.sallyridescience.com" target="_blank">Sally Ride Science</a>, which pleasingly promises to be “all science, all the time” and encourages girls to learn about and enjoy science and maths.</p>
<p>In 1992 scientist, doctor and peace worker <a title="Bad Reputation - Mae Jemison" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/08/02/unsung-heroes-mae-jemison/" target="_blank"><strong>Dr Mae Jemison</strong></a> became the first woman of colour in space. After her retirement from NASA, Jemison has led work supporting research into the use of technology in developing countries and science education for teenagers. AND she wins pop culture points by being the first real life astronaut to appear on <strong>Star Trek</strong>. Which is especially neat as she said that Lieutenant Uhura (played by Nichelle Nichols) was one of her early heroes. Look at this <a title="The MarySue Tumblr" href="http://themarysue.tumblr.com/post/41112110478/spockanduhura-oh-thats-just-the-first-black" target="_blank">awesome picture</a> of them together.</p>
<h2>Women to look up to</h2>
<p>I think it’s particularly because I’m not from a tech or science background that female astronauts are like superheroes to me. That’s why I love this <a title="Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/planetbond/sets/72157612379863486/" target="_blank">Flickr set</a> of loosely inspired portraits Philip Bond has done. Obviously they’ve lovely things in themselves, but I like them because they look like collectible playing cards, or stickers. I want Tereshkova on a t-shirt. I want people to ask me who she is so I can tell them.</p>

<p>You know when I said earlier that getting women into space wasn’t really a priority? Not compared to getting women into Parliament, for example. Well, in a way that’s not true. It’s all a priority. Because real life role models give you the permission to have the dream.</p>
<p>Every girl who dreams of being an astronaut won’t become one. But she may become an engineer, or a physicist, a mathematician, a pilot, an athlete. She might teach science to other girls. She may be a leader.</p>
<p>There are exceptional individuals who blaze a trail, like the women above. But I think I can safely speak for most of us when I say it’s nice to have someone to look up to.</p>
<p>Why was I so keen on being an astronaut? I think it was as much to do with <a title="Wikipedia - Helen Sharman" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Sharman" target="_blank"><strong>Helen Sharman</strong></a>, who became the first British person in space when I was 8, as it was to do with my love of stars.</p>
<p>You’ve probably deduced that I didn’t become an astronaut. But I did become a feminist, and it’s women like these that inspire me.</p>
