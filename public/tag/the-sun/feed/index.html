					<description><![CDATA[Page 3's been the horsefly on the cowpat of the Sun newspaper for years. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Page 3, revered by its supporters as &#8216;a British institution&#8217; and pushed by its owners as &#8217;empowering&#8217;, has been the horsefly on the cowpat of the Sun newspaper for years. In my early teens, pre-Internet, a glimpse of tit from a discarded copy of the Sun was my first vision of a naked breast. I&#8217;m also fairly sure it was the exact moment that I decided that mainstream, unimaginative, plastic-and-makeup porn wasn&#8217;t for me, but I digress.</p>
<p>Other people have made better arguments (<a title="The Sun's Page 3 is the highly visible tip of misogyny's iceberg" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/sep/14/sun-page-3-visible-tip-misogynys-iceberg" target="_blank">here&#8217;s one</a>, and <a title="Could this campaign to stop Page 3 succeed?" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/shortcuts/2012/sep/11/campaign-stop-page-3-succeed" target="_blank">here&#8217;s another</a>) than I could for why having a teenager with her tits out in the first few pages of a national newspaper might not be a particularly stellar idea. It&#8217;s objectification at its worst, and the empowerment argument neglects the fact that there are better, safer, and more rewarding ways to take your clothes off for financial gain if that&#8217;s what you truly want to do.</p>
<p>My argument against Page 3 is quite simple; if you don&#8217;t want to reject it simply because it&#8217;s in bad taste, insensitive, and chauvinistic, then reject it because it uses psychological techniques to manipulate your views into agreeing with whatever fits the Sun&#8217;s goals at the time. The Sun sees its readership not just as customers, but as bargaining chips and weapons.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a quick look at a few examples of Page 3. The rather excellent <a title="Tim Ireland" href="http://www.bloggerheads.com/business/" target="_blank">Tim Ireland</a> over at <a title="Bloggerheads" href="http://bloggerheads.com" target="_blank">Bloggerheads</a>, nemesis of Nadine Dorries, has been collecting these &#8211;  I hope he won’t mind me mirroring them here. Credit due entirely to him and anyone who might have scanned them for him.</p>

<p>Now, it&#8217;s quite possible that these women hold these opinions. It&#8217;s quite interesting, however, that they coincide with the vitriol that appears in the <em>The Sun Says</em> portion of the paper, home of a much more blatant attempt to tell their readership what to think.</p>
<p>Think about this, though &#8211; what if these statements are invented by the paper? Then, what we have on our hands is a cheap attempt to use <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14674817/" target="_blank">the many cognitive biases that sexual attraction brings into play</a> to form an opinion in the undecided. This person is attractive; you&#8217;re naturally more inclined to agree with people that you find attractive; your opinion is swayed. All the time, you&#8217;re seeing it as just a bit of fun, just a silly piece of paper with a pair of breasts. Every day, this message hits home. Over time, it affects people &#8211; they think the way the Sun, and thus the Murdoch empire, wants them to think.</p>
<p>Yes, alright, I&#8217;ve strayed a bit into tin-foil-hat territory. The fact is, though, that this is having an effect on the Sun&#8217;s readership. How big an effect is arguable, of course, but it&#8217;s non-zero. Also, don&#8217;t forget that there&#8217;s a huge line on the role of these women &#8211; they&#8217;re being used as tools, to have opinions thrust into their mouths. Even the names are probably pseudonyms. They are there for no reason <em>at all</em> other than to be a pair of tits, and that shit is just not on.</p>
<p>If you won&#8217;t boycott the Sun because you hate the exploitation and objectification of women that it represents, boycott it because you value your own power of self-determination.</p>
