					<description><![CDATA[If you remember the Alphabet of Feminism, this one's for you. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Ed&#8217;s note:</strong> In the original Alphabet we did <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/10/18/an-alphabet-of-femininism-3-c-is-for-crinoline/" target="_blank">&#8216;C is for Crinoline&#8217;</a> &#8211; but here&#8217;s something we thought was topically worth coming back to.</p>
<h6 style="text-align: center;">C</h6>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">CHIVALRY</h2>
<blockquote><p>Chivalry is dead, but you&#8217;re still kinda cute.</p>
<p>&#8211; Nelly Furtado, <strong>Promiscuous</strong> (2006)</p></blockquote>
<p>Chivalry. Not one of feminism&#8217;s most pressing issues, but definitely one of its more genteel <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/01/25/keep-the-gift-pay-what-you-owe/" target="_blank">debates</a>.</p>
<p>Do you, as an attractive female who also happens to be a feminist, deign to take the seat that dude offers you on the crowded tube or laugh hollowly and stick your head back in your neighbour&#8217;s armpit? Is chivalry OK?</p>
<p>Personally, my view on this debate is always affected by the point that 99% of the men I&#8217;ve met who talk about chivalry with misty-eyed fervour are also the kind of Nice Guys who Really Aren&#8217;t Very Nice At All.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not for here.</p>
<p>What I am interested in is looking at its complex linguistic heritage.</p>
<h2>Horses</h2>
<p>What&#8217;s that sound in the distance?</p>
<p>Why, it&#8217;s the sound of clopping hooves &#8211; and<em> chivalry</em>&#8216;s etymological root come to join us. Neiiigh.</p>

<p>For though <em>chivalry<strong> </strong></em>in English means (first definition ahoy!)  &#8216;the code of behaviour demonstrated<em> by a perfect knight</em>&#8216;, were we French we&#8217;d replace &#8216;knight&#8217; with &#8216;<em>chevalier</em>&#8216;, or &#8216;horseman&#8217; &#8211; from the root word <em>cheval</em> (= &#8216;horse&#8217;).</p>
<p>The knight, or <em>chevalier</em>, is <em> </em>in origin a nobleman on horseback who goes around rescuing maidens and fighting dragons. He is <em>chivalrous </em>in behaviour, displaying (the word&#8217;s second definition) &#8216;courage, honour, justice and readiness to help the weak&#8217;.</p>
<p>Key examples can be found in the legends of King Arthur and his horsebacked Knights of the Round Table &#8211; in particular Sir Gawain and the so-good-he-couldn&#8217;t-be-gooder Sir Percival (who later becomes Wagner&#8217;s <strong>Parsifal</strong>).</p>
<p>The chivalrous are those on horseback.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s the secondary meaning of <em>chivalry</em> that we best recognise today: &#8216;<em>courteous</em> behaviour, especially towards women&#8217; (that is, giving up your seat on the tube, which Percival would totally have done if he didn&#8217;t travel everywhere by <em>cheval</em>).<em> </em></p>
<h2>Courtly-powered lovin&#8217;</h2>
<p>Chivalry &#8211; and the <em>courtesy </em>that defines it &#8211; is also the base idea behind <em>courtly</em> <em>love</em>, which the devoted may remember we addressed separately in the <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/12/20/an-alphabet-of-femininism-12-l-is-for-lady/" target="_blank">Alphabet Glory Days</a>.</p>

<p>This is what the knights are doing when they&#8217;re not out fighting &#8211;  sighing for love among rose bushes, swooning at the touch of a <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/11/01/an-alphabet-of-femininism-5-e-is-for-emancipate/" target="_blank">&#8216;lily-white hand&#8217;</a> and <em>definitely </em>giving up their seats for a woman on the medieval commute.</p>
<p>And it was said to have been invented by a woman, Eleanor of Aquitaine.</p>
<p>Before she married Henry II and brought her French customs over to England, Eleanor had a period presiding alone over a predominantly male grouping in Poitiers.It seems inventing an elaborate code of chaste devotion to a single lady &#8211; <em>court</em>eous behaviour, if you will &#8211; was a good way for Eleanor to bring these bored and potentially restless knights into order &#8211; and, I assume, to block potential sexual aggression at the same time (cf. the court of Elizabeth I, which saw a resurgence of &#8216;courtly&#8217; devotion to &#8216;Gloriana&#8217;, the &#8216;Virgin <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/02/07/an-alphabet-of-femininism-17-q-is-for-queen/" target="_blank">Queen</a>&#8216;).</p>
<h2>Courtship</h2>
<p>With these courtly roots, it&#8217;s appropriate that, during the English Civil War, the word <em>chevalier </em>should lend itself so enthusiastically to the Royalist cause in fighting for king (and court).</p>
<p>In this context, the Cavaliers were enemies to the Roundheads and cousins to <em>chevaliers</em> via the Latin source-word &#8216;cabellarius&#8217; (also meaning &#8216;horseman&#8217;).</p>
<p>The origin of this term is actually pre-war, in the grouping of courtly &#8216;cavaliers&#8217; at the original Carolingian court (a bit like the courtly lovers at Poitiers).</p>
<p>These included the &#8216;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavalier_poet" target="_blank">Cavalier poets</a>&#8216;, a conglomerate of literary courtiers formed by the King himself, including Robert Herrick and Edmund Waller.</p>
<p>The term in this usage is ambiguous, though. On the one hand, <em>cavalier</em> was often used in allusion to the King&#8217;s refined (indeed &#8216;knightly&#8217;) sensibilities, which, incidentally, included a famous love of horses &#8211; as the many magnificent equestrian portraits of him attest.</p>
<p>But, in a pejorative sense, the <em>cavalier poets </em>were so named because they were famously &#8216;roistering gallants&#8217; and &#8216;libertines&#8217;. This is <em>cavalier</em>&#8216;s other meaning: &#8216;haughty, disdainful or supercilious&#8217; or &#8216;offhand and unceremonious&#8217; (a bit like wearing your hat at a<a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/02/14/an-alphabet-of-femininism-18-r-is-for-rake/" target="_blank"> &#8216;rakish&#8217; angle</a>).</p>
<p>So <em>cavalier </em>is almost a contraction in terms.</p>
<h2>The Don</h2>
<p>This is the very ambiguity we find in Mozart&#8217;s great libertine opera, <strong>Don Giovanni</strong>, written about 100 years later. The &#8216;Don&#8217; is a nobleman and serial womaniser. He&#8217;s a standard-issue<a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/02/14/an-alphabet-of-femininism-18-r-is-for-rake/" target="_blank"> rake</a>, in fact: we learn in the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fccdGBi9JUs&amp;t=2m30s" target="_blank">Catalogue Song</a> that he&#8217;s seduced 1,003 women in Spain alone.</p>

<p>He is throughout referred to in the Italian as a &#8216;cavalier&#8217;, understood (and, for us English-speakers, translated) according to context variously as &#8216;gentleman&#8217; (nobleman on horseback) and &#8216;rake&#8217; (careless womaniser) &#8211; as in the opera&#8217;s subtitle, &#8216;Il <em>dissoluto</em> punito&#8217; (&#8216;the debauchee punished&#8217;).</p>
<p>Thus, when Don Giovanni takes the pretty peasant girl Zerlina away from her finance, Masetto, to show her his castle (no, really), Don Giovanni &#8216;reassures&#8217; the jealous Masetto by saying he needn&#8217;t worry &#8211; his fiancee is &#8216;in the hands of a <em>cavalier</em>&#8216;.Unfortunately, that&#8217;s exactly what Masetto is afraid of. &#8220;Let the<em> cavaliere </em>make a <em>cavaliera</em> out of you!&#8221; he trumpets at the departing Zerlina &#8211; he knows what&#8217;s going down (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q40a23gfxZE" target="_blank">this</a>).</p>
<h2>Court to City</h2>
<p>Back to English climes.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the eighteenth century, Queen Anne halved the size of the English court and moved it out of central London.</p>
<p>In so doing, she ultimately ended up transferring power from court to city &#8211; and <em>courtesy </em>became <em></em>civility (from the Latin <em>cives</em> (= the city)).</p>

<p>This is the age of opening doors, watching your language and standing up when a woman enters the room. Chivalry has gone domestic; men are <em>civil </em>now in Britain. Only the hot-headed Italian Don Giovannis are still <em>cavaliers</em>.</p>
<p>But when Samuel Richardson wanted to depict a perfect (but domestic) Englishman, he still made him an aristocratic knight (<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sir</span> Charles Grandison</strong>). Jane Austen did too: her paragon of virtue (himself based on Sir Charles), is pointedly named Mr <em>Knightly</em> (<strong>Emma</strong>).By this point it&#8217;s faded away to a name rather than a title, but the gentleman still has a vestigial horse (if you will).</p>
<h2>White Knights</h2>
<p>Strangely enough, the vestigial horse becomes more literal in the modern age, in the form of the ladies&#8217; proverbial &#8216;ideal man&#8217; &#8211; a chivalrous gentleman. Mr Right is also a &#8216;knight in shining armour&#8217;.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s even a  Lewis Carroll-esque &#8216;White Knight&#8217;, a noble rescuer (as in the song &#8216;My White Knight&#8217; from Meredith Wilson&#8217;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_oyzwsJOhU" target="_blank"><strong>The Music Man</strong></a>, where the knight in question will, her mother thinks, &#8216;save&#8217; Marian the Librarian from Old Maidery).</p>
<p>Remember when Grace first meets Leo &#8211; the Great Romance &#8211; in <strong>Will and Grace</strong>? He&#8217;s on a horse in Central Park. That&#8217;s how you know he&#8217;s a Big Deal Romance.</p>
<h2>Never trust a man on horseback</h2>
<p>And, to conclude very crudely, I suppose this is what happened to <em>chivalry </em>.</p>
<p>It became the polite behaviour of the  gentleman &#8211; enshrined in tradition and developed over a couple of hundred years to become our friend offering me a seat on the bustling 21st century commute<strong> </strong>and sitcom single girls dreaming of their &#8216;Mr Darcy&#8217;.</p>
<p>But I still hear the sound of clopping hooves. The fantasy may be more Sir Gawain than Don Giovanni, but you know what they say &#8211; the apple never falls far from the lexical tree.</p>

<p>She has a dizzying list of titles to her name, of which I managed to snatch only a portion: most people have heard of <strong>Ballet Shoes</strong>, and, for many, it was a defining childhood book. It&#8217;s a critics&#8217; and writers&#8217; pet: (Dame) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacqueline_Wilson">Jacqueline Wilson</a> cites it as her &#8220;all-time favourite children&#8217;s book&#8221;, and the BBC has twice adapted it for television. Lots of people also know about the other &#8216;Shoes&#8217; books: <strong>Dancing Shoes</strong>, <strong>White Boots</strong>, <strong>Tennis Shoes</strong>, <strong>Ballet Shoes for Anna</strong> and the Carnegie award-winning <strong>The Circus Is Coming</strong>, but maybe less are familiar with <strong>The Children of Primrose Lane, Party Shoes, </strong>the <strong>Gemma </strong>books, or <strong>Caldicott Place</strong>. Certainly, her considerable output of books for adults has largely gone unnoticed (one of which formed the basis for <strong>Ballet Shoes </strong>itself) and I myself have only read one: <strong>Saplings</strong>, an experimental novel that explores contemporary thought about child psychology in the aftermath of war. Somewhat disturbingly, it is still written from Streatfeild&#8217;s distinctive &#8216;child&#8217;s-eye-view&#8217;, from which vantage point it addresses issues as varied as depression, alcoholism, sex, bed-wetting, bereavement and female self-esteem (not all at once, of course).</p>

<p>It has been often commented that Streatfeild&#8217;s gift is her ability to establish a rapport with her reader: she never talks down to children, and deals with difficult topics in the same way she describes everyday occurrences. Her commitment to realism in writing extends to her habit of painstakingly explaining what all the characters are thinking at all times. Thus, in <strong>Dancing Shoes</strong>, the just-orphaned Rachel is considered unloving and aggressive because she took her mother&#8217;s death with equanimity: we the readers, on the other hand, are kept aware of Rachel&#8217;s trials &#8211; how she scowls to keep from crying and wants to avoid any questions that might set her off. The child-reader is nevertheless forced to see the situation from at least two perspectives simultaneously, a common approach to Literature since Samuel Richardson, but amazingly innovative in writing for children. The result is a style that demands a responsibility from its readers as well as understanding: it accepts that life is often unfair, but invites children to consider how best to respond.</p>
<p>Streatfeild was famously the &#8216;unattractive&#8217; middle girl in a clergyman&#8217;s family of three daughters. After the &#8216;beautiful child&#8217; tradition of nineteenth-century children&#8217;s literature (best represented by <strong>Frances Hodgson Burnett</strong> and <strong>Lewis Carroll</strong>), her novels frequently focus on the rebellious, the stubborn and the plain, than which no better example exists than the &#8216;black-doggish&#8217; Jane Winter in <strong>The Painted Garden</strong>, which meta-fictionally reworks Hodgson Burnett&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_Garden">most famous novel</a> on a film set in Hollywood. In the absence of naive beauty and idyllic country settings, her characters must make their way on merit, and, not only plain, they are often money-minded to a startling degree: &#8220;The law lets me work; I don&#8217;t need a licence, and I can do what I like with my own money,&#8221; asserts Pauline, in <strong>Ballet Shoes</strong>, at fourteen (and she gets her way).</p>

<p>The central conceit of this novel<strong> </strong>&#8211; the absence of Great Uncle Matthew (&#8220;Gum&#8221;), who adopts the three &#8216;Fossils&#8217; and then dashes off to &#8220;some strange islands&#8221; &#8211; means that the book features an essentially all-female cast. Aside from the Fossils themselves &#8211; Pauline, Petrova and Posy &#8211; the house in Cromwell Road also contains Sylvia, the children&#8217;s guardian (&#8220;Garnie&#8221;); Nana, a no-nonsense disciplinarian; Theo Dane, a dancing teacher at the Children&#8217;s Academy of Dancing and Stage Training, and Dr Smith and Dr Jakes, doctors of Maths and English respectively. These last two later move on to &#8220;a charming flat in Bloomsbury&#8221; and although aged seven I never thought to ask why two female doctors should have to live together, now I wonder if Streatfeild has not rather audaciously put a lesbian couple in a 1930s kids&#8217; book (there are some rumours about the nature of the friendships she shared with women herself, and she has been claimed variously for a lesbian and an asexual). Certainly the illustration of the Doctors by Ruth Gervis suggests she saw it that way, even if Streatfeild may not have done: they are depicted in a stereotypical style that has barely changed since the novel was written in 1936.</p>
<p>The only man in sight, apart from the absent Gum, is Mr Simpson, a border who teaches Petrova all about cars and then must go back to his &#8216;rubber trees&#8217; in Kuala Lumpur. And while Pauline and Posy have looks and interests to endear them to the most pink and fluffy reader going, Petrova remains as stubbornly boyish as that perennially scruffy heroine of female fiction, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Women"><strong>Little Women</strong></a>&#8216;s Jo: when the dancing school plan is first mentioned, Nana hopes it will &#8220;turn her more like a little lady&#8221; &#8211; Petrova &#8220;never plays with dolls, and takes no more interest in her clothes than a scarecrow&#8221;.</p>
<p>Alas for Nana, Petrova ends up spending auditions &#8220;flying an imaginary airplane on a new route to China&#8221;, and by the end of the book, is a determined aviator: &#8220;Amy Mollison and Jean Batten will be [in the history books], but not as important at you&#8221;, promises Pauline, imagining the distinctly un-fluffy story such books will tell: &#8216;[She] found routes by which goods could be carried at greater speed and less cost, and so she revolutionized trade.&#8221; Hardly the dreams of a &#8216;beautiful child&#8217;.</p>
<p>For Petrova, as for so many of Streatfeild&#8217;s children not given to performing art (and there are a surprising number, despite her reputation), the most important lesson of stage school is self-sufficiency, a goal underlined across all the books by the fact that the overwhelming majority of child-characters have no parents to speak of, or are lumbered with a domineering guardian to struggle against (notably in <strong>Ballet Shoes For Anna</strong> and <strong>White Boots</strong>). With their realist emphasis, and the lessons that &#8216;even&#8217; little girls can get on in a world assailed by stupidity, war, and even natural disasters, I can think of no better author to recommend to absolutely everyone you know.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<h6 style="text-align: center;">G</h6>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">GIRL</h2>
<blockquote><p>And alone in the midst of all this lumber and decay, and ugly age, the beautiful child in her gentle slumber, smiling through her light and sunny dreams.<br />
&#8211; <strong>Charles Dickens, The Old Curiosity Shop</strong> (1841)</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8216;Twas brillig</strong></p>
<p>Picture the linguistic landscape of the thirteenth century. Full of bastard Latin, Anglo-Norman, smatterings of Anglo-Saxon crudities, and a few words whose origins nobody knows. Sometime around 1290, the word <em>girl </em>appeared, used to signify ‘a child or young person of either sex’, alongside clarifying compounds <em>knave girl </em>and <em>gay girl </em>(‘boy’ and, er, ‘girl’ respectively). Like some tantalisingly similar words &#8211; <em>lad, lass, boy </em>&#8211; its provenance is unclear, although some cunning linguists would have it derive ultimately (via some torturous and dark history) from the Greek &#8216;parthenos&#8217; (=&#8217;virgin&#8217;). But yes, uh huh, you read right: in its earliest incarnation, <em>girl </em>was ungendered. In fact, it was not until the 1530s that its more specific application to XX chromosomes surfaced, with <em>girl </em>meaning ‘a female child’ &#8211; and even then, it still had its enduring reference to &#8216;a roebuck in its second year&#8217;, with roe<em>buck</em> being, naturally, the male equivalent of <em>roe</em> (a deer, a female deer).</p>
<h3>Dear, dear</h3>

<p>So the Sylvanian Deer Family would be made up of a roebuck, a roedeer, and, perhaps a (male) girl. Not actually that uncommon: after all, we classify animals via male, female and child (calf, cow, bull; pup, bitch, dog) with a third, genderless young&#8217;un alongside their sexually mature parents all the time.</p>
<p>Here comes an art history aside to <em>girl&#8217;</em>s ambiguous beginnings: glancing, for example at<a href="http://gallery.e2bn.org/imagelarge70483-abolition.html"> Queen Victoria with her family</a>, a  <a href="http://www.artchive.com/artchive/v/velazquez/velazquez_prince.jpg">young prince of Spain</a>, or even an English <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/exhibitions/hogarth/images/works/the_graham_children.jpg">merchant family of the 1740s</a>, the gender identities of the under-6s seem, well, fluid at best. I should add that, in the case of the Spanish Royal Family, the eldest prince (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balthasar_Charles,_Prince_of_Asturias">Baltasar Carlos</a>) leaps straight from painterly petticoats to politically potent riding gear and full armour with apparently no mid-point whatsoever. Another prince, the young Charles II, appears in full armour aged twelve, although in his case there were excellent practical reasons for the switchover (lol revolution). There is also James Northcote&#8217;s portrait (right) of John Ruskin, art historian, antiquarian, arguable founder of the National Trust, patron of the Pre-Raphaelites and sometime author &#8211; aged three and a half. Manly indeed.</p>
<p>This could speak of a reluctance to bother gendering the child until that gender could be of socio-political relevance (something infant mortality could only have encouraged), but that is not to say it went un-bemoaned by the children themselves. The poet Rainer Maria Rilke complained bitterly of his mother&#8217;s reign of sartorial terror: &#8216;I had to wear beautiful long dresses, and until I started school I went about like a little girl. I think my mother played with me as though I were a big <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/10/25/an-alphabet-of-femininism-4-d-is-for-doll/">doll</a>.&#8217; I am also reminded of the story that hit headlines in Sweden about<a href="http://www.thelocal.se/20232/20090623/"> a couple who refused to gender their two-year-old at all, for fear of falling into gender&#8217;s traps</a>.</p>
<h3>Not yet a woman</h3>

<p>But, as we may ask of this Swedish child, what happens to <em>girl </em>once its gender has been set? Well, one of its first gender-specific definitions is, as of 1668, ‘a maid of all work’; <em>sweetheart</em> or <em>mistress</em> makes its appearance towards the end of the eighteenth century (as in the popular song ‘The Girl I Left Behind Me&#8217;); and it appears in compound reference to prostitution – <em>a kind girl, girl about town</em>. These are all potentially belittling terms for female-orientated stations in life, which can nonetheless retain a flattering appeal ­– think <a href="http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0027816/">Patsy Stone</a> and her insistence on being referred to as &#8216;mademoiselle&#8217;; or, more psychotically, think Bette Davis in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ck-Uo52MOg">W<em>hatever Happened To Baby Jane</em></a>?</p>
<p>So, actually, as <em>girl </em>grows up, it sexes up: indeed, once gendered firmly female, its sexual identity becomes more complicated, and this is something that seems to go alongside a developing idea of what early youth actually <em>is</em>. It is only really with the Victorians that the ‘cult of childhood’ really came into being, upheld by luminaries such as J. M. Barrie, Ruskin himself, Charles Dickens and, of course, Lewis Carroll.</p>
<p>This is where whispers start snaking around history, and it feels fitting that the term <em>paedophilia erotica </em>did not come into diagnostic existence until 1886, for this was arguably the first time childhood was regarded with fetishism (as later underlines the actions of &#8216;poet and pervert&#8217; Humbert Humbert, in Nabokov&#8217;s now-notorious <em>Lolita</em>). <em>Girls</em> suddenly become not simply small genderless adults, but (feminine) symbols of what adulthood is seen to lack: innocence, purity and beauty, as in Dickens&#8217; <em>The Old Curiosity Shop</em>, whose Little Nell loves to say her prayers. Dickens&#8217; adult females fare little better, of course, and the Victorian infantalisation of women proves <em>girl </em>in grown-up action, and a topic for another day.</p>
<p>This, then, is the context for Carroll&#8217;s photography, but it is important to note that, whatever their evidence for something darker, their subject matter was by no means original: Carroll&#8217;s contemporary, Julia Margaret Cameron, produced many <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_MmRVVROy-Jo/ShwBSPlo2CI/AAAAAAAADAE/gxI5PfHTgNM/s400/Julia+Margaret+Cameron6.jpg">similar images</a> (worksafety check: mild nudity) that played on girlish simplicity for typically Victorian effect.</p>
<blockquote><p>[She was] the most beautiful little girl that Tom had ever seen. Her cheeks were almost as white as the pillow and her hair was like threads of gold spread all about over the bed.</p>
<p>He wondered if she was a real live person, or one of the wax dolls he had seen in the shops.</p>
<p>&#8211; Charles Kingsley, The Water Babies (1862-3)</p></blockquote>
<p>A strange journey, then: a word that commences genderless and ends sexualised and technically belittling (&#8216;the checkout girl&#8217;), but without much perceptible backlash from the female population. Are we not all Patsy Stones?</p>
