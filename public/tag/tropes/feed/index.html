<li><em>We’re pleased to welcome Libby of the feminist-friendly <a href="http://treasuryislands.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">TreasuryIslands</a> blog back to our soapbox today. (She&#8217;s officially our most recurring guest!) If you have a guest post a-brewing, <a href="mailto:badrepeditors@gmail.com?subject=pitch">email us on badrepeditors@gmail.com</a>.</em>
<li></ul>
<p><strong>American Horror Story</strong> is sexy.</p>
<p>No, let me rephrase that.</p>
<p>American Horror Story is SEXY. It emanates sweet tendrils of hotness, wisps of decadent, lustful sexual deviance and sultry taboo, while trotting apace through a veritable phalanx of horror tropes and borrowing heavily from the classics of the genre. I love it. It is also, in the words of the hilarious <a href="http://isthisfeminist.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Is This Feminist? tumblr</a>, PROBLEMATIC.</p>

<p>And who’s surprised, really? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Murphy_(writer)" target="_blank">Ryan Murphy</a>’s work is characterised by its casual misogyny (yo, <strong>Nip/Tuck</strong>, <strong>Glee</strong>, I’m looking at you) and so is horror as a genre. So not me, no. I’m not surprised, Mr Murphy, I’m not even angry. I’m just disappointed. Maybe you should go to your room and think about what you’ve done.</p>
<p>Now, don’t get me wrong. <strong>AHS</strong> is, by any critical standard, a terrible, terrible show. It’s fractured and bombastic and desperately wants to be, like, profound. But it’s not. It’s&#8230; y’know. Crap.</p>
<p>But luckily, I’m not a TV critic, so I bloody love it. And I’m allowed to love it because cognitive dissonance. This show is simply dripping with things that ought to make me hate it. And I do. I spit expletives at the screen. I rage against the covert anti-abortionism and the exploitative male gaze. And then I rewind and watch it again. Because, like I said. Cognitive dissonance.</p>
<p>I’m going to handle <strong>AHS</strong> in two parts. Today I’ll be examining the show&#8217;s representations of women as lovers and mothers, before looking at pregnancy, birth and maternal desire in the next exciting instalment.</p>
<p><strong>Before I go on, beware. Here be SPOILERS.</strong></p>
<h3>Predatory Women in the Male Gaze</h3>
<p><strong>AHS</strong> is not much more than your typical haunted house story. It begins and ends with the house, designated ‘Murder House’ by local legend and built by Charles and Nora Montgomery decades before our protagonists &#8211; we’ll get to them later &#8211; were born.</p>
<p>The Montgomerys run an illegal abortion clinic from the basement, providing discreet help to women in trouble and fuelling the God complex which eventually sees the ether-addicted Charles sew together a Franken-baby &#8211; known as the Infanta &#8211; for his wife to care for. If we were looking for a symbolic representation of threat to the constructed (read: patriarchal) order of things, well, it doesn’t get any more obvious than that. Like Dr Frankenstein, Charles blurs the boundaries not just between God and man but also between male and female roles by creating life, upsetting the proper balance of the house and setting in motion the events which follow.</p>
<p>Nora and Charles’ lives end in a murder-suicide at Nora’s hand. Thus, they become the first to haunt the house.The third post-human (‘ghost’ is such an oppressive term, right?) resident of the house is Moira. Let’s start her story with a little pop quiz:</p>
<p><em>You, the lady of the house, enter your home to hear a woman being sexually assaulted. You pick up a gun &#8211; because they’re totally safe to have around when emotions are running high &#8211; and enter the master bedroom to find your husband raping the maid. You point the gun and fire. Who did you just kill? Was it &#8211;</em></p>
<p><em>a) your husband, because he’s a rapey scumbag?</em><br />
<em> b) Moira the maid, because, er&#8230; um&#8230; she’s there too?</em></p>
<p>If you said <em>b) Moira the maid</em>, congratulations! You hate women as much as <strong>American Horror Story</strong> does!</p>
<p>To be fair, this woman scorned does go on to shoot her husband too, but that maid, well. She was probably asking for it, wasn’t she, all walking around in clothes and getting on with her job and having breasts. What a slut.</p>
<p>Regardless of her intention or her consent, Moira is now a sexual predator, in death forced to play the role perceived as hers in life, and becomes a Jekyll-and-Hyde figure. The women she encounters see her as a sexless middle-aged woman, while the men (who, it seems, see only what they want to see) see a young, beautiful and carnivorously sexual temptress, seeking to undermine, manipulate or overthrow men through the power of her sexuality. She is the virgin/whore dichotomy made flesh.</p>
<p>I could get into how heterosexist this is, but frankly we’d be here for days. The height of Moira’s sexual power comes with the literal castration of the man who most poses a threat to her. Dr. Freud, you’re needed in the Literalisation of Symbolic Acts ward. Bring a towel.</p>
<p>The newest residents of Murder House are Vivien and Ben Harmon, a Bostonian couple intent on running away and leaving their marital problems behind them, because that always works. Moving into their suspiciously underpriced new home with their adolescent daughter is their first step towards repairing the damage done to the partnership by Ben’s affair with a student named Hayden in the aftermath of Vivien’s miscarriage.</p>
<p>Just as Moira ends up dead for having sex and getting above her station, so does Hayden. Hayden’s not above throwing herself at Ben, turning up at his home in an act of seduction and intimidation to rival the fatal-est of femmes.</p>
<p>We’re encouraged into this reading of women as wild by the show&#8217;s insistent male gaze.</p>
<p>A complex mythology that rules whether or not the ghosts age ensures that we get enough young female flesh to look at. There are lingering shots of gartered thighs and softly rising décolletée, there are those close, oppressive, slightly-from-above camera angles that make you feel like you dominate the subject &#8211; and there are straight-up no-holds-barred crotch shots. All of these things make sure we know where, and how, to look.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">These women are women as men wish (or as gay men think straight/bi men wish) to see them: willing harbingers of sexual pleasure, built in the eye of the camera from tits and ass.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">They’re supple-breasted and conveniently bisexual, with sexuality so magnetic that Ben must masturbate furiously &#8211; crying all the while &#8211; to stop himself from giving in to them. Where women are concerned, perceived sexual immorality is a barometer for bad. They are debased, and they will hurt you.</p>
<h3>The hand that rocks the cradle is the hand that rules the world</h3>
<p>Motherhood comes in for a bad rap on <strong>AHS</strong>. From episode one (where Vivien’s longed for-pregnancy is spoken of in terms of an unwanted visitor violating the sacred space of the home) to the monstrous child-delivery at the end of the season, childbearing is painted as a threat to patriarchal social order. I’ll talk more about that next time, but for now I want to concentrate on what happens once you’ve got a bleating infant in your arms.</p>
<p>Another previous resident of Vivien and Ben’s home, and one of the few that is still living, is local Mommie Dearest Constance Langdon. She’s the self-appointed caretaker of the house, an amoral force of unfathomable intentions who appears to consider <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norma_Bates_(Psycho)" target="_blank">Mrs Bates</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_White" target="_blank">Margaret White</a> her parenting role models.</p>
<p>Constance is a cruel, jealous single parent, abusing and using her children by turns. Unable to relinquish control of her brood as they age, and thus not allowing them autonomous identities, she ensures that dysfunction reins in the Langdon household.</p>
<p>She treats <a href="http://specialchildren.about.com/b/2011/10/05/will-this-depiction-of-down-syndrome-be-a-horror-story.htm" target="_blank">her daughter Addie</a>, who has Down syndrome, as a sexual competitor. She imprisons both her daughter and her heavily-disfigured eldest son, the ironically-named Beauregard, in the home (sometimes resorting to shackles and chains as a demonstration of her sovereignty) and gleefully tells Addie that she’ll never be a &#8216;pretty girl&#8217;.<sup><a href="/2012/12/03/guest-post-on-american-horror-story-part-12-lovers-and-mothers/#footnote_0_12758" id="identifier_0_12758" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" Ed&rsquo;s Tiny Note: For more on Addie and how she is portrayed and treated, there&rsquo;s a critical look at her role at Fangs for the Fantasy. Down Syndrome Daily also has a roundup of US press reactions to the character, some of which I think betray ableist prejudice in themselves, and some of which make good points. ">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Although all of her children are dead before they reach adulthood, the youngest remains as one of the fully corporeal phantoms haunting the Harmon household. Despite her treatment of her children, Constance is willing to kill to keep them together. The whole set-up screams narcissistic abuse.</p>
<p>Constance’s stranglehold over her youngest son, Tate, has prevented him from self-actualisation and produced an emotionally scarred adolescent, narcissistic and hypermasculine, who apes his mother in his desire for control over the bodies of others, raping and indiscriminately killing in order to exert his ownership. What a charmer.</p>
<p>Tate’s emotional state almost demands to be analysed as a reaction to Constance&#8217;s total control over the boy in the second stage of psychosexual development, which coincides with toilet training and in which autonomy is developed. Constance’s suppression of Tate’s self-actualisation has resulted in a rebellious, cruel, emotionally volatile adolescent who is so eager to please the woman he’s fixated on that he’ll commit terrible acts to gain her approval. It’s desperately clichéd.</p>
<p>Sexualised as it is, <strong>AHS</strong>’ regular female cast is not made up of victims in the great tradition of the genre: they don’t get cut up, and there’s no running through dark corridors in strategically torn clothing or fumbling ineffectually with locks that they could work perfectly well a minute ago.</p>
<p>This has caused some people to herald the show as a feminist buoy, bobbing about in the misogynist soup of Horror. Such is the jubilation at the thought that women might be allowed some agency, the flipside is missed. The show doesn’t victimise its women; it demonises them. In this world women are either maidens or mothers, either sexual or not.</p>
<p>And damn, they’ve got it in for you.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello. My name is Rei, and I read romance novels.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello. My name is Rei, and I read romance novels.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been weirdly obsessed with romance novels for about the past two years. I read my first one a lot longer ago than that – I abducted and read, over a period of about three weeks, a romance with a name I can&#8217;t remember about a Japanese lady falling in love with an American man just after World War II during my breaks in volunteering at a nursing home – but I didn&#8217;t really think all that much about them for a while afterwards. Then I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.smartbitchestrashybooks.com">Smart Bitches, Trashy Books</a> and started following it because, damn, those ladies are hilarious, and from there started following <a href="http://dearauthor.com">Dear Author</a> as well, who focus on snark a little less (although they can also be pretty funny) but who are nevertheless thoughtful and insightful in their reviews. For a long time, I was an avid follower of the romance industry without ever actually having picked up more than two romances.</p>
<p>And then I got a Kindle for Christmas.</p>
<p>You guys, for the reluctant obsessive, ebook readers are poison in super-convenient button-clicky packaging. Thanks to its extreme user-friendliness and the large number of freebooks available on the Amazon website (in case anybody is worried that I&#8217;m being paid for advertising, the wireless keeps breaking and sometimes the thing refuses to charge) I have something like one hundred romance novels on my Kindle now – a conservative estimate, not taking into account non-category romances and books debatably qualified for the title. I can&#8217;t stop reading them, and I can&#8217;t stop talking about them; I am fascinated by romance novels, in spite of the fact that more often than not picking one up guarantees that I will spend half the book with my jaw clenched to the point of pain. It&#8217;s a guilty pleasure, if by “pleasure” you mean “bafflement-inducing” and “guilty” you mean “thing that I am liable to be judged for”.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/boon.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="11742" data-permalink="/2012/08/01/new-series-hopeless-reimantic/boon/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/boon.jpg?fit=168%2C124&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="168,124" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="boon" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/boon.jpg?fit=168%2C124&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/boon.jpg?fit=168%2C124&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/boon.jpg?resize=168%2C124" alt="The pink Mills and Boon logo: an ampersand with a rose growing out of it. Slogan below says &#039;bring romance to life&#039;." title="boon" width="168" height="124" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-11742" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>So what brings me to all the jaw-clenching? Well, I&#8217;ve been a reader ever since I was a kid – I&#8217;ve tried pretty much every genre of fiction, from fantasy to crime to sci-fi to sci-fi fantasy crime – and category romance is, without question, the most formulaic genre I have ever come across. It&#8217;s baffling. I mean, every genre has its stock characters and tropes, but while there are things that crop up a lot in, say, fantasy, as far as I can see the only thing really required to write a fantasy novel is the strong enough conviction that what you&#8217;re writing is fantasy. Write a category romance, and your story is pretty much plotted out for you. Don&#8217;t believe me? Let&#8217;s take a look at the submission guidelines for <a href="http://uat2.millsandboon.co.uk/AAModernR.asp">Mills and Boon Modern Romance</a> (the UK version of Harlequin Presents):</p>
<blockquote><p>Readers are whisked away to exclusive jet-set locations&#8230;When the hero strides into the story he&#8217;s a powerful, ruthless man who knows exactly what &#8211; and who &#8211; he wants and he isn&#8217;t used to taking no for an answer! Yet he has depth and integrity, and he will do anything to make the heroine his. Though she may be shy and vulnerable, she&#8217;s also plucky and determined to challenge his arrogant pursuit.</p>
<p>Modern Romance explores emotional themes that are universal. These should be played out as part of highly-charged conflicts that are underpinned by blistering sexual anticipation and released as passionate lovemaking&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Got that? So, your story has to be somewhere “exclusive and jet-set” (what does “jet-set” actually mean in this context? I sort of expect the entire thing to be set in the Business Class lounge at Stansted) and your hero needs to be a Romance Novel Hero, you know, hot and alpha and, well, willing to be kind of creepy if he thinks it&#8217;ll help. (Bonus points if he&#8217;s so manly that his manliness bursts out of the cover &#8211; for reference, please see the pictured-below edition of <strong>The Very Virile Viking</strong>, one of the most beautifully alliteratively-titled works of romance that I have ever come across.) And your heroine needs to challenge him but also be vulnerable to him. And they need to clash and eventually express that clash through a lot of hot sex.</p>

And this moulding of the romance novel storyline doesn&#8217;t stop with the publishing guidelines; the romance novel review websites I follow do downgrade books that fail to deliver on agreed-upon “romance trademarks”, although in fairness the only one that seems to need strict adherence is that of the HEA (that&#8217;s Happily Ever After, to those of you who use their time much more wisely than I do). Even that strikes me as strange, because while I can understand it as a trend – if, as common theory purports, romance novels are wish fulfilment fantasies, why wouldn&#8217;t they have a happy ending? &#8211; I can&#8217;t wrap my head around it as the thing which makes a romance novel <em>romantic</em>. More on that later.</p>
<p>Which brings me, finally, to this: Why do I think it useful to subject romance novels to feminist analysis? Aren&#8217;t they just, as a friend of mine once put it, “granny porn”? Is there any mileage in analysing such an outdated form of trashy entertainment from a feminist perspective?</p>
<p>I obviously think so, or I wouldn&#8217;t be writing this. And here&#8217;s why: <em>most romance novel writers are women, writing for a female audience</em>. I&#8217;ve read some (very good) romance novels written by men geared towards women, but only a very few, and they tend to focus on gay male couplings – in other words, not part of the main body of mainstream romance publishing. (LGBT people in romance novels is a whole &#8216;nother article.) More troubling is that most of the flaws and foibles of romance tropes that persist even today – virginal women, marriage and babies or nothing, and the time-honoured classic of “forced seduction” &#8211; are overwhelmingly shrugged off as “it&#8217;s just wish fulfilment”.</p>
<p>Is it?</p>
<p>As a lifelong avid reader, I&#8217;m no stranger to escaping into a good book. And I have no doubt that there are people out there who don&#8217;t really want a relationship in which the man takes charge, sweeps the lady off her feet, and loves her with a love that&#8217;s never been loved before until her resolve melts into baby-making funtimes, but can still get into a traditional romance plotline just for kicks. But is this still (or has it ever been) so overpoweringly The Female Fantasy that it&#8217;s the go-to, the default, the only world a romance fan wants to escape into? Why are these elements so built into “women&#8217;s” fiction? And what, in the end, does that tell us about the cultural narrative that has been built around us?</p>
<p>Those are the questions I want to answer; they&#8217;re the main thing going around in my head every time I pick up a new romance, and they are what keeps me reading whenever I finish one that has made me want to drill a hole through my skull. (Which isn&#8217;t all of them! Some are quite good. Maybe someday I&#8217;ll tell you about them.)</p>
<p>To get us started, though, over the next few weeks I&#8217;ll be doing a rundown of what I think are the five most central tropes or stock characters in romance novels. It&#8217;s going to be difficult to whittle the list down that far, but I&#8217;ll power through it. Honest. I don&#8217;t really need this university education.</p>
<p>Over the course of the series, I&#8217;ll look at the trope itself, where, when and how it shows up in different genres, and how I think it&#8217;s been adapted for the modern romance novel, because if there&#8217;s another thing that seems to be true of romance? It&#8217;s that they never throw anything away. I&#8230;am no one to judge on that, as anybody who&#8217;s seen my living space will be able to attest, but there&#8217;s an impressive level of trope-hoarding that goes on around here, and I&#8217;m going to show you why. I&#8217;ll also be probing a bit into what that means for romance storylines as a whole.</p>
<p>So stay tuned for Instalment One, which is going to be the aforementioned Virginal Heroine! Are you excited? I&#8217;m excited.</p>
<p>See you then!</p>
