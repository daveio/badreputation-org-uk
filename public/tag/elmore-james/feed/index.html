<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/nBA2REoRD98?rel=0" frameborder="0" width="500" height="375"></iframe></p>
<p>This song was brought into my life a few years ago by my Mum, a reliable source of excellent music. It&#8217;s a blues standard, but my preferred version is Elmore James&#8217; 1962 recording, with his incredible voice and slide guitar.</p>
<p>While <strong>It Hurts Me Too</strong> is superficially about a man&#8217;s love for a woman who loves another (highly unpleasant) man, to me it could as easily be about platonic love as romantic love. I&#8217;m bringing my own experiences to bear of course, but to me it sits on the same shelf as Strawberry Switchblade&#8217;s <a title="YouTube - Strawberry Switchblade Let Her Go" href="http://youtu.be/pjLjDLto_Eo" target="_blank"><strong>Let Her Go</strong></a> or the Dresden Dolls&#8217; <a title="YouTube - Dresden Dolls Delilah" href="http://youtu.be/rnnMad3c9y4" target="_blank"><strong>Delilah</strong></a>. It&#8217;s about watching from the sidelines, furious and helpless as someone you care about gets hurt, over and over again. For me it is inescapably about abuse.</p>
<p>While the song is old and has been re-interpreted time and again, when Elmore James recorded his version he made some lyrical changes to the hit version recorded by <a title="YouTube - Tampa Red When Things Go Wrong With You" href="http://youtu.be/bYiU5JBiTPE" target="_blank">Tampa Red</a> in 1949. Comparing the two there&#8217;s a subtle shift from a reasonably upbeat song imploring an object of desire to leave a cheating no-gooder, to a heartbreaking lament for the trap in which a loved one has been snared.</p>
<p>For example, <a title="Lyricstime - Tampa Red, When Things Go Wrong With You" href="http://www.lyricstime.com/tampa-red-when-things-go-wrong-with-you-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Tampa Red</a> sings:</p>
<blockquote><p>That man you love, darlin&#8217;<br />
He don&#8217;t want you &#8217;round<br />
Whyn&#8217;t ya make love with Tampa, darling?<br />
And let&#8217;s jump the town<br />
When things go wrong, so wrong, with you<br />
It hurts me, too</p></blockquote>
<p>And James sings:</p>
<blockquote><p>He love another woman, yes, I love you,<br />
But, you love him and stick to him like glue.<br />
When things go wrong, oh, wrong with you<br />
It hurts me too.</p></blockquote>
<p>What I like best about it is that unlike many other blues standards (and plenty of mainstream pop songs &#8211; see Jimi Hendrix&#8217;s <a title="Sing 365 - Hey Joe" href="http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Hey-Joe-lyrics-Jimi-Hendrix/103C62A5FFA678AC4825695F0024E91A" target="_blank"><strong>Hey Joe</strong></a>, The Beatles&#8217; <a title="Songmeanings - Run For Your Life" href="http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/930/" target="_blank"><strong>Run For Your Life</strong></a>, Tom Jones&#8217; <a title="Lyricstime - Delilah" href="http://www.lyrics007.com/Tom%20Jones%20Lyrics/Delilah%20Lyrics.html" target="_blank"><strong>Delilah</strong></a>), <strong>It Hurts Me Too</strong> is a song about empathy, not jealousy. The singer claims no ownership over the woman, it&#8217;s her suffering that pains him, not the fact he can&#8217;t have her. For me, it works as an antidote to the musical tradition of the jealous murder of women by men. I believe it&#8217;s a song about love in the truest, broadest sense: what you feel, I feel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>It Hurts Me Too</strong>  by Elmore James</p>
<p><em>You said you was hurtin&#8217;, you almost lost your mind.<br />
Now, the man you love, he hurt you all the time.<br />
But, when things go wrong, oh, wrong with you, It hurts me too.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll love him more when you should love him less.<br />
Why lick up behind him and take his mess?<br />
But, when things go wrong, whoa, wrong with you, It hurts me too.</p>
<p>He love another woman, yes, I love you,<br />
But, you love him and stick to him like glue.<br />
When things go wrong, oh, wrong with you, It hurts me too.</p>
<p>Now, he better leave you or you better put him down.<br />
No, I won&#8217;t stand to see you pushed around.<br />
But, when things go wrong, oh, wrong with you, It hurts me too.</em></p>
