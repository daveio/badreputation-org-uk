<p>A <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qk11"><strong>Moral Maze</strong></a> came on the radio, aiming to address the moral challenges around the government&#8217;s <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-18881046">Troubled Families</a> initiative, in the wake of the government&#8217;s &#8216;Broken Britain Tsar&#8217;, Louise Casey, suggesting that women in these families should be financially discouraged from having more children if they are struggling to cope at present. This comes off the back of Eric Pickles saying we&#8217;re too politically correct to lay blame where it belongs, which is with the troubled families where recidivistic criminality and truancy endures across several generations.</p>
<p>It is, they suggest, a moral failure of the families who languish on benefits that they do not lift themselves out of antisocial behaviour and state dependency.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01l0kcc#synopsis">this <strong>Moral Maze</strong></a>, it was said more than once &#8220;we all know who these families are&#8221; when panel members asked for clarification on whether they were discussing troubled or troublesome families.</p>
<p>The criteria for being regarded as a Troubled Family are that a family has five or more of the following seven traits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having a low income</li>
<li>No one in the family who is working</li>
<li>Poor housing</li>
<li>Parents who have no qualifications</li>
<li>The mother has a mental health problem</li>
<li>One parent has a longstanding illness or disability</li>
<li>The family is unable to afford basics, including food and clothes</li>
</ul>
<p>Source: they&#8217;re <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/ios-exclusive-problem-families-told--stop-blaming-others-7834235.html">outlined in this <strong>Independent</strong> piece</a>. </p>
<p>However, the <strong>Moral Maze</strong>&#8216;s panel also discussed some very loaded terms like &#8220;serial fatherlessness&#8221; which seemed to point quite firmly to where they apportion the blame for this supposed crisis.</p>
<p>Of course, like most government statistics, the figure of 120,000 families in the UK meeting this definition is disputed, with most attempts to replicate the research finding far, far fewer families than in the initial research.</p>

There are obvious echoes to the description of &#8220;feral youths&#8221; we had a year ago when the country was ablaze with rioting.</p>
<p>To me, the most pernicious aspect of the definition is the bias against disabled people, particularly against disabled women. Since it&#8217;s far harder for disabled people to find decent education or well-paid employment, and since depression and other mental health challenges are incredibly common among disabled people (perhaps because we&#8217;re being told that our problems are our own moral inadequacies?), it seems like a given that most families where one or both parents are disabled are automatically well on the way to being labelled as problematic.</p>
<p>In fact, if you examine a family where neither parent is ill, disabled or has mental health problems, they must meet all five of the remaining criteria, but a disabled family where the mother has mental health issues need only meet three of the five non-health-related factors to be labelled as problematic.</p>
<p>If you then add in the idea that the mothers in troubled families should be discouraged, perhaps financially, from having more children than they can afford or cope with, we&#8217;re worryingly close to a programme of eugenics that disproportionately targets disabled and mentally ill women.</p>
<p>The discussion on <strong>Moral Maze</strong> didn&#8217;t pick up on this point, seemingly assuming that it should be taken as read that ill-health and impairment, whether physical or mental, constitutes a problem for society.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a disturbingly regressive idea that in order to end poverty, you end the poor, and one that should be challenged with passion at every turn.</p>
<p>Reading through earlier government documents relating to this, however, paints a different picture to the one now being presented by ministers. The definition there ran:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, examine families where either there is proof of the child having committed a crime or where a member of the family has an ASBO or similar charge around social conduct.</li>
<li>Secondly, identify families where a child has been regularly excluded from school, has 15% or higher unauthorised absence or where the child is regularly truanting.</li>
<li>If families meet one of the two, then examine if no-one in the family works or is in post-compulsory education (one of those NEETs &#8211; Not in Employment, Education or Training).</li>
<li>After examining these identifying factors, local considerations may be applied where families meet two or three of the above factors exist and there is cause for concern.</li>
</ul>
<p>These local considerations can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where a family member has been in prison in the last year, where the police have been called out regularly, where the family is involved in a gang or where they are prolific offenders.</li>
<li>Where a child is on the child protection register or where the local authority is considering taking the child into care.</li>
<li>Where a family member has long-term health problems, particularly:
<p>                 Emotional and mental health problems<br />
                 Drug and alcohol misuse<br />
                 Long term health conditions<br />
                 Health problems caused by domestic abuse<br />
                 Under 18 conceptions</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, this list of issues seems problematic, but less so when you take into account the idea that these should only be considered once it&#8217;s established that there are problems with criminality or where the child is not attending school often enough. Worklessness is given less priority than these and health problems such as alchoholism are even less relevant.</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/communities/pdf/2117840.pdf">this Troubled Families Programme PDF from March 2012.</a></p>
<p>I think that the shift from what this document describes to the seven traits of unsuccessful people defined above and communicated by ministers more recently is incredibly telling in determining the underlying ideology at play here. Rather than say that criminality and absence from school or the structure of employment, education or training are the main challenges facing families and requiring intervention, we&#8217;re left with the impression that there are wickedly immoral, lazy people, primarily the poor, disabled people and single mothers, who are tearing apart the fabric of the country.</p>
<p>The original notion &#8211; that families who are troubled and troubling through antisocial or criminal behaviour, where children are being denied the life chances that education provides, could do with additional support and intervention to assist them in re-introducing structure to what can often be a chaotic and fraught existence &#8211; seems sound. To turn this into yet another attack on poor people, disabled people and women just seems like a moral failure of government, and that, I think, is far more likely to tear the country apart.</p>

<p>One of the 19<sup>th</sup> century’s best-loved stereotypes is that shivering waif, the Match Girl. Standing in the snow in a tattered shawl and starving to death in a picturesque way, she is well known to all of us thanks in large part to <a href="http://www.online-literature.com/hans_christian_andersen/981/">Hans Christian Anderson</a>.<sup><a href="/2011/09/06/revolting-women-the-matchgirls-strike-or-working-class-teenagers-kick-corporate-ass/#footnote_0_6095" id="identifier_0_6095" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" I am being flippant here but in fact the story reduces me to a crying mess of sentimentality and socialist idealism. There&rsquo;s also a good recent Disney / Pixar animation. For a horrible moment I thought they were going to happy-end it a la The Little Mermaid and The Hunchback of Notre Dame but they let her die. ">1</a></sup> In Victorian Britain her colleagues worked only slightly less prettily making the matches in factories under horrific working conditions. Many of them were girls too, teenagers and children who started work well before the age of 10.<br />

I&#8217;m not saying for a moment that life wasn&#8217;t hellish for the matchgirls, and the rest of the Victorian working classes. But I welcome any attempt to dig a little deeper than the hand-wringing <a href="http://www.bapla.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=46&amp;Itemid=89&amp;favm=2098&amp;stype=story">waifporn</a> of many contemporary accounts to uncover the experiences and agency of actual persons.</p>
<p>One famous event which lends these pathetic characters another dimension and a bit of agency is the Bow Bryant &amp; May match factory strike of 1888. The broadly accepted chain of events is this…</p>
<h3>Annie Besant</h3>
<p>Outspoken socialist, women’s rights campaigner and general lefty do-gooder <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Besant"><strong>Annie Besant</strong></a> heard a lecture by <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Wblack.htm">Clementina Black</a> about the terrible working conditions in Bryant &amp; May factories. She discovered that the women worked 14 hours a day for less than five shillings a week, and didn’t often receive this thanks to a system of fines for offences including talking, dropping matches or going to the toilet without permission.</p>

<p>Besant also learnt that the women’s health had been damaged by the phosphorous used to make the matches, which caused yellowing of the skin, hair loss and ‘phossy jaw’, a jolly name for a particularly gruesome kind of facial bone cancer.</p>
<p>Appalled, Besant went to the gates of the factory in Bow the next day and interviewed some of the women as they were leaving. Having the stories confirmed, she wrote an article for her newspaper <strong>The Link</strong> with the incendiary title ‘<a href="http://www.mernick.org.uk/thhol/thelink.html">White Slavery In London</a>&#8216;.</p>
<p>In response to the bad PR, Bryant &amp; May cleverly attempted to force their workers to sign a statement that they were happy with their working conditions. When a group of women refused to sign, the organisers of the group were sacked, and the rest of the workforce reacted: 1,400 of the women at Bryant &amp; May went on strike.</p>
<p>Cue national uproar. Besant gathered support for her campaign from a number of prominent figures who all seem to have had their own newspapers, and they used them to call for a boycott of Bryant &amp; May matches. The women at the company formed a Matchgirls&#8217; Union and Besant agreed to become its leader. After three weeks the company announced that it would re-employ the dismissed women and bring an end to the fines system. The sacked women returned in triumph.</p>
<h3>Matchwomen</h3>
<p>According to this version of events, Annie Besant encouraged and led the factory workers to strike for better conditions. Certainly the identities of the girls and women involved in the strike have been obscured by her fame.</p>

<p>But a new book by <a href="http://www.louiseraw.co.uk/">Louise Raw</a> claims that the impetus and leadership for the strike came from the women themselves, and Annie Besant got most of the credit because she was already notorious. And because she was middle class &#8211; there were doubts in many circles that the matchwomen themselves could have organised their way out of a paper bag without the help of a learned socialist.</p>
<p>This <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=408305&amp;sectioncode=26"><strong>Times Higher Ed</strong></a> review of <<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Striking-Light-Bryant-Matchwomen-History/dp/1441114262/ref=tmm_pap_title_0"><strong>Striking a Light: The Truth About the Match Girls Strike and the Women Behind It</strong></a> explains that the matchwomen “have not been hidden from history but hidden by history” because the standard account of events very early on became the go-to example of women’s industrial action, even to the point of cliché, so historians have avoided revising it. Until now:</p>
<blockquote><p>In a careful reconstruction of events, Raw exposes inaccuracies in the standard accounts which, while petty, suggest a lazy acceptance of a chronology that fits the conventional story. Not only was Besant not the first mover, and she was probably neither sympathetic to strike action nor optimistic about its outcome, preferring instead a boycott of Bryant and May… Raw&#8217;s revised account has the match women themselves deciding to strike, generating leaders and possessing a solidarity usually denied to unskilled workers of this era, especially female ones.</p></blockquote>
<p>BBC History magazine recorded an interview with Raw, which is available as a <a href="http://www.louiseraw.co.uk/podcastapr1a.mp3">podcast</a>. If you’re at all interested I recommend it. In the interview she names the five ‘ringleaders’ identified by Bryant &amp; May &#8211; Kate Slater, Alice Barnes, Jane Wakely, Eliza Martin, Mary Driscoll – and describes newspaper accounts about their charisma, inspiring speeches and popularity with the other factory workers. Rather wonderfully, Raw was able to find out more about these women after three of their grandchildren approached her at her talks at the <a href="http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/docklands/">Museum in Docklands</a> and the <a href="http://www.raggedschoolmuseum.org.uk/nextgen/">Ragged School Museum</a>. Local history events FTW!</p>
<p>The Matchgirls&#8217; Strike is a landmark in the history of women and protest, but also in labour history. It famously inspired the Dockers’ Strike: the organisers sought advice from the Matchgirls Union and continually referenced them in their speeches.</p>

<h2>BUT WAIT! Where is the pop culture link?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Well, I reckon the story about the ‘troublemaker’ Eva Smith who leads a factory strike in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Inspector_Calls"><strong>An Inspector Calls</strong></a> may well have been inspired by the matchgirls. Here’s a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Av9BoOCDF_4&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=506s">YouTube clip</a> of the relevant bit.</li>
<li>Secondly, in the course of my researches I discovered that there is a MUSICAL version of the matchgirl’s story, called, er, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matchgirls"><strong>The Matchgirls</strong></a>. It looks appalling. Here’s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amqqwzTITck">one of the songs</a> from it.</li>
<li>Then I found out that lovely East London history music project <strong>Songs From The Howing Sea</strong> have done a song about the strike! <a href="http://www.songsfromthehowlingsea.com/wk-27-the-matchgirls-strike-video/">Listen here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="footnotes"><li id="footnote_0_6095" class="footnote"> I am being flippant here but in fact the story reduces me to a crying mess of sentimentality and socialist idealism. There’s also a good recent <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE7CVCuMz0">Disney / Pixar animation</a>. For a horrible moment I thought they were going to happy-end it a la <strong>The Little Mermaid</strong> and <strong>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</strong> but they let her die. </li></ol>]]></content:encoded>
