										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>A little late in being posted, perhaps, but hopefully still of interest! In which three BadReppers &#8211; <strong>Hannah Chutzpah</strong>, <strong>Stephen B</strong> and <strong>Viktoriya</strong> &#8211; chat about their experiences at <strong>Nine Worlds Geekfest</strong> this summer, and more generally about conventions, fandom and feminism.</em></p>
<h2>A more inclusive con?</h2>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/9w.jpeg"><img data-attachment-id="14010" data-permalink="/2013/09/11/what-does-an-inclusive-sci-fi-con-look-like-a-post-nine-worlds-roundtable/9w/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/9w.jpeg?fit=259%2C194&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="259,194" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="9w" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/9w.jpeg?fit=259%2C194&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/9w.jpeg?fit=259%2C194&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/9w-150x150.jpeg?resize=150%2C150" alt="9w" width="150" height="150" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-14010" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><strong>Stephen B:</strong> &#8220;I first noticed how unusually inclusive <a href="https://nineworlds.co.uk/" target="_blank">Nine Worlds</a> was about two minutes after collecting my badge from the front desk. Wandering down the corridor I found myself in&#8230; a <a href="https://nineworlds.co.uk/track/geek-feminism" target="_blank">geek feminism</a> session. </p>
<p>&#8220;I was greeted cheerfully and given a quick intro to what was going on, and then left to join the various groups sitting around the (very popular) room at tables and in small lively seated circles on the floor. The crowd in this room didn’t know my views or that I write for BadRep, and I’m a straight white male &#8211; generally not a famously marginalised group &#8211; but I felt immediately welcome. </p>
<p>&#8220;In the next room along, Bronies were playing guitar and handing out cupcakes. They also had a rave DJ. In that moment, I suspected this wasn’t going to be a typical SF convention.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Safe space?</h2>
<p><strong>Viktoriya:</strong> &#8220;I went to Nine Worlds and I wasn&#8217;t groped, harassed, belittled or condescended to. I felt comfortable enough to walk around dressed in my own clothes, and not necessarily the elaborate armour of ballgowns, cosplay or similar I&#8217;d adopted when frequenting prior conventions. </p>
<p>&#8220;More to the point, I felt comfortable enough to go around ON MY OWN. I can&#8217;t stress this enough. I stopped going to conventions because it had become apparent to me that I was paying a great deal of money to attend an event where it was pretty much guaranteed that I would be assaulted in some way, whereas daily assault is something most women can have for free simply by walking down the street in London. Why pay for the privilege?&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Not being groped, forcibly intoxicated, called a cocktease, an uppity feminist, a silly little girl, or asked to kiss someone for the amusement of male onlookers – it was like a whole new world.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Also, I managed to convince my work friend to come with me to Nine Worlds. You guys, you have no idea of the stress associated with this. </p>
<p>&#8220;What if someone was a dick to her? What if she was assaulted? What if she hated it? Then I would be the work friend who convinced her to spend money on the the thing that was dreadful. </p>
<p>&#8220;So not being groped, forcibly intoxicated, called a cocktease, an uppity feminist, a silly little girl, or asked to kiss someone for the amusement of male onlookers &#8211; it was like a whole new world.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Stephen:</strong> &#8220;It seems that every big convention recently has had a wave of harassment and bad experiences for some attendees. NineWorlds appeared to do things right instead, with a kick-ass <A href= https://nineworlds.co.uk/anti-harassment-policy >anti-harassment policy</a> and some seriously great content.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Running a content track</h2>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/brony-car.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="14006" data-permalink="/2013/09/11/what-does-an-inclusive-sci-fi-con-look-like-a-post-nine-worlds-roundtable/brony-car/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/brony-car.jpg?fit=918%2C1224&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="918,1224" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="brony car" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/brony-car.jpg?fit=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/brony-car.jpg?fit=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/brony-car-225x300.jpg?resize=225%2C300" alt="brony car" width="225" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-14006" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/brony-car.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/brony-car.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/brony-car.jpg?w=918&amp;ssl=1 918w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><strong>Hannah Chutzpah:</strong> &#8220;It was an honour and a privilege to be asked to run the <a href="https://nineworlds.co.uk/track/creative-writing" target="_blank">creative writing track</a>. I spent pretty much the whole run-up panicking and convinced my everything would be a huge disaster&#8230;. right up until the second session where my longtime frenemy &#8211; author <a href="https://nineworlds.co.uk/guest/hannah-eiseman-renyard" target="_blank"><strong>Chris Farnell</strong></a> &#8211; gave a talk on &#8216;<a href="https://nineworlds.co.uk/track/news/2013/08/02/working-time-machine-writing-time-travel-so-it-makes-sense" target="_blank">Working the Time Machine: writing time travel so it makes sense&#8217;</a>. </p>
<p>&#8220;We had a packed out room, with people hanging out the doors. Then, as the crowds left and I patted Chris and myself on the back, starting to believe this whole thing might work &#8211; this toy car, sent by the Bronies (pictured) whirred through the door full of cupcakes.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Fandom and atmosphere</h2>
<p><strong>Stephen: </strong>&#8220;Nine Worlds is set up to include a wide range of fandoms and geekery, and all the different fans are welcome in the same space. There was <em>so much</em> going on, I barely saw the other Team BadRep folks.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t just &#8216;here&#8217;s the gay corner&#8217;, so it felt much more open to (say) the B and the T and the Q of &#8216;LGBTQ*&#8217;. Which &#8211; as a bi girl &#8211; I found very, very refreshing.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Hannah:</strong> &#8220;I didn&#8217;t get out to as much of the rest of the fest as you two, but the main thing which spilled across every room, hallway, lobby, breakfast bar and so on was the extremely friendly and welcoming nature of the whole conference. </p>
<p>&#8220;The only other geek con I&#8217;ve been to was the SFX weekender, which wasn&#8217;t <em>unfriendly </em>, but I also can&#8217;t remember half as much mingling (or half as many reasons to mingle) as there were here.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Stephen:</strong> &#8220;I’m not a convention-goer. The friendly atmosphere and lack of judging at Nine Worlds was the kind of pleasant, safe space I’d assume any good con would try for, but from everything I’ve heard in recent years this one got it unusually right. </p>
<p>&#8220;I saw tweets from people saying that having dedicated LGBTQ* content made such a difference to their time there. Even the Bronies didn’t seem to get the usual derision, mostly because they were just unrelentingly happy and frequently gave you cake.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Faves?</h2>
<p><strong>Hannah:</strong> The two standout workshops for me, personally, were fantasy novelist <a href="http://tompollock.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Tom Pollock&#8217;s</strong></a> creative writing workshop on Making Monsters &#8211; which generated at least one idea I&#8217;m going to be writing into a short story. </p>
<p>&#8220;Also, <a href="http://www.enewman.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>Emma Newman</strong></a> ran a workshop on &#8216;Fear and Writing&#8217; &#8211; drawing on <a href="http://www.enewman.co.uk/writing/the-writers-rutter/when-just-write-is-not-enough" target="_blank">her own experiences as an author</a>. </p>
<p>&#8220;Two takeaway things for me were her describing procrastination as a fear-based behaviour, and<br />
that perfectionism is fear&#8217;s favourite coat. Emma &#8211; thank you. That stuff really spoke to me. Like, more than my shrink does.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Hannah:</strong> &#8220;And since it wasn&#8217;t &#8216;here&#8217;s the gay corner&#8217; it felt much more open to (say) the B and the T and the Q sections. Which &#8211; as a bi girl &#8211; I found very, very refreshing.&#8221; </p>
<p><strong>Stephen:</strong> &#8220;On the Friday night I went to a swordfighting workshop with Miltos Yerolemou, the actor who played Syrio Forel in <strong>Game of Thrones</strong>. </p>
<p>&#8220;It was a <em>lot</em> of fun, and at least two thirds of the attendees were women (one of whom was you, Viktoriya, and I totally clocked your expression of demonic glee when you got to swing a very large wooden sword, which suggested you enjoyed the session!).&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Viktoriya:</strong> &#8220;I loved that there was a knitting track, and a <strong>My Little Pony</strong> track, and a board games track. It stressed the diversity of interests that are brought together under the fandom and geek umbrellas in a way that cannot be present in any single-show or single-theme convention. </p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that the &#8216;celebrity guests&#8217; were actually there for panels, activities and workshops primarily, with singing autographs very much a secondary activity, was even better. I despair of the autograph factories modern conventions have become. Queueing for eight hours is not my idea of fun.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Could-do-betters?</h2>
<p><strong>Viktoriya:</strong> &#8220;Well, OK, let me argue with myself for a little bit. I&#8217;m going to nitpick here, not out of anger but because the organisers have shown a genuine interest in learning from their mistakes and in improving the experience in coming years.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, accessibility. I don&#8217;t know what the experience was for those attendees with limited mobility, but I am relatively able-bodied and even I found it a bit cumbersome navigating the stairs in two hotels with only the few lifts. </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Ultimately, that’s what I’m looking for in a convention: committing to doing better next time when mistakes are made.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Some of the multimedia was a little difficult to engage with without risking pain &#8211; strobe lighting, very loud soundscape, and so on. </p>
<p>&#8220;Bringing in a general warning system (a sign on the door?) of strobe lighting for those affected by it, and doing a soundcheck before launching the sound and leaving it at whatever level, would be good.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Stephen:</strong> &#8220;I went to the board games hotel only briefly, and there were lots of steep stairs, but then that&#8217;s the one used for loads of much bigger cons, so I&#8217;m sure they must have a solution in place?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Viktoriya:</strong> &#8220;Well, big cons tend to have a like it or lump it policy. They have priority queuing for fans with mobility issues, but that&#8217;s about it as far as I&#8217;m aware. Individual cons may have a better provision, but I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then there&#8217;s the issue of diversity in organisers and session leads. Part of this is maybe due to the fact that it was the first Nine Worlds, but the organisers, session leads and attendees were overwhelmingly white. </p>
<p>&#8220;Take the panel on <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2013/nineworlds/scmcwd/" target="_blank">Problematic Issues</a> &#8211; some odd things were said during this sessions, and it was also an entirely white panel (so discussing representations of race was rather awkward). I think it was trying to cover too many fandom issues: racism in fanfic and fandom, fetishing gay sex, writing male characters and ignoring female ones, reaffirming heteronormative norms, etc. In an hour.</p>
<p>&#8220;Contrast this with the <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2013/nineworlds/scmdgy/ " target="_blank">Racefail 101 panel</a> in the Books track, which brought together awesome writers of colour to focus on writing characters of colour, and seeking out writers of colour.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given the number of tracks and the number of organisers required, I&#8217;d suggest that the lead organisers work on diversifying the track leads.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;With accessibility, big cons tend to have a like-it-or-lump-it policy. They have priority queuing for fans with mobility issues, but often that’s about it.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p> &#8220;Finally, I disagree with Steve on the inclusiveness extended to the Bronies, mostly because in the sessions I was present at, they were frequently the butt of the joke. </p>
<p>&#8220;Fundamentally, I think it&#8217;s uncool to include something as a track (and therefore give implicit approval of its existence) and then spend the weekend being a bit weirded out by it. I don&#8217;t claim to be part of the MLP fandom, but I thought it was a bit harsh.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Stephen:</strong> &#8220;I didn&#8217;t see the panels where Bronies were mocked, but I did see a lot of people commenting out loud that this was their first experience of them and they thought Bronies were awesome.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Viktoriya:</strong> &#8220;I wonder if part of it isn&#8217;t a reflexive &#8216;let&#8217;s build a hierarchy&#8217; instinct. Certainly there was that feeling at times at the fanfic panels, and some of the comments re: board gaming from attendees. The Bronies were the only ones where I heard panellists commenting on it, though, and there is <a href="http://mechanicalhamster.wordpress.com/2013/08/12/a-great-geekend-part-1-friday/#more-906" target="_blank">some evidence that attendees felt a bit singled out</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What I do think is great is that the organisers of the Problematic Issues panel realised what had gone wrong, and have <a href="http://ladymoonray.livejournal.com/875717.html" target="_blank">publically acknowledged it</a> and committed to doing better next time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ultimately, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m looking for in a convention. There were a few tweeted mentions of positive and negative feedback (which, to their credit, the Nine Worlds twitter feed retweeted).&#8221;</p>
<h2>Let&#8217;s wrap this up&#8230;</h2>
<p><strong>Hannah:</strong> &#8220;I think everyone involved understands it was a first attempt at a huge thing and the learning curve was, and will continue to be, pretty damn steep – but I couldn’t be prouder to be a part of it or more excited about next year.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Viktoriya:</strong> &#8220;Since there&#8217;s a year until the next Nine Worlds I guess I&#8217;ll conclude with some general links on the inclusion and harassment issues &#8211; if you&#8217;re thinking of going to a convention and are concerned about safety, or if you have been harassed at a convention and want to know how to report it, have a look at these resources:</p>
<ul>
<li>Elise Mathesen&#8217;s experience of reporting sexual harassment <a href="http://seanan-mcguire.livejournal.com/517984.html" target="_blank">here</a>, including a contact and resource list for reporting it <a href="http://www.jimchines.com/2013/07/reporting-sexual-harassment-2013/" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
<li>Carrie Cuinn&#8217;s experiences and guide for reporting are <a href="http://carriecuinn.com/2013/06/30/please-stop-touching-my-breasts-and-other-things-i-say-at-cons/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://carriecuinn.com/2013/07/02/sexual-harassment-at-cons-part-2-how-to-stop-it-and-other-thoughts/" target="_blank">here</a> </li>
<li>Finally, the odious Ted Beale was recently finally expelled from <a href="http://www.locusmag.com/News/2013/08/beale-expelled-from-sfwa/" target="_blank">SFWA</a>. NK Jemisin has written <a href="http://nkjemisin.com/2013/08/time-to-pick-a-side/" target="_blank">a blisteringy on-point post</a> on racism and misogyny in SFF, Beale&#8217;s expulsion, and the behaviour which led to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;Most of all, I loved the fact that I enjoyed Nine Worlds so much, I have already decided I&#8217;m going next year. No uncertainty, no hmm-maybe and oh-yes-perhaps. I&#8217;m going next year because it was wonderful. How can you argue with that?&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m hoping this&#8217;ll be the start of an all-new series on Bad Reputation, where I delve into a misunderstood, secretive, or just slightly odd subculture. Today, we’re going to start with bronies.</p>
<h2 id="originofspecies">Origin of Species</h2>
<p>Let’s start with a little background.</p>
<p>Once upon a time (1982), in a marketing meeting far, far away (Rhode Island), Hasbro decided to take on the My Little Pony intellectual property. They marketed it pretty much exclusively at girls. The toys were sold with world-shakingly innovative features such as brushable hair and a unique mark on each character’s butt.</p>
<p>The theme continued with a couple of animated series &#8211; in which the ponies partook in such riveting activities as going to school and dating &#8211; and even a feature film. This was pretty standard stuff for Hasbro, who had long since realised the value of getting kids involved with a cartoon. My Little Pony continued on form, with few variations on the core premise, until 2010.</p>
<h2 id="mylittlepony:friendshipismagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</h2>
<p>Everything changed in 2010. Lauren Faust, animator supreme, was roused from her cryogenic slumber. Her mission: to turn a tedious, gender essentialist franchise into something that would break gender boundaries and interest a whole new generation in animated ponies with magical tattoos.</p>
<p>There’s also the horse porn fanart, but we’ll get onto that later.</p>
<p>Faust lists the things that she hopes to achive with MLP:FiM in her <a href="http://msmagazine.com/blog/blog/2010/12/24/my-little-non-homophobic-non-racist-non-smart-shaming-pony-a-rebuttal">Ms. Magazine article about the issue</a>. To quote &#8211;</p>
<blockquote><p>There are lots of different ways to be a girl.</p>
<p>[&#8230;] This show is wonderfully free of “token girl” syndrome, so there is no pressure to shove all the ideals of what we want our daughters to be into one package.</p>
<p>[&#8230;] Cartoons for girls don’t have to be a puddle of smooshy, cutesy-wootsy, goody-two-shoeness. Girls like stories with real conflict; girls are smart enough to understand complex plots; girls aren’t as easily frightened as everyone seems to think. Girls are complex human beings, and they can be brave, strong, kind and independent–but they can also be uncertain, awkward, silly, arrogant or stubborn. They shouldn’t have to succumb to pressure to be perfect.</p>
<p>Yes, My Little Pony is riddled with pink, the leader is a Princess instead of a Queen and there probably aren’t enough boys around to portray a realistic society. These decisions were not entirely up to me. It has been a challenge to balance my personal ideals with my bosses’ needs for toy sales and good ratings. [&#8230;] There is also a need to incorporate fashion play into the show, but only one character is interested in it and she is not a trend follower but a designer who sells her own creations from her own store. We portray her not as a shopaholic but as an artist.</p></blockquote>
<p>Lauren Faust, I think I love you. And, apparently, I’m not the only one. MLP:FiM gained a <em>fucking enormous</em> audience, across all gender identities. For example, let’s take a look at this video.</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/zNryNfvcQlY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p> ;</p>
<p><em>Just fucking look at it.</em></p>
<h2 id="rightgoodsowhatactuallyisabrony">Right, good, so what actually IS a Brony?</h2>
<p>Wikipedia will know, right?</p>
<blockquote><p>Brony is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Krzyżanów, within Kutno County, Łódź Voivodeship, in central Poland. It lies approximately 12 kilometres (7 mi) south of Kutno and 40 km (25 mi) north of the regional capital Łódź.</p></blockquote>
<p>No, probably not. Let’s try Urban Dictionary and ignore anything referring to a sex act or requiring specialist equipment. It might take a while.</p>
<blockquote><p>A name typically given to the male viewers/fans (whether they are straight, gay, bisexual, etc.) of the My Little Pony show or franchise. They typically do not give in to the hype that males aren’t allowed to enjoy things that may be intended for females.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s better. Pretty accurate, too, though I understand that it’s not a gender-specific term (so pay attention to the word ‘typically’ there).</p>
<p>So what do bronies care about? Why are they bronies? I wouldn’t dream of putting uninformed words in their mouths. I went digging for some My Little Pony forums, and put out a little questionnaire via <a href="https://twitter.com/syn/status/215835928499994625">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/comments/vdxv4/im_writing_an_article_about_bronies_its_not_a/">Reddit’s /r/mylittlepony</a>.</p>
<p>I didn’t have much luck finding any insights on the forums, but I found this post very sweet…</p>
<p align="center"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/brony-seeking-question.png"><img loading="lazy" style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="brony-seeking-question" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/brony-seeking-question_thumb.png?resize=590%2C182" alt="brony-seeking-question: screenshot of a forum post asking: have you ever been out in public and found out someone's a brony? did you talk to them about the show? if not, would you like to?'" width="590" height="182" border="0" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>…and this reply absolutely hilarious when taken out of context…</p>
<p align="center"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/brony-seeking-reply.png"><img loading="lazy" style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="brony-seeking-reply" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/brony-seeking-reply_thumb.png?resize=414%2C73" alt="Screenshot reading 'I have seen on many occasions strangers with pony gear on.'" width="414" height="73" border="0" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>…but I digress. I digress pervily, but it’s definitely digression. Let’s move on to the questionnaire.</p>
<h2 id="thebroniesspeak">The Bronies Speak</h2>
<h3 id="whatisyourgenderidentity">“What is your gender identity?”</h3>
<p align="center"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/gender.png"><img loading="lazy" style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="gender" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/gender_thumb.png?resize=365%2C260" alt="bar chart showing gender of respondents: men are in the lead." width="365" height="260" border="0" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>I discovered after putting the questionnaire online that some female MLP fans call themselves “pegasisters”, so there’s potential selection bias in the results. Still, it validates what I was hoping for &#8211; that the majority of responses were coming from the male-identified side of the fandom.<sup><a href="/2012/08/08/adventures-in-subcultures-the-bronies/#footnote_0_11390" id="identifier_0_11390" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" Ed&rsquo;s tiny note: I&rsquo;m wondering how our trans* readers may feel about the way we&rsquo;ve differentiated our categories here. On reflection, it might have been more inclusive to label the &ldquo;male&rdquo; and &ldquo;female&rdquo; categories &ldquo;cis&rdquo;. We did want to avoid any implication that someone who is trans* cannot simply have access to the general terms of &ldquo;male&rdquo; or &ldquo;female&rdquo; &ndash; this is not a view we hold! &ndash; but we may not have succeeded, and it&rsquo;s just as arguable here that we&rsquo;ve done the opposite.

<h3 id="wereyouafanofthemylittleponyfranchisebeforefriendshipismagicstarted">“Were you a fan of the My Little Pony franchise before Friendship is Magic started?”</h3>
<p align="center"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/fanbefore.png"><img loading="lazy" style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="fanbefore" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/fanbefore_thumb.png?resize=365%2C170" alt="pie chart with a majority of No answers" width="365" height="170" border="0" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>The community seems to be nearly exclusively focused on the new iteration of My Little Pony, without any pre-existing interest in the older material.</p>
<h3 id="wouldyoubehappyformostorallofthepeopleyouknowtoknowthatyouidentifyasabrony">“Would you be happy for most or all of the people you know to know that you identify as a brony?”</h3>

<p>The number of positive responses to this surprised me. MLP fans get a hard time online, and it can only be worse in meatspace. Perhaps the show’s message of love and tolerance results in a more optimistic viewpoint, or attracts those already predisposed to one.</p>
<h3 id="whatappealstoyouabouttheshowitself">“What appeals to you about the show itself?”</h3>
<blockquote><p>I thoroughly enjoy the idea that a show can be feminine, and ‘made for girls’, without being an overblown, over-prissy tea party. The deconstruction of gender binary and gender stereotypes present in the show is admirable and wonderful.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– anon</em></p>
<blockquote><p>It is refreshing to see a show, even amongst children’s programming, that is completely lacking in cynicism. The show and the characters within it are un-selfconciously idealistic and positive. It provides fantastic role models for children of all genders, and the world it has built feels rich and fully occupied.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– Tim (@trivia_lad)</em></p>
<blockquote><p>The entire show just feels right. When I’m watching MLP:FiM, it’s like I’m a kid again and I can enjoy the childishness of the entire thing without care.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– Shawn X (@shawnyall)</em></p>
<blockquote><p>The character diversity (for once in a children’s show, the fashionable one isn’t the bad guy) and I’m a sucker for the innocent humour included. The characters also have tragic (in the classical sense of the word) flaws: the representative of loyalty is self-centered, the representative of generosity manipulative, and when the representative of Kindness gets mad, even the Hulk would tell her to calm down.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– anon</em></p>
<h3 id="whatdoyoudislikeorresentabouttheshowitself">“What do you dislike or resent about the show itself?”</h3>
<p>The vast majority of responses to this question were “nothing, nada, zero”. It seems the community is generally very happy with the show.</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s a shame Faust had to leave, season 2 was a very different show compared to the first and even though it’s still good something felt like it was missing. I attribute that to Faust’s absence.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– Bret (@the_red_bobcat)</em></p>
<blockquote><p>Although strong, not-even-slightly sexualised female role models are a wonderful thing, I am not wholly comfortable with the representation of male characters in the show. With only one or two exceptions, male ponies are represented as stupid, or comic foils, with roles that tend to be service occupations. Unless an episode requires a stallion MacGuffin (See: a Canterlot Wedding, where you get a male character of high social status, though he is very easily manipulated by a strong, evil female character).</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– MiaVee (@MiaVee)</em></p>
<h3 id="whatareyouparticularlyproudofaboutthebronycommunitywhatdoyouenjoyaboutbeingpartofit">“What are you particularly proud of about the brony community? What do you enjoy about being part of it?”</h3>
<blockquote><p>I’m proud of what we do. We start charities, we raise money, we’re so united and loving. Really, I enjoy the love in the brony community. Everyone is just so understanding, caring, and enjoyable. When I first started watching and putting myself into the community, I didn’t know what to expect. But as I opened up more and more, they accepted me without question. They gave my life an entire new part to enjoy, and changed me forever.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– Shawn X (@shawnyall)</em></p>
<blockquote><p>I particularly enjoy the community’s openness towards almost every type of person (at least this is true for the Reddit section).</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– anon</em></p>
<blockquote><p>I am proud of the grown men who are not ashamed of watching a girls’ show just because it is for girls. I like the “love and tolerate” message and the lack of outright trolls.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– Meghan E</em></p>
<blockquote><p>I think one of the strongest indications of how the brony community aren’t all creepy, socially inept, hygiene-incapable, sexual predators is the eagerness of the producers and actors on the show to engage with them. The Hub ident produced to promote the second series, a reskin of Katy Perry’s “California Girls” called “Equestria Girls” gives a shout out to bronies, Tara Strong on Twitter actively engages with bronies (as does Andrea Libman, to a smaller extent).</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– MiaVee (@MiaVee)</em></p>
<h3 id="whatnegativeexperienceshaveyouhadorknownaboutinthebronycommunitywhatwouldyouchangeifyoucould">“What negative experiences have you had or known about in the brony community? What would you change if you could?”</h3>
<blockquote><p>The only real negative experience that I’ve known about is the discrimination against a sub-section of bronies called ‘cloppers’ &#8211; people who fantasize/look at lewd pictures of characters from the show. The cloppers themselves don’t bother me &#8211; it’s the fact that most of the fandom acts like it’s this skeleton in the closet and are extremely ashamed of it, when really it’s not a big deal.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– Rpspartin (@rpspartin)</em></p>
<blockquote><p><em></em>Anything involving shipping. No no no no no just stop. The show is cute and fine without shoehorning madeup lesbian relationships.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– anon</em></p>
<blockquote><p>The only bad times I’ve seen are all the haters that continue to try to bully us. But I wouldn’t change anything. Some of these people just need a friend and we’re more than happy to be that.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– no name provided</em></p>
<blockquote><p>Having people approach you and say “My Little Pony? Are you an 8 year old girl?” is part of being a brony, but you can live with it because once you tell them to watch the show it’s an amazing feeling to have that same person come back to you and say “Yeah, sorry bro. That show is amazing!”. Anything that’s rock and roll enough for Andrew W.K. (who’s hosting a “What Would Pinkie Pie Do?” talk) is rock and roll enough for me!</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– Bret (@the_red_bobcat)</em></p>
<blockquote><p>There is still a lot of misogyny and ableism. Many bronies seem to think that because it’s good, it can’t possibly be for girls, and thus deny that it’s a girls’ show. Alternatively, many get offended when it’s called a girls’ show because they still equate “girly” with ’bad.“ I’d rather seem them embracing the girliness of it, and responding ”yes, it’s for girls, because girls are awesome. Everything for girls should be this awesome.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– Meghan E.</em></p>
<blockquote><p>I’m reluctant to use the term “brony” to describe myself because in every corner of the internet are snarky non-fans seeking to smear every adult fan of the show [&#8230;] as a fandom overall it seems a lot more welcoming, gentle and understanding than the elitist bullcrap you can get around diehard fangirls and boys for any other show/game/movie.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– MiaVee (@MiaVee)</em></p>
<h3 id="freetexttimetellmewhateveryouthinkthatishouldknow.triviagossipyounameit.thisisyourmoment.">“Free text time! Tell me whatever you think that I should know. Trivia, gossip, you name it. This is your moment.”</h3>
<blockquote><p>The brony community is huge, and rapidly growing. Like any other community of fans, it is impossible to define the composition, interests, and behavior of its members succinctly. I’d ask, gently, that you please keep this in mind while writing your article.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– anon</em></p>
<blockquote><p>I became a slightly more positive and confident person by watching the show.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– anon</em></p>
<blockquote><p>All ponies are equal, but some ponies are more equal than others, including Rarity exclusively.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– DocTavia</em></p>
<blockquote><p>Rarity is best pony. Anyone who says otherwise is just jealous they aren’t as fabulous</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– anon</em></p>
<blockquote><p>The only thing I request is that it be made known that Rarity is easily my favourite.</p></blockquote>

<h2 id="whatdidwelearn">&#8220;The Derpy Controversy&#8221;</h2>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/derpy.png"><img loading="lazy" style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: right; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="derpy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/derpy_thumb.png?resize=260%2C199" alt="derpy" width="260" height="199" align="right" border="0" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Derpy Hooves is what&#8217;s called a &#8216;background pony&#8217;. She appeared in the crowd in one of the early episodes, and her unusual eyes earned her an instant cult following in the MLP fandom.</p>
<p>Ever attentive to their fans, Lauren Faust and the rest of the team decided to put Derpy in more prominent positions, and even give her a few lines.</p>
<p>This prompted a few equality-minded fans to complain &#8211; &#8216;derpy&#8217; being a <a href="http://genderbitch.tumblr.com/post/1005199855/conclusions-the-word-derp-and-variations">reference</a> to presentations of learning disability. From One Survivor To Another <a href="http://fromonesurvivortoanother.tumblr.com/post/15821397354/trigger-warning-ableism-ableist-slurs-an-open">wrote an open letter to Lauren Faust</a> on the issue, and <a href="http://fromonesurvivortoanother.tumblr.com/post/16423096962/tw-ableism-rape-culture-common-arguments-on-the">followed up with a smackdown</a> to many of the privilege-tastic counter-arguments that were made.</p>
<p>A modified version of the episode featuring Derpy was released on iTunes with &#8216;fixed&#8217; eyes; however, the original version was contained in the DVD release.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to get into the rights and wrongs of this one here &#8211; you can <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/derpy-hooves">read more about Derpy Hooves&#8217; history on Know Your Meme</a> if you like &#8211; but my point is simply that there was discourse in the fandom on the matter. There were strong feelings on both sides, but it&#8217;s nice to know that at least the argument could be conducted (mostly) reasonably.</p>
<h2>What did we learn?</h2>
<p>What, other than the fact that anyone who has expressed a preference wanted to be very vocal about their love for Rarity?</p>
<p>Well, it seems that the MLP fandom are <em>extremely</em> accepting. “Love and tolerance” &#8211; a term so popular that I presume it’s from the show &#8211; is paramount. We’ve seen this before, in communities like furries and otherkin. Don’t get me wrong &#8211; it’s an admirable trait &#8211; but it does lend itself to being accepting of the extremes of the community without significantly challenging them. Deserving or undeserving, that’s something that can get a community a bad name in general.</p>
<p>There is an undeniable degree of childish naïveté in the community. Potentially expected due to the nature of the show, it does seem to result in marginalising those who ‘clop’ or enjoy fanart/fanfic of the characters in adult situations. Controversial one, this, and this is only a personal view &#8211; but I see it as slightly odd but harmless. The fanart and fanfic are drawn and written, and so they don’t harm any real person. If someone wants to pat their flanks to imaginary ponies in compromising scenarios, it doesn’t harm anyone else.</p>
<p>The community seems to revel in the fact that the production team for the show is interested in what they care about, and are willing to name or give cameos to formerly nameless ‘background ponies’ that gain popularity with their fandom.</p>
<p>Bronies &#8211; and the ‘pegasisters’ that I’m sorry to have neglected in the survey &#8211; seem to be, on the whole, genuinely lovely people that just so happen to like cartoon ponies. Is their fandom a bit strange? Sure. That said, though, how many fandoms aren’t?</p>
<p>And now, if you don’t mind, I’m going to watch the first few episodes of the first season. It might be terrible &#8211; it might be great. What I’m fairly certain of, though, is that it’s not going to piss me off.</p>

<p>Age old question, really, this one, and one where &#8220;want&#8221; and &#8220;need&#8221; are often made unhelpfully interchangable, just to make it EVEN SIMPLER.</p>
<p>Welcome back to Feminist TwitBomb, Deluxe Edition, in which we take a sexist <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/02/02/why-are-trending-topic-hashtags-so-sexist-part-1/">Twitter</a> <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/02/03/why-are-trending-topic-hashtags-so-sexist-part-2/">hashtag</a> and try and make it slightly less soul-harrowingly bleak by exploring its inherent absurdity, usually with caps lock, bad puns, and the sudden appearance of wildlife. Previously on this channel: how <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/04/02/found-feminism-fun-with-tips-for-ladies/"><strong>#TipsForLadies</strong> was skewered</a>.</p>

<li><strong>1993: </strong>Tammy Wynette <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQv6zls6sw">warbled</a> &#8220;a ring on my finger and champagne on ice&#8221; at Elton John in a song helpfully titled <strong>A Woman&#8217;s Needs</strong>; if you are lucky enough to have these items to hand, I advise you to down the entire bottle before you try to listen.</li>
<li><strong>1999:</strong> Even Christina Aguilera <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpspGHeLOPE">is disappointingly lyrically coy about it</a> &#8211; the song is originally titled <strong>What A Girl Needs</strong> and renamed to <em>Wants</em> by the record label execs. FOR FEMINISM, I assume. (Either way, apparently the answer is &#8220;whatever her dude wants her to want/need&#8221;).</li>

<p>PROBLEMATIC, as <a href="http://isthisfeminist.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> might say.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all fine, though, guys, because TWITTER TO THE RESCUE. Eat your heart out, Sigmund, Xtina and Geoff, for the question will now be answered.</p>
<h2>#WhatAWomanNeeds</h2>
<p>An initial peek at the feed for this trending topic was a <em>little</em> bit unedifying. I&#8217;ve anonymised the authors because they&#8217;re really only being quoted for background. The fun comes later when you lot get involved.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Curves and long hair&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Does it matter where the hair is? Can it be in my nostrils?</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Endless closet space&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>FOR THE SKULLS OF THE FALLEN.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;a guy who will protect her like she&#8217;s his daughter, love her like she&#8217;s his wife, and respect her like she&#8217;s his mother.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Apart from the fact that many of us do not fancy these things at all (or men), this is a worryingly ambitious MAIDEN-MOTHER-CRONE SUPERCONFLATION, and I am <em>not</em> paying his therapy bill when shit gets too confusing.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;oven mittens&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230; hoo, boy, watch out, sisterhood. This dude&#8217;s a <em>serious</em> wordsmith.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;to meet One Direction&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Ah, shit. *throws up hands* <em>Busted. </em></p>
<p>You get the picture there, anyway: high time, we decided, for a cheering TwitBomb session.</p>

Seriously.

<p>Stellar advice from one of the brilliant <a href="http://www.betterstrangersopera.com/">Better Strangers Opera</a> collective there. (The <a href="http://apocalypsegirlsguide.blogspot.co.uk/">Apocalypse Girls</a> would be proud.)</p>
<p>This next one actually broke into the Top Entries for this hashtag, which I frankly regard as one of my life&#8217;s crowning achievements so far. It&#8217;s sitting there, nestled loudly between Smug &#8220;Oven Mitts&#8221; Guy and Creepy Oedipal Posturings. It&#8217;s ruining the vibe of patronage-and-patronising quite nicely.

A hat trick of pragmatism for us all from our own Markgraf. By the way, this team is never going to conduct a TwitBomb without reference to the noble pheasant at some point. No reason. It&#8217;s just better than ovens, chivalry and sleaze. And when these sorts of ridiculous generalisations continue to be hashtagged, surely anything goes.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[There are a few things that I've decided are never going out of fashion: pirates and zombies.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are a few things that I&#8217;ve decided are never going out of fashion: pirates and zombies.  They&#8217;re ubiquitous.  They&#8217;re <em>everywhere</em>.  Everyone&#8217;s party either wants you to come as one or other or a mixture of the two, or wouldn&#8217;t mind if you did.  This is no bad thing: zombies are obviously a reclamation of the middle-class stigmatisation of the working class as a shambling, faceless, flesh-eating horde, and pirates are &#8230;pirates.  Who wouldn&#8217;t want to be a pirate?  There&#8217;s <em>loads</em> of stuff to like about pirates.  The ships, the clothes, the beards and the array of innovative tropical sexually-acquired infections.  Rum, sodomy and the lash. <em>Anyone&#8217;s</em> idea of fun.</p>
<p><strong>***As is usual, dear readers, the BadRep pirate flag reading SPOILER WARNING &#8211; only mild to moderate this time, but still &#8211; is hereby hoisted here! ***</strong></p>
<p>So, Britain&#8217;s most beloved animation house, <strong>Aardman Animations</strong>, the cheerful cohort behind treasured characters <strong>Wallace &amp; Gromit</strong> and my personal comfort-watchers <a href="http://www.aardman.com/features/released-features/chicken-run/"><strong> Chicken Run</strong></a> and <a href="http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/rex_the_runt/"><strong>Rex The Runt</strong></a>, really can&#8217;t go wrong with a film entitled <strong> The Pirates! In An Adventure With Scientists</strong>.  It&#8217;s adapted from <strong>Gideon Defoe&#8217;s</strong> <a href="http://www.gideondefoe.com/page4.htm">series</a> of childrens&#8217; books of the same name and derivations thereof, one of which is called <strong>The Pirates! In An Adventure With Communists</strong>, and if that doesn&#8217;t make you deliriously excited, then I&#8217;m afraid we can&#8217;t be friends.  I haven&#8217;t read them yet, but I&#8217;ve made arrangements to get them into my eager paws as soon as possible because how can I not?  Pirates!  Everyone likes pirates.</p>
<p>It was the poster that drew my eye first.  Witness:</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/PiratesTeaserPoster.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="10676" data-permalink="/2012/04/16/at-the-movies-the-pirates-in-an-adventure-with-scientists/piratesteaserposter/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/PiratesTeaserPoster.jpg?fit=300%2C444&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="300,444" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="PiratesTeaserPoster" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/PiratesTeaserPoster.jpg?fit=202%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/PiratesTeaserPoster.jpg?fit=300%2C444&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/PiratesTeaserPoster.jpg?resize=300%2C444" alt="The poster for The Pirates! In An Adventure With Scientists. There is a banner at the top showing the title of the film.  The poster design is a sort of cone of people, with the Pirate Captain (a pale-skinned man with a large brown beard) central.  To the left of him, there is a dark-skinned, cunning-looking female pirate with dark hair and a large cutlass.  To his right, also holding his arm, is a pale-skinned femme pirate dressed in pastel colours with a large, ginger beard.  Beneath them, there are assorted other characters, such as Queen VIctoria, looking vicious and making an &quot;Off with his head&quot; gesture with her hands, and a pirate that looks rather like Elvis, only a pirate.  There is also a mermaid, a galleon, a monkey in a suit, a heap of gold and two cannons.  Assorted pirates and Charles Darwin populate the frame of the image, dangling off airships.

<p><em>PIRATES!</em> it says.  And there they are.  There&#8217;s a nice representation of different genders, ages, ethnicities and beards on the poster, and I was all excited for a nice diverse film &#8211; the sort I tend to dream about.</p>
<p>SHAME IT&#8217;S A LIE.</p>
<p>Well, no, I&#8217;m exaggerating &#8211; it&#8217;s not quite a bare-faced man-churned fictivated sin-speech, but it&#8217;s pretty fallacious.  The main character is that chap in the middle there, the Pirate Captain (<strong>Hugh Grant</strong>).  The pirate to the left of him, Cutlass Liz &#8211; voiced by the brilliant <strong>Salma Hayek</strong> &#8211; is an award-winning Pirate Of The Year, full of swash, buckle and plunder-power, and gets <em>literally no screen-time in which she isn&#8217;t a sex object.</em>  Seriously.  She turns up, wiggles, alludes to her piratical prowess and then&#8230; isn&#8217;t seen again!  She has, like, three scenes!  And one of them is in the dreams of the Pirate Captain where she&#8217;s all, &#8220;Ooh Pirate Captain, I am UNDONE&#8221;.</p>
<p>The pirate to the right of said Pirate Captain in the poster goes by the moniker Suspiciously Curvaceous Pirate (they&#8217;re all &#8220;[Adjective] Pirate&#8221;). Voiced by <strong>Ashley Jensen</strong>, she&#8217;s a dragged-up pirate with an amazing false beard and a sweet Scottish chirp &#8211; who also gets very little screen-time or lines, and whose characterisation appears to revolve around the fact that she likes sparkly jewels, pastel colours and fancies the captain a bit.  The humour of her character is almost exclusively that she&#8217;s a cross-dressing woman.  Now, I&#8217;m never okay with boys in drag being sent up purely for being boys in drag, so why would I be okay with it if the character&#8217;s female?</p>
<p>Not great, is it?</p>
<p>That said, it&#8217;s not all bad news for lady characters in this, but from a rather unexpected source: the villain, voiced by the legendary <strong>Imelda Staunton</strong>, Queen Victoria (&#8220;Look at my crest! What does it say?  I HATE PIRATES.&#8221;) is absolutely magnificent.  She&#8217;s perfect.  Stop making that face.  This is the badassest Queen Vic you have <em>ever</em> seen, and I don’t think it’s possible to not fancy her even a little bit after the credits roll.  She has a <em>battle skirt</em> that clanks aside to reveal a) jodphurs and b) TWO KATANAS.  Come <em>on</em>.  How many other films have had Queen Victoria fighting pirates with katanas before getting vanquished by GCSE-classroom science?  FUCKING ZERO.  THIS IS A UNIQUE CINEMATOGRAPHICAL EXPERIENCE.</p>
<p>OVERALL, the above issues aside, it&#8217;s a very funny film &#8211; the school of humour whereby if one joke doesn&#8217;t wash with you, never fear! there&#8217;ll be another one along in a tick &#8211; and it&#8217;s rich with classic Aardman background detail (the pirate ship has a fusebox, for example, and watch the faces of the taxidermy animals in Charles Darwin&#8217;s (<strong>David Tennant</strong>) house during the bathtub chase scene!).  <strong>Martin Freeman&#8217;s</strong> second-in-command pirate actually looks a bit like him, which is neatly appealing, and <strong>Brian Blessed&#8217;s</strong> megaphonic turn as the Pirate King is predictably godlike.  The dodo is gorgeously animated.  I wish there&#8217;d been more scientists doing science-y things, but then I was imagining something dreadful involving shiny gloves, tailored labcoats and experimentation, and there are reasons I haven&#8217;t been allowed to make films for children and <em>that&#8217;s one of them.</em></p>
<p>But I did make a new poster, to give the neglected characters just a bit more attention. I made Cutlass Liz look a bit more badass, too, on account of her being badass and therefore deserving of a badass coat:</p>

Above his head, there is a banner reading, &quot;WHAT AM I DOING HERE&quot;.  Behind him, there is a small cannon.  It is labelled with a banner reading, &quot;CANNONS!&quot;  Beneath the three figures, there is a large, green sea-serpent coiled into the bottom left (a banner next to it reads, &quot;MONSTERS!&quot;, and a man in a crown with a large beard in the bottom right.

THERE. </p>
<h3>YOU SHOULD SEE THIS FILM BECAUSE:</h3>
<ul>
<li> The best Queen Victoria you have literally ever seen</li>
<li>It&#8217;s really painfully funny</li>
<li>Who doesn&#8217;t want to see Brian Blessed being a pirate king, seriously</li>
<li>There&#8217;s Flight Of The Concords on the soundtrack!</li>
<li>Thank god for stop-motion claymation &#8211; surely the finest animation technique ever? THIS HOUSE BELIEVES: YES</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>YOU SHOULD NOT SEE THIS FILM BECAUSE:</h3>
<ul>
<li>It promises a lot in the trailer and poster in terms of ethnic/gender representation and then doesn&#8217;t deliver</li>
<li>I frankly wanted more science</li>
<li>And more Brian Blessed</li>
<li>More of everything that wasn&#8217;t the cis/white/male lead characters, actually, I mean they were great and all but I&#8217;m bored of cis/white/men being the&#8230; we&#8217;ve already had this discussion, internet, leave me be</li>

					<description><![CDATA[How the trending topic "Tips for Ladies" became fun as opposed to vom-inducing.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oh, Twitter. So often a place where humanity can flourish &#8211; the instant revealing of oppression or fraud that governments try to hide, news topics trending days before the major channels are brave enough to jump in &#8211; but it&#8217;s also a pit of despair for feminists on a depressingly regular basis.</p>
<p>Last week&#8217;s example was the trending topic &#8220;Tips for Ladies&#8221;. The online world took this tremendous opportunity to help guide women through life by posting thousands of tweets featuring the words &#8216;cooking&#8217;, &#8216;cleaning&#8217;, &#8216;clothes&#8217; and advice on how to be more sexually available to men, all with exciting new adventures in spelling and grammar. (Don&#8217;t search for it. Just don&#8217;t. Your brain doesn&#8217;t need the trauma). Okay, look, here&#8217;s one at random and you can take my word for it that there are many pages of similar entries:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>#TipsForLadies</strong> Cooking and Cleaning up does not make you a good woman.Your suppose to do that.</p></blockquote>
<p>(I choose to read this as <em>&#8220;Following society&#8217;s bullshit gender roles won&#8217;t make you a magnificent person &#8211; YOU are the one who must strive to transform yourself.&#8221;</em> I choose to interpret it like this, because otherwise I would turn to drink most days.)</p>
<p>But then&#8230;</p>
<p>Then I noticed something new. It started small and grew as the rebellion began&#8230; BadRep&#8217;s very own <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/Hannah_Chutzpah"><strong>Hannah Chutzpah</strong></a> brought the first one to my attention:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/misselliemae"><strong>@MissEllieMae</strong></a><br />
<strong>#TipsForLadies</strong> Remember, when enacting nuclear fusion, the nickel isotope is more stable than the iron isotope.</p></blockquote>
<p>I decided to write one of my own:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>#TipsForLadies</strong> CERN&#8217;s results where neutrino speed appeared to break relativity were probably due to relativistic motion of the GPS clocks.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Markgraf</strong> weighed in:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>#TipsForLadies</strong> Pheasants are easy both to capture and domesticate.</p></blockquote>
<p>But it wasn&#8217;t just Team BadRep on the case.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>@prattprattpratt</strong><br />
The way to a man&#8217;s heart is not through his stomach&#8230; unless your sword is kinda bendy upwards. <strong>#TipsForLadies</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>@GRILLEVERYTHING</strong><br />
<strong>#TipsForLadies</strong> When battling Gorgons, avoid turning into stone by only viewing your foe through a reflective surface.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/MsBathtub"><strong>@MsBathtub</strong></a><br />
<strong>#tipsforladies</strong> The ability to start a fire can mean the difference between life &amp; death in survival situations.</p></blockquote>
<p>(Ms Bathtub also <a href="http://www.twitlonger.com/show/glk28m">quoted Rilke</a>).</p>
<p>And another from Ellie Mae:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>@MissEllieMae</strong><br />
<strong>#TipsForLadies</strong> Join a union. You&#8217;ll get paid more and have better working conditions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Even Darth Vader&#8217;s PR team got in on the act:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/deathstarpr"><strong>@DeathStarPR</strong></a><br />
<strong>#TipsForLadies</strong> Don&#8217;t be a Bella Swan when you could be a Princess Leia. <strong>#StarWars</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I felt a little better. <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/category/category-found-feminism/">Found Feminism</a> is often about finding voices <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/07/19/found-feminism-how-i-stopped-worrying-and-learned-to-say-no-to-the-special-k-lady/">fighting back in unexpected places</a>, and that&#8217;s exactly what I hope people take away from this. In the online environment, we are surrounded by people too young, inexperienced or just plain bigoted to spread anything but the easiest, most poisonous dreck society has to peddle. The answer is to speak up. <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/04/07/found-feminism-%E2%80%9Cthings-starbuck-wouldn%E2%80%99t-say%E2%80%9D-by-katee-sackhoff/">Use comedy</a>, use popular trends, but even if it&#8217;s just you and just once, speak up for equality. And we&#8217;ll leave little beacons of hope in the places most easily reached by the most people.</p>
<p>Twitter <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/02/02/why-are-trending-topic-hashtags-so-sexist-part-1/">is regularly</a> a hopeless <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/02/03/why-are-trending-topic-hashtags-so-sexist-part-2/">mess of misogyny</a> &#8211; I could pick a new trending topic every week.</p>
<p>That just means we have to engage with it MORE.</p>

<p>Pixar&#8217;s first full length movie with a female protagonist is less than four months away from release. And, <a href="http://io9.com/5887598/watch-the-first-scene-from-pixars-brave-now">as io9 reported last week</a>, the first scene is now previewable:</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/JOmc2GzWtSE" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>I&#8217;m really excited. ENGAGE INITIAL BURBLE-O-METER:</p>
<h3>HURRAH!</h3>
<ul>
<li>I remain so, so pleased to see a Pixar movie from the point of view of a girl character. Without exception, the entire Pixar canon &#8211; which I&#8217;m a huge, boxset-toting, scene-quoting fan of, for the record &#8211; features male protagonists, and while <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessie_(Toy_Story)">Jessie</a>, <a href="http://pixar.wikia.com/Dory">Dory</a>, and <a href="http://pixar.wikia.com/Ellie_Fredricksen">Ellie</a> (who determines much of <strong>Up</strong>&#8216;s story even though it&#8217;s via her absence) are all fun and compelling sidekick or partner characters, I&#8217;ve been waiting for Pixar to place a female character centre-stage. And now, after over 20 years, we&#8217;ve got one in the shape of Princess Merida, headstrong Scottish medieval archery whizz. </li>
<li>Placing a female character centre-stage, of course, is not the be-all and end-all. Disney&#8217;s been doing it for years with their fairytale movies and resultant &#8220;princess&#8221; brand. They&#8217;ve finally brought the curtain down on their run of &#8220;princess&#8221; films with 2010&#8217;s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0398286/"><strong>Tangled</strong></a>, which I thought was charmingly smart, sassy and very happy, to a point, to send up its own canon. But it still operated very much within the constraints of that canon &#8211; it was, in places, a bit like <strong>Legally Blonde</strong> in Fairytale Land &#8211; and I&#8217;m hoping this will bust the box open juuuust a bit more.</li>
<h3>BROW-FURROW!</h3>
<li>I think it&#8217;s interesting that Pixar have chosen, as far as I can tell, to make their first girl-POV movie begin from a starting problem of an arranged marriage tradition, and the synopsis as it stands (it&#8217;s on the io9 page) hints that they&#8217;re going with Little Mermaid-style tropes of &#8220;headstrong young woman consults wise woman for advice to avoid patriarchal problem; things go wrong&#8221;, and so on. Being critical for just a moment, I do think it would be good in the end to get to a Disney/Pixar film where female characters are not lone figures in a world of predominantly male characters, or on quests where the aim is to fight the male status quo. Or as one commenter on io9 put it, &#8220;I&#8217;m still waiting for the movie about the girl who doesn&#8217;t have to prove she&#8217;s awesome or that she&#8217;s as good as boys&#8221;. It makes me want to cheer and bounce off my chair when Merida fires that final arrow in front of all those shocked dudes, but I&#8217;d also quite like to just see her &#8230; go on a quest that isn&#8217;t about Defying Sexism. Lone Female Crusaders are all over our screens with relative frequency, from <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/03/23/at-the-movies-true-grit/"><strong>True Grit</strong>&#8216;s Mattie Ross</a> &#8211; who has a lump-throat-making scene where she packs her bags for adventure and stuffs rolls of newspaper in a man&#8217;s cowboy hat to make it fit her head &#8211; to <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/01/18/at-the-movies-the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo-oh-god-i-am-so-sorry-i-watched-the-remake-first/"><strong>The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo</strong>&#8216;s Lisbeth Salander</a> (arguably the ultimate Lone Woman On A Vengeful Spree for our time), and I&#8217;d like to see more scope for women in Hollywood stories to get to interact a bit more with <em>other women</em> &#8211; beyond, for example, &#8220;but mother, WHY can&#8217;t I do X&#8221; and &#8220;yes, sorceress, I will make this dodgy deal with you!&#8221; at the very least.</li>
<h3>BACK TO HURRAH-ING!</h3>
<li>Buuuut the fact remains that this scene still makes me go misty eyed and wibbly at the slightest provocation. I love how it looks and feels, and it&#8217;s got Billy Connolly (playing Princess Merida&#8217;s warlord dad, with whom she seems to have a pleasingly co-conspirator relationship rather than what I call the King Triton Model, though this does mean relations with mum aren&#8217;t looking cosy), Emma Thompson, Julie Walters (the wise woman conflict catalyst!) and more on board. It&#8217;s been co-authored by two women (for anyone casually interested in the gender balance of the creative team) and I&#8217;m honestly so excited (IT HAS A BEAR IN IT I LOVE BEARS I HOPE SHE DOES NOT SHOOT THE BEAR) that I&#8217;m really glad it won&#8217;t be long now.</li>
<li>ENTIRELY SPECULATION, BUT ANYWAY: On the fairy tale riffing front, I&#8217;m pleased to see such an obvious Robin Hood folklore moment referenced in the scene above &#8211; he, of course, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_v1OaC4jv1c#t=4m59s">splits an arrow just like this</a> in his own quest to win Maid Marion, and in this version the princess is out to win&#8230;her own hand. Neat. Since it was originally titled <em>The Bear and the Bow</em>, so presumably has a bear of some importance in the story, it&#8217;s also got me wondering whether it&#8217;ll draw on beast stories like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_of_the_Sun_and_West_of_the_Moon">East of the Sun, West of the Moon</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brown_Bear_of_Norway">Brown Bear of Norway</a>. The idea is that the woman goes on a journey and finds a man/foils a curse along the way. That might not happen in <strong>Brave</strong> at all, but since the opening problem is marriage-related I&#8217;d be surprised if no options around the topic came up, and if it doesn&#8217;t happen like that, that&#8217;ll be an attempt at subversion in itself. Either way, I think with the final title being <strong>Brave</strong> I&#8217;m optimistic about how it&#8217;ll turn out for Merida.</li>
<li>THERE IS A HORSE IN IT AND HIS NAME IS ANGUS. I love Disney&#8217;s horses. They&#8217;ve carved out a noble niche as providers of bathos and irony over the years from <a href="http://disney.wikia.com/wiki/Samson_(Sleeping_Beauty)">Samson</a> through to <a href="http://disney.wikia.com/wiki/Maximus">Maximus</a>. ANGUS, I HAVE HIGH HOPES FOR YOU. (Although I kind of wish you were an <a href="http://maxbarry.com/2011/07/08/news.html">Elspeth</a>, maybe? I mean, Maximus would&#8217;ve been fine as&#8230; Agrippina, you know?) Oh God, now everyone&#8217;s going to think I&#8217;m really weird. Uh. Moving on.</li>
<li>Conclusion: Any road, I think my DVD shelf can take one more Lone Female Crusader in this instance. See you in the cinema.</li>

					<description><![CDATA[With 'Tis Pity She's A Whore, I'm used to Annabella being painted as this passive recipient of Giovanni's affections. Not in Cheek By Jowl's new production!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I always worry about writing about theatre. I worry I&#8217;m not going to write about it like everyone else. I had this problem at Uni, where I studied the bloody thing. Everyone else would write about it in this classic, scholarly way and there&#8217;d be analysis and secondary critics and stuff, and I&#8230; well.</p>
<p>Have you ever seen those videos of Harry Potter fans in Japan? Go and YouTube some now. Okay. I&#8217;m like that, but with Jacobean revenge tragedies. I will camp out on the internet and snipe front row tickets and then work seventy hours of overtime to afford them. I will sob behind my fingers and moan, &#8220;<em>Their love is so real</em>&#8221; to myself as characters stab each other up on stage. I will embarrass the actors and everyone around me by simultaneously crying and cheering during the applause at the end. I&#8217;m getting a tattoo of one of the stage directions from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ford_(dramatist)">John Ford&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%27Tis_Pity_She%27s_a_Whore"><strong>&#8216;Tis Pity She&#8217;s A Whore</strong></a>, for crying out loud. A tattoo. This is a Thing for me. I&#8217;d reblog gifs all over Tumblr for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Changeling_(play)"><strong>The Changeling</strong></a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_II_(play)"><strong>Edward II</strong></a> if such gifs existed.</p>
<p>But they don&#8217;t, because it&#8217;s just me.</p>
<p>I get away with writing flailing fanboyish nonsense for <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/tag/markgrafs-movie-adventures/">my film reviews</a>, but I don&#8217;t know how far I&#8217;ll get away with it for this. Let&#8217;s see.</p>
<p>What it is, is that I went to see <a href="http://www.cheekbyjowl.com/tis_pity_shes_a_whore.php" target="_blank"><strong>Cheek By Jowl&#8217;s</strong> new production</a> of the aforementioned <strong>&#8216;Tis Pity She&#8217;s A Whore</strong> at the Cambridge Arts Theatre last week. It&#8217;s a modern dress production, featuring a single, static set, a nearly omnipresent ensemble cast, and modern dance. Oh, and lots and lots of sex and violence. It&#8217;s directed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declan_Donnellan"><strong>Declan Donnellan</strong></a>, who took a modern dress production around London in the &#8217;80s, and this is his new version that&#8217;s doing a big tour around France and the Sydney Festival, before coming to roost in London&#8217;s Barbican Centre in the near future.</p>
<p>Before I trundle on in my usual obtuse fashion, let me outline the plot of <strong>&#8216;Tis Pity</strong> for you, in case you don&#8217;t know it.  Once upon a time in Parma, Giovanni falls in love with his sister Annabella.  It&#8217;s requited and consensual and they carry on in secret for some time.  Annabella is, unfortunately, being courted by sixty zillion guys other than her brother, and her father&#8217;s all, &#8220;please marry someone because your brother&#8217;s a bit useless, ps. don&#8217;t marry your brother lol&#8221;.  It&#8217;s all okay and she can put off marriage virtually indefinitely, which is relevant to her interests because she&#8217;s in a very nice relationship with Giovanni, ta very much AND THEN SHE BECOMES THE PREGNANT and GUESS WHAT it&#8217;s obviously her brother&#8217;s.  So, in order to divert the dreadful shame of being pregnant out of wedlock, she marries Suitor #1, Soranzo, who is not a very nice man (with previous abusive history) and who has an even worse manservant called Vasques, who likes to shiv people.  Soranzo finds out Annabella&#8217;s pregnant, Vasques does some Sherlocking and finds out it&#8217;s Giovanni&#8217;s, and Giovanni, with time-honoured 24-carat flawless logic, decides to avert the on-coming crisis by killing Annabella, ripping out her heart, and taking the heart to a party.  Then, everyone dies.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the best play.</p>
<p>I was amazed at the audience, first. It was all &#8211; ALL &#8211; middle class couples about twice my age! They didn&#8217;t look as though they were there for the same reasons I was, to put it tactfully. I felt decidedly shifty in my spiked collar and skinny jeans, with my boyfriend and my &#8216;hawk haircut. Aside from the central relationship, I was looking forward to seeing how homoerotic this production had made Vasques&#8217;s relationship with his master, Soranzo. And, yes, I wanted to see squirting blood and eye-gouging. That&#8217;s what I was there for, and I clutched my Feelings Scarf (the stripy scarf I take to every film or play I see so that I can cuddle it and cry into it; I am ridiculous) and was essentially self conscious right up until Annabella (<strong>Lydia Wilson</strong>) came on stage.</p>
<p>As soon as she emerged, I lost my comparing-myself-to-the-audience anxiety completely. With <strong>&#8216;Tis Pity</strong>, I&#8217;m used to Annabella being painted as this passive recipient of Giovanni&#8217;s (<strong>Jack Gordon</strong>) affections. She is tossed about between her suitors and her brother, and it&#8217;s never really clear what she wants because you only ever see her through the lens of the men and their desires &#8211; so she&#8217;s this unattainable, Madonna/whore figure that I&#8217;d never really felt I could connect with.</p>
<p>Not this Annabella! Nope. She&#8217;s a tiny, scrappy waif with a half-shaved head and tangled hair, adjusting her laptop with her feet so that she can watch a film with her headphones on. Her bedroom &#8211; the set where the whole thing takes place &#8211; is adorned with posters for <strong>True Blood</strong> and <strong>Dial M For Murder</strong>, absinthe and <strong>The Vampire Diaries</strong>. She has tattoos and scruffy sneakers. Just visually, I found her easy to bond with: like someone I could have met in the pub. &#8220;Shame, though,&#8221; I thought, watching her bounce about on her bed, waiting for the lights to drop and the play to properly start, &#8220;that the play is mostly from Giovanni&#8217;s perspective.&#8221;</p>
<p>While that&#8217;s textually true, it certainly wasn&#8217;t the case for this production, which literally revolves around Annabella. She&#8217;s practically on stage all the time, even when she&#8217;s not participating in a scene. She&#8217;s picked up and hoisted about. She leads the dance numbers. She gets dressed up as a Madonna, complete with lit-up fairylight halo. She has all these extra actions and reactions, and when she speaks, she speaks&#8230; clearly. She fights back when Soranzo (<strong>Jack Hawkins</strong>) hits her. Her decisions about herself and her love life are clearly made, physically and verbally, and she makes her mind explicit. I was, frankly, amazed, having never really seen Annabella performed with this kind of clarity and sympathy before. I&#8217;m normally a Giovanni kind of guy &#8211; I always read him as this obsessive, devoted, atheist whose life is ruined by his social context and coercively-assigned religion, but Donnellan&#8217;s staging gives Annabella such agency that watching it, I found my allegience changed.</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/0lwk7EZTIHk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Soranzo, Annabella&#8217;s abusive suitor, whom she marries in haste to cover her pregnancy, was also painted rather more sympathetically than usual, which I found problematic. Yes, I know it&#8217;s boring and tedious to have Soranzo just be this using, bastardous wanker with no other dimensions at all, but, for the love of god, he hits her! He hits her and draws blood! He beats her and fetches a coathanger as if to forcibly abort her pregnancy! Come on! And then, we get this bizarre little insertion of tenderness where he buys her baby clothes and they look at them together and he&#8217;s sweet and tender, and you can see she&#8217;s changing her mind about him, and that&#8217;s not in the text, that&#8217;s been deliberately added &#8211; but why? Tell me I&#8217;m not the only one to find that intensely fucking awkward. I mentioned the coathanger, right?</p>
<p>As you can imagine, this production isn&#8217;t going to be easy viewing for everyone. It never is. It&#8217;s <strong>&#8216;Tis Pity She&#8217;s A Whore</strong>. It&#8217;s a sympathetic play about incest that features heavy violence. This, however, is a marvellously hard-hitting, sensuous, lush performance all lit in red and green, which makes the action simultaneously really gory and really&#8230; I don&#8217;t know, tactile? (Men get their shirts off a lot and touch each other. I was a bit overwhelmed. You gotta understand.)</p>
<p>Oh, wait, wait, one other thing: Vasques (<strong>Laurence Spellman</strong>). In the text, Vasques is pretty much uniformly a Super Bastard. He double-crosses everyone, faithful only to his master &#8211; also a bastard &#8211; and doesn&#8217;t hesitate to seduce and murder his way around the cast, eventually to gloat over how he, as a Spaniard, has outdone the Italians in revenge. And in this production, he&#8217;s amazingly likeable! I mean, he&#8217;s still a double-crossing, seducing bastard, but he has vulnerability and passion. He folds Soranzo up in his arms and cuddles him. (Oh, and he also has a male stripper bite out the comic relief character&#8217;s tongue on stage. He caresses and kisses said stripper while he does it.)</p>
<p>Ford should have called this play <em>Sex and Violence and Incest Party in Parma, Wooooo</em>, and I think Donnellan&#8217;s production certainly does the text justice. There&#8217;s a lot of bodily fluids either visible or implied (at one point Vasques visibly orgasms whilst licking someone&#8217;s shoes, for example) and the whole thing is amazingly visceral to an extent where audience members were cringing and gasping around me. Religion seeps through the action to a huge extent, as is only proper &#8211; there&#8217;s veils and rosaries aplenty, and a bleeding-heart Jesus on the wall. You end up feeling that, were it not for a societal damnation of incest and premarital sex, Giovanni and boisterous, playful Annabella would be happy together; their separation through the external (ecclesiastical) pressures on her to marry is heartbreakingly, agonisingly painful.</p>
<p>Oh, and there&#8217;s a dancing cardinal.</p>
<p>If you have the means and time to go and see this production, I cannot recommend it highly enough. You won&#8217;t see anything else like it, and <strong>&#8216;Tis Pity</strong> is performed so rarely (probably due to the content!) that when a company does do it, it&#8217;s because they really relish it, and it shows. It really shows.</p>
<p>SUFFICE TO SAY, my Feelings Scarf got a good wringing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Beware, gentle reader!  For this fair review contains those demons known as SPOILERS!!  While they are not major plot spoilers, there is mention of Stuff That Matters, so if this causes your brow to sweat, TREAD CAREFULLY!  And you might want to skip the entire review and just look at the picture at the bottom.</strong></p>
<p>Father Christmas begins his judgement of whether or not potential gift recipients have been Naughty or Nice well back in February.  January is his holiday month, where no paperwork is done.  It all starts in February, that judgement process.  He&#8217;s got a lot of people to get through, and the judgement of Naughty or Nice is perilous.  Some people write him letters.  That makes it easier; except those bastards who write something extolling how such a polarised morality system is flawed, and the whole concept of &#8220;Naughtiness&#8221; is subjective.  These people usually get a lump of coal, a black top hat and the GPS location of my bedroom.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, the more Father Christmas can mass-judge and dispense identical recompense or reward &#8211; known as &#8220;blanketing&#8221; &#8211; the easier his job is.  So any opportunity he has to reward an entire section of humanity in one go, he takes it.  Of course he does.  Wouldn&#8217;t you?</p>
<p>Anyway, that&#8217;s why <strong>Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows</strong> exists.  Father Christmas noticed that an awful lot of people who had exhibited exemplary behaviour this year were linked by their communal desire to see <strong>Robert Downey Jnr.</strong> touch <strong>Jude Law</strong> with as much of his naked body as possible, and pulled a few strings at Warner Brothers &#8211; he has fingers in many pies, you see &#8211; and here we are.</p>
<p>I got all this, incidentally, from a few of my double-agent elves stationed in his workhouse.  I intend on repurposing his operation for my own, er, purposes.<sup><a href="/2011/12/23/at-the-movies-sherlock-holmes-a-game-of-making-them-as-married-as-possible/#footnote_0_9163" id="identifier_0_9163" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="If you read to the end of this sentence, you will forget everything I have said in this article.

Image via Wikipedia, shared under Fair Use guidelines." width="292" height="432" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Sherlock_Holmes2Poster.jpg?w=292&amp;ssl=1 292w, https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Sherlock_Holmes2Poster.jpg?w=202&amp;ssl=1 202w" sizes="(max-width: 292px) 100vw, 292px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>So: <strong>Sherlock Holmes 2</strong> (let&#8217;s call it that for short) follows in the grand tradition of making Holmes and Watson as blatantly married as possible without allowing them to actually kiss.  From my perspective as an audience member, it looks almost like a <em>game</em> directors (in this case, <strong>Guy Ritchie</strong>) play: given that both Holmes <em>and</em> Watson have female love interests, how can they convey just how deeply involved with each other they are without resorting to boring, obvious techniques such as having them snog or surreptitiously shag in a train?  Ritchie leaps the first hurdle &#8211; that of the lady interlopers &#8211; with little difficulty.  He kills off Irene Adler (<strong>Rachel McAdams</strong>) in a single scene with no ambiguity or remorse.  Thought she was fun and interesting and looked forward to seeing more of her in this film?  Tough!  Down she goes in a fit of unceremonious bloody coughing under the impassive gaze of Dr Moriarty (the terrifying <strong>Jared Harris</strong>) from behind a teacup.</p>
<p>Watson&#8217;s wife, Mary (<strong>Kelly Reilly</strong>), though clearly a bit of an unflappable, gun-cocking badass herself, gets about ten lines in total, and is dressed up and polished as a dreadful gooseberry to Watson and Holmes&#8217;s gay domestic bliss.  It&#8217;s a shame, and, you know, I&#8217;d hiss and spit about it more and about how it seems that people are resentful of any differently-gendered third party to a homoerotic pairing (canon or not) as if any hint of heterosexuality immediately ruins everything like bisexuality or polyamory don&#8217;t fucking exist BUT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND, THERE WAS HALF-NAKED SPOONING AND LOTS OF HURT/COMFORT.  I CAN’T STAY ANGRY AT IT.</p>
<p>I just penned a paragraph listing all of the things Holmes and Watson do or say to each other that could have been replaced wholesale with extended, visceral scenes of them fellating each other&#8217;s tongues, but then I ran out of recommended wordcount for the article and I don&#8217;t want to anger my editor.  Suffice to say, it&#8217;s a lot, verging on ALL THINGS.  You&#8217;re probably not very surprised.  I did say the film was a reward for the RDJ/JL cabal and the Holmes/Watson contingent.  That&#8217;s a lot of people who&#8217;ve been basically Mahatma Ghandi this year.  Well done those people.</p>
<p>But it does bring me back to the point I always get up in my grill when I watch &#8220;bromances&#8221; such as this, and that is<em>: it&#8217;s not enough</em>.  Don’t you dare call this a queer film because it isn’t.  It <em>mollifies</em>, rather than actually addresses any visibility issues.  It flirts, but is ultimately a bit of a cocktease.  I know there&#8217;s the argument that emotionally intense (but not actually sexual) relationships between women get a lot of screen time in fictional media, and intimate inter-female friendships have a bigger presence in the collective conscience of Western culture (that group toilet trip thing, for instance) so it&#8217;s not fair that men can only slap each other tentatively on the back or &#8211; gasp! &#8211; they&#8217;ll be branded as &#8220;gay&#8221;, but what <em>I&#8217;m</em> most concerned with is the abandonment of all this bollocks heterocentrism.  Let&#8217;s just stop erecting the acceptable-emotional-involvement barricade just shy of physical intimacy just in case we end up <em>ruining</em> Western civilisation with these <em>thoughtless</em> same-gender relationships.  Go the whole bloody hog, would you?  Or are you only flirting with the idea of homoeroticism because you think it&#8217;s ridiculous?  Neither is good.</p>
<p>And I <em>know</em> a million people before me have complained about the lack of queer visibility in mainstream media, and how mixed-gender couples get an awful lot of privilege in terms of representation, but seeing something like <strong>Sherlock 2</strong> &#8211; whereby the two heroes come <em>so close</em> to just coupling it up all over the screen but are clearly prevented by the fear that the merest hint of consummation will send the Straight Cis Male audience members fleeing like Bill Bailey from the <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/09/26/at-the-movies-troll-hunter-or-whos-coming-to-norway-with-us/" target="_blank">Trollhunter</a> &#8211; just makes me see red.  The Rage Cage descends.  (I have actually written this part of the review through the Rage Cage after all!)</p>

I&#8217;m sorry.  Let me fix that.  The violence is up in this film: it&#8217;s very gritty and very hard-hitting compared with its predecessor, and there&#8217;s a lot of Ritchie&#8217;s favourite slo-mo impacts and explosions.  A lot of the violence focuses on the militaristic, rather than the directly interpersonal as in the first film.  There&#8217;s a scene wherein our heroes and the amazing <strong>Noomi Rapace</strong> (who was Lisbeth Salander in the original <strong>Girl With The Dragon Tattoo</strong> films) as a tousle-haired &#8220;Gypsy&#8221; knife-fighting fortune teller (oh my god I&#8217;d bloody <em>love</em> to see a Traveller character of any ethnic background who <em>wasn&#8217;t</em> at least one of those things) charge through a forest whilst being shelled by heavy artillery.  They all survive, miraculously, but the actual filming of the ballistics in graphic, almost comic-book-style, all slow motion and muted sound, makes it so brutal that I found it quite difficult to watch.  And I&#8217;m all over my violence, usually &#8211; as we know.  It was probably the intended effect, anyway; so a winner is you, Mr Ritchie!  You harrowed me out with artillery explosions, and this isn’t even a “war film”.  Well done.</p>
<p>As this film also caters to those steampunk kids, there&#8217;s lots of machine porn: lots of mechanical extreme close-ups and sweeping racks of armaments.  Everyone gets armed with new, shiny, extremely destructive firearms.  Bullet-holes are examined, and Watson&#8217;s military past is brought up often.  War pervades.  Terrorism happens: &#8220;extreme political movements&#8221; and &#8220;anarchists&#8221; are framed for the detonation of bombs, carefully engineered to pit the European powerhouses against each other in bloody conflict.</p>
<p>With this backdrop of indiscriminate, impersonal violence, Watson and Holmes&#8217;s adoring, frequently tactile relationship sticks out like a sore, er, thumb.  It&#8217;s amazing.  Their emotional interplay &#8211; the most profound moment for me was when Watson fished Holmes out of a collapsed tower and stroked his hair &#8211; is like a warm, soft thing in amongst rubble and bullets.  Ahhh.  It&#8217;s ever so nice.  <em>Still not enough, though.</em></p>
<p>But I wish they&#8217;d had Rapace&#8217;s lovely lady in it more.  She was resourceful and believably earnest; her performance refreshingly down-to-earth and human next to RDJ and Law&#8217;s saucy ping-pong.  There&#8217;s several gorgeous scenes where Mycroft (played by the oozingly lovely <strong>Dame Stephen of Fry</strong>), Sherlock and Watson have a sort of banter-off, and Simza sits watchably increasingly perplexed, alternately following their conversation and letting it pass her by.  She was very real.  She even bled and reacted to pain in real, non-dramatic, human ways, which is unusual in films of this genre &#8211; and makes a particular contrast with the theatrical, fancy-hatted Irene.  But she didn&#8217;t have nearly enough presence, losing out drastically to Sherlohn Watsolmes in terms of screen time &#8211; which, you know, fair enough: the film is about <em>them</em>, but she really was wonderful.  I think she and Fry&#8217;s Mycroft should have their own spin-off where they ooze and stab their way around Europe in search of the perfect hat.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[It's ostensibly based on the book by Dumas, but much in the same way that every time I take a trip to Tesco, the journey is based on Virgil's Aeneid.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am the worst person in the world to take to a cinema. Cinemas turn me, through no fault of my own, into a Grade A Douchebag. I just find the whole experience too engrossing. My ticket crumples in my eager hand as I enter the theatre, and <em>magic</em> happens. The low light, the seats and the excited quiet cause a strange mutation in my brain and suddenly, <em>the whole world </em>is just me and that cinema, <em>and nothing else matters</em>.</p>
<p>I laugh. I cry. I shriek like an excited child. I hurl insults, groan and grip the hand of the person sitting next to me, and I just can&#8217;t help it. The film, in that darkened, magical room full of equally hypnotised people and their rustling sweets, is my <em>entire life</em> for the hours that it runs.</p>
<p>Now, if a film is uniformly delightful, I&#8217;ll get used to the level of delight it&#8217;s producing in me and be relatively quiet. If it&#8217;s uniformly miserable, I&#8217;ll just cry quietly to myself for the duration. If it&#8217;s completely terrible, I&#8217;ll start out shouting and then my fury will dull into silence, while I glare at the screen with the cold, dead eyes of a shark. But if a film varies, and has parts that I love and parts that I hate, I&#8217;ll react anew to the different levels of content as they emerge.</p>
<p>Paul WS Anderson&#8217;s <strong>The Three Musketeers</strong> was, therefore, a big problem for everyone else in the cinema.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>**** WARNING: spoilers from here on out!****</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a film with its pros and cons, as most films are, but the problem with this film for me was that the pros and cons were both very forthright in how pro-y or con-y they were, and they constantly vied for supremacy. The result was a sort of see-saw effect, whereby the quality of the film yo-yoed wildly from start to finish, and my face was sort of like this:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm7.static.flickr.com/6108/6257094428_b9c6d39fa6_o.jpg?resize=500%2C245" alt="A drawing on textured card. On the left, a see-saw out of balance. One end has " width="500" height="245" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/farm7.static.flickr.com/6058/6257094560_eb5908aa0e.jpg?resize=500%2C268" alt="A drawing on textured card. On the left, a see-saw out of balance. One end has " width="500" height="268" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>So at the end, I looked a bit like this:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" class=" aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/farm7.static.flickr.com/6103/6257094654_0396f80ca1.jpg?resize=200%2C321" alt="A drawing on textured card. It depicts the artist, a young man with short, spiky hair, awash with fury and dismay, but also, paradoxically, elation and delight. He is drooling slightly." width="200" height="321" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Oh my god you guys, <em>what was this film.</em> It was obvious that they knew what they wanted to <em>do</em> with it, but really weren&#8217;t sure <em>how. </em> As you can tell from the title, it&#8217;s ostensibly based on Alexandre Dumas&#8217; lovely book, but much in the same way that every time I take a trip to Tesco, the journey is based on Virgil&#8217;s Aeneid. I read <strong>The Three Musketeers</strong> when I was young &#8211; so young, in fact, that the memory is a mere rose-coloured blip on the horizon of my literary consumption &#8211; so have possibly unrealistic recollections of how ludicrous it was. But I&#8217;m pretty sure the bloody thing didn&#8217;t have <em>zeppelins designed by Leonardo da Vinci.</em></p>
<p>The whole thing&#8217;s meant to be set in the year 17-whatsit, and the costume department and set designers have had a fucking ball with it. The clothes are divine, and the interiors are spot-on. It&#8217;s really lush to look at, the attention to detail &#8211; even in the weaponry &#8211; is sublime, which makes it all the more bloody baffling that they saw fit to sledgehammer shit like <em>rotary platform mini-cannons</em> and <em>clockpunk crossbows </em>on top. The final straw for me was the sudden, rage-cage-inducing appearance of <em>modern stringed instruments</em> at the end.</p>
<p>The way I see it is this: if you love 18th century France so much, don&#8217;t spend oodles of obvious love and affection recreating that amazing period of European history in all its gaudy, beautiful, corrupt and hilarious glory and then promptly drizzle congealed green-screened steampunk on top! And if you want it to be a full-on, anachronistic love-in with airship-mounted flamethrowers, stop pretending it&#8217;s in any way historically accurate! Go the whole hog! Have a mechanical Tyrannosaur! Stick Cardinal Richelieu in leather!</p>
<p>&#8230;Ooh.</p>
<p>And the dialogue. Oh, god. The <em>dialogue</em>. It was clearly written by a team who thought they were far more witty than they really were (<strong>Alex Litvak</strong> and <strong>Andrew Davis</strong>, <em>I&#8217;m looking at you</em>) and while the cast, bless them, did their best, no one &#8211; not even <strong>Christoph Waltz</strong>, doing a staggeringly attractive turn as Richelieu &#8211; could redeem the continual stream of steaming cat vomit.</p>
<p>This brings me on, neatly, to the casting, one of the film&#8217;s only saving graces. As I say, Waltz is charismatic and delicious as usual, but it isn&#8217;t just him carrying the show. The Musketeers themselves (<strong>Matthew Macfadyen, Luke Evans </strong>and<strong> Ray Stevenson</strong>) are fun to watch<sup><a href="/2011/10/24/at-the-movies-the-three-musketeers-or-markgraf-loses-it/#footnote_0_7912" id="identifier_0_7912" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Aramis is a priest. I will fight anyone going for Aramis. And I will win.">1</a></sup> with good interpersonal chemistry (OT3 FOREVER) and King Louis XIII, (played by <strong>Freddie Fox</strong>, characterised as basically me in a sparkly hat) is a gigantic hilarious fop. To balance out the prevalence of heroes, I was personally foaming with delight to see that we had not one, but <em>three and a half</em> whole villains to choose from! <strong>Milla Jovovitch</strong>, who is my future wife by the way, does a truly spectacular turn as demi-villain <strong>Milady de Winter</strong> (but more on that in a bit), an eyepatched <strong>Mads Mikkelsen</strong> (who you may remember as the blood-weeping, testicle-flogging villain in 2006&#8217;s <strong>Casino Royale</strong>) as the Cardinal&#8217;s captain of the guard, swanning about in red brocade being all leg and blades, and <strong>Orlando Bloom</strong>.</p>
<p>&#8230; Orlando Bloom. Now. I <em>hate</em> Orlando Bloom. I&#8217;ve found him <em>phenomenally</em> unremarkable in everything he&#8217;s been in to date, and in every case his universal expression is the perplexed discomfort of a dog that&#8217;s been instructed to sit on snowy ground. Here, he&#8217;s the villainous <strong>Buckingham</strong> &#8211; a tarted-up-to-the-nines fop with a pearl earring and a 24-carat smirk, and he&#8217;s fucking perfect.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m terrified that &#8211; after his Oscar-guzzling performance as <strong>Hans Landa</strong> in Quarantino&#8217;s most recent romp, <strong>Inglourious Basterds</strong> &#8211; Christoph Waltz will be forever cast by English-language cinema as villains, and <strong>Musketeers</strong> certainly doesn&#8217;t abate my fear. But please, <em>please</em>, gods of cinema, if there is any justice in the world, <em>please</em> let Orlando Bloom be typecast for life as a scenery-chewing villain off the back of this film alone. He&#8217;s having so much fun! He&#8217;s more camp than a goth Mardi Gras! The facial hair suits him and everything! I never want to see him doing the beleaguered hero act<em> ever again</em>.</p>
<p>So the casting&#8217;s great. Except, sadly, <strong>D&#8217;Artagnan</strong> (<strong>Logan Lerman</strong>), who&#8217;s irritating, boring, and frankly too young to carry the role off with any gravitas. But all of his shortcomings pale in comparison to the humanoid plankton<sup><a href="/2011/10/24/at-the-movies-the-three-musketeers-or-markgraf-loses-it/#footnote_1_7912" id="identifier_1_7912" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="No offence to plankton.">2</a></sup> cast as his love-interest, <strong>Constance </strong>(<strong>Gabrielle Wilde</strong>). She has one facial expression:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm7.static.flickr.com/6035/6257094298_d61e47011b.jpg?resize=390%2C438" alt="A drawing of a pretty, if vacant, girl. She stares straight ahead with blank eyes and parted lips.  There is nothing interesting about her face whatsoever.  She is wearing an elaborate gown, of which only the neckline and collar is visible." width="390" height="438" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>This is her expression for all things. Delivering sarcastic put-downs, being dangled from the prow of an airship, stumbling along a boardwalk a million miles from the ground and being held at knifepoint. All that face, and a monotone to match. It&#8217;s awful. It&#8217;s not even as if she gets nothing to do. She gets herself captured on D&#8217;Artagnan&#8217;s behalf by dressing as him and acting as bait<sup><a href="/2011/10/24/at-the-movies-the-three-musketeers-or-markgraf-loses-it/#footnote_2_7912" id="identifier_2_7912" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="with the laziest drag I have ever seen &ndash; SHE WEARS HIS HAT! That&rsquo;s not drag, that&rsquo;s what I do in the hat section of John Lewis for fun.">3</a></sup> and that could be amazing! But she does it with the charisma and presence of a bowl of cold soup.</p>

There are actually quite a lot of women in the film, serving &#8211; on paper &#8211; very important roles. The Queen (<strong>Juno Temple</strong>) has an entire contingent of ladies-in-waiting, of which Constance is one, and the Bechdel pass comes when she asks for her jewels, only to find that they&#8217;ve been stolen. It&#8217;s only one line, though! She spends the entire film surrounded by women, having a fun time in the garden and calling Richelieu on his bullshit to his face, but <em>she</em> never gets more than a meagre handful of lines. Why? It feels as if the lines she does get &#8211; there are literally only about four &#8211; and the placement of them are lip service to having to write her a part. So, in an entire French fucking court of women that practically fills the screen, they only get six lines between them. WHY? Is there a LAW against women advancing the plot? The Queen has a vital fucking ROLE in the plot, as she&#8217;s one of the chief pawns that Richelieu fucks about with!</p>
<p>But yet, she&#8217;s completely out-parted by&#8230; Milla.</p>
<p>Oh, Milla. I love you so much. You&#8217;re the lizard-eyed, carved-bicepped, bullet-dodging action queen of my dreams. This role is a fucking gift for her. Milady is a double-agent, assassin <em>and</em> spy! She&#8217;s a fucking Swiss army knife of bad-assery. She&#8217;s got a lockpick haircomb, icy-cool emotional control to spare, and abseiling stays. She can dual-wield a pistol and a rapier, has no problems selling people out or killing them, and appears to be literally invincible. <a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/milady.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="8003" data-permalink="/2011/10/24/at-the-movies-the-three-musketeers-or-markgraf-loses-it/milady/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/milady.jpg?fit=470%2C661&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="470,661" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="milady" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/milady.jpg?fit=213%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/milady.jpg?fit=470%2C661&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8003" title="milady" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/milady-213x300.jpg?resize=213%2C300" alt="poster promoting Milady with 'Milla Jovovich is...

It&#8217;s all going so well! And then her clothes fall off and she becomes a lingerie model on a clock, complete with lascivious camera pan. Because, obviously, men won&#8217;t understand or enjoy a woman being badass unless she&#8217;s got as few clothes on as possible (even in a culture where the collars were big and the dresses bigger). I cried. <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/01/19/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-the-frank-miller-effect-strikes-again/" target="_blank">Sex assassin, ho! </a></p>
<p>Speaking of assassins, the opening action scene is in Venice. &#8220;VENICE, ITALY!!&#8221; we&#8217;re told (to differentiate, presumably, from Venice, Barnsley). A guard stands watch on a dark canal edge. Something bubbles in the water at his feet. Suddenly, a dart is fired straight from the water into his gullet. Athos emerges, wet and masked, armed with some kind of automatic crossbow.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Aramis, hooded and billowy, synchs up a viewpoint before Leap-of-Faithing down onto a gondola.</p>
<p>Porthos manages to get a kill-streak of 15, fighting off soldiers in a basement, earning himself a new trophy!</p>
<p>They have basically made <strong>Assassin&#8217;s Creed II</strong>: THE MOVIE, and split Ezio into three people.</p>
<p>The rage-cage descended over my eyes. HOW DARE THEY, I announced, being restrained by the two people who foolishly accompanied me to the cinema. GET OFF MY ASSCREED, I declared. People had started to stare. PRESS X TO AVOID MY ACID VOMIT OF WRATH, I continued. I was out of control. It was of great relief to everyone when the scene changed and I could be pacified with Mads Mikkelsen&#8217;s gorgeous cheekbones and mile-long legs.</p>
<p>All in all, a mixed bag. Like reaching your hand into pick &#8216;n&#8217; mix and being unsure as to whether you&#8217;ll get a fizzy cola bottle or an enraged musk rat.</p>
<h3>YOU SHOULD SEE THIS FILM BECAUSE:</h3>
<ul>
<li>It is so blisteringly camp and sparkly that I came out wearing glitter that I didn&#8217;t go in with</li>
<li>The sets and costumes are lush beyond compare</li>
<li>The casting&#8217;s brilliant, with few exceptions</li>
<li>It&#8217;s one for the Eurofilm nerds, with excellent performances from Mikkelsen, Waltz and a motley crew of Brits &#8211; and an unexpected, hilarious cameo from Til Schweiger, who starred alongside Waltz in <strong>Inglourious Basterds</strong></li>
<li>VILLAIN PORN!!! VILLAIN!!! PORN!!! YES!!!</li>
</ul>
<h3>YOU SHOULD NOT SEE THIS FILM BECAUSE:</h3>
<ul>
<li>It just doesn&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s doing, with anything, ever, <em>especially the women</em></li>
<li>&#8220;What? You mean&#8230; just having them on-screen <em>isn&#8217;t good enough</em>? :(&#8220;</li>
<li>The dialogue&#8217;s an experience quite a lot like snorting crushed glass</li>
<li>I&#8217;d rather deep-throat a live conga eel than watch the scenes with D&#8217;Artagnan in again</li>
<li>Who the hell thought model battle-maps would make good scene transition material?</li>
<li>Why is D&#8217;Artagnan glaringly American, when everyone else at least tries to be pseudo-British?</li>
<li>MODERN FUCKING INSTRUMENTS HRRGHNH WHY GOD</li>

We may just have to yell the lyrics to Bad Reputation in unison. Won&rsquo;t that be great! We&rsquo;re all classically trained at Grade 8 in caterwauling, I promise you. ">1</a></sup> </p>
<p>AND NOW, THE LINKS.</p>
<ul>
<li>NURSE, THE SCREENS! Comics artist <strong>Cliff Chiang</strong> appears to be deliberately trying to incite a Fansplosion of Joy at BadRep Towers. Check out this artwork, in which a bunch of DC superheroines have a &#8220;Tonight, Matthew&#8230;&#8221; moment, and rock out as <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/10/08/i-wanna-be-where-the-boys-are-the-runaways-and-rock-n-roll-double-standards/">The Runaways</a>. Ah, hell, let&#8217;s stick it up here:<br />
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/chiangrunaways.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="5960" data-permalink="/2011/06/10/before-we-slutwalk-let-us-linkwalk/chiangrunaways/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/chiangrunaways.jpg?fit=595%2C865&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="595,865" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="chiangrunaways" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/chiangrunaways.jpg?fit=206%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/chiangrunaways.jpg?fit=595%2C865&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/chiangrunaways-206x300.jpg?resize=206%2C300" alt="Art by Cliff Chiang depicting Wonder Woman, Black Canary, Oracle and Zatanna as the band The Runaways." title="chiangrunaways" width="206" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5960" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/chiangrunaways.jpg?w=206&amp;ssl=1 206w, https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/chiangrunaways.jpg?w=595&amp;ssl=1 595w" sizes="(max-width: 206px) 100vw, 206px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
<a href="http://www.cliffchiang.com/2011/05/31/i-dont-give-a-damn-bout-my-bad-reputation/">He&#8217;s even titled it <em>I Don&#8217;t Give A Damn &#8216;Bout My Bad Reputation</em></a>. Particularly digging the way Joan Jett/Wonder Woman&#8217;s lasso doubles as a guitar cable. Shiny. The folks at <strong>Comics Alliance</strong> also felt the urge to shout about it, and their piece i<a href="http://www.comicsalliance.com/2011/06/01/cliff-chiang-runs-away-and-rocks-out-with-dcs-most-iconic-heroines/">s worth a read for its comparison to another bit of cool punk/superhero mashup art</a>. Anyway, as a result of all this excitement we&#8217;re now restraining the urge to cosplay as superheroes cosplaying as rockstars. Too much meta. Much, much too complicated for a Friday morning. BUT WE THOUGHT ABOUT IT.</li>
<li><strong>Crunk Feminist Collective</strong> talks<a href="http://crunkfeministcollective.wordpress.com/2011/05/23/slutwalks-v-ho-strolls/"> language, race, and assumptions within feminist and press coverage of the SlutWalk phenomenon</a>. Much as we&#8217;re behind the march itself, this post raises issues &#8211; unraised in any other coverage we&#8217;ve seen &#8211; well worth contemplating, whether you&#8217;re a marcher or not.</li>
<li>electronic doll of adult (and therefore NSFW) blog <strong>Post Modern Sleaze</strong> <a href="http://pmsleaze.blogspot.com/2011/06/walk-like-slut.html">talks consent, clothes, sexism and SlutWalking</a>.</li>
<li>After the folks who run the <strong>Imperial War Museum</strong>&#8216;s twitter account <a href="http://twitter.com/I_W_M/status/78472611746689026">read and linked to</a> our <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/06/07/women-war-artists-at-the-imperial-war-museum/">post</a> on their Women War Artists exhibition this week, we got chatting and ended up spending quite a bit of time browsing the extensive online archive of propaganda posters &#8211; <a href="http://www.iwmcollections.org.uk/dbtw-wpd/exec/dbtwpub.dll?QF0=IDNO&#038;QI0=PST+2832&#038;QF1=URLEncodedDeptName&#038;QI1=Art&#038;TN=Uncat&#038;RF=allDetails&#038;AC=QBE_QUERY">the history of this one is pretty interesting</a>. Thought <a href="http://www.iwm.org.uk/upload/package/30/women/babes.htm">this teaching resource, titled &#8220;War Babes&#8221;</a>, was pretty cool &#8211; it encourages the class to unpick gender stereotypes and challenge their own assumptions just a little bit. More than we were expecting, anyway.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#8217;s it! See you on SlutWalk London!</p>
