So here I am talking about traditional Anglo-American music. Problem solved.</p>
<p>I was also inspired by a question from <a title="Twitter - Feminister" href="http://twitter.com/FeministInti">@FeministInti</a> to her twitter followers: do you know any folk songs that feature gender-based violence? The answer is yes, AND HOW. In a few moments we had amassed enough for a limited edition CD box set of traditional songs about rape, domestic violence and murdered women.</p>
<p>It tends to be these songs that a lot of modern folkish artists have picked up on. Yes, I’m looking at you Nick Cave. And you, Decemberists, although I love you. There are also a lot (a LOT) of waiflike folk girls with guitars singing about how love is like a cloud or they’re not sure which handbag matches their heart, as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S8UxfY9HtY">parodied</a> by Bill Bailey.</p>
<p>As an antidote to the murdery and misogynist on the one hand and the mindlessly insipid and pathetic on the other I thought I would take this opportunity to share and celebrate some traditional songs in which women come out on top.</p>
<p>Note: Because the songs are hundreds of years old in some cases there’s quite a lot of variety over names and lyrics. I managed to find versions of nearly all of them on Spotify and have made a collaborative playlist so y’all can add any others you find: <a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/sajarina/playlist/3HNBKRwCGTqGMVKHko3PG4">Kickass women in folk songs</a>.</p>

<p>Now THIS is what I’m talking about &#8211; songs about women dressing as sailors, hunters and highwaymen, whether to find their true love or just for kicks. Some of them sound a little unhinged: like Sovay, who is prepared to blow her lover’s head off if he gives up the love token she has given him. But the heroine in &#8216;The Golden Glove&#8217; is very endearing as she cleverly arranges matters so that she can marry the man she loves (and “enjoy” him, as she sings gleefully).</p>
<p>If you’d like more stories of derring-do like this, I recommend Dianne Dugaw’s <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=btgPj6eDZvMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=warrior+women+and+popular+balladry&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dg4f9Pc0pG&amp;sig=iG_Dy87l_aYVOj1ugB8hkkyUXps&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=8eKgTbuFPNGahQfCo-n1BA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"><strong>Warrior Women and Popular Balladry, 1650-1850</strong></a>.</p>
<h3>Sovay</h3>
<blockquote><p>“Sovay Sovay all on a day<br />
She dressed herself in man&#8217;s array<br />
With a brace of pistols all at her side<br />
To meet her true love, to meet her true love, for did she ride”</p></blockquote>

<h2>Cowgirls</h2>
<p>Just a couple of examples &#8211; &#8216;I Wanna Be A Cowboy&#8217;s Sweetheart&#8217; is basically about a woman who wants to be a cowboy, the ‘sweetheart’ of the title is purely incidental, and &#8216;Belle Starr&#8217; is about a real life <a title="Wikipedia - Belle Starr" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belle_Starr">wild west fugitive</a> who had a number of famous fugitive lovers.</p>

<h2>Bold and crafty women</h2>
<p>The Crafty Maid and Lovely Joan outsmart their arrogant would-be seducers and make off with their horses. Sally Brown kicks the ass of the Cruel Youth, saving her own life and avenging the deaths of the ‘pretty maidens’ who went before her, and the Bonny Lass of Angelsey dances the king and 15 of his knights out of their swag.</p>

<h3>Silver Dagger</h3>
<p>The woman in Joan Baez’s version of the Silver Dagger decides not to risk getting her heart broken by keeping clear of love altogether. Whether she’s right or wrong, I like that she makes a choice.</p>
<blockquote><p>“My daddy is a handsome devil<br />
He&#8217;s got a chain five miles long<br />
And on every link a heart does dangle<br />
Of another maid he&#8217;s loved and wronged.”</p></blockquote>
