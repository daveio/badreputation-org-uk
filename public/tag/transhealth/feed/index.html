					<description><![CDATA[We're selling postcards of Markgraf's movie cartoons. How and why? Find out here.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Check it out, another post from me.  I ran a few short, sexy opening paragraphs through my head for this, like &#8220;You&#8217;ve all heard of SPRING CLEANING, well!  It&#8217;s spring!  And thus I am CLEANING MY ENTIRE FACE&#8221;, or &#8220;INTERNET.  I am your pen-wielding LORD AND MASTER.  It is TIME FOR MY SUPPLICATION.&#8221;</p>
<p>But all of them sounded &#8230;well, like that.  So imagine I&#8217;ve written a far sexier, funnier, less isolatingly-esoteric opening paragraph, and we&#8217;ll run with it.</p>

<p>As you all know by now, I&#8217;m a transgender man.  As you may <em>not </em>know, I&#8217;m doing a medical transition on the good old NHS.  Another thing you won&#8217;t know is that for (disgusting, enraging) reasons I won&#8217;t go into here, my beloved NHS are yanking me about something heartbreakingly chronic as regards my embarkation on hormone therapy.</p>
<p>With this development in mind, I&#8217;m going to see Dr. Curtis of <a href="http://transhealth.co.uk/" target="_blank">Transhealth</a> instead, with the hope that he can cajole my own GP into prescribing me MAGICAL MAN JUICES.</p>
<p>But this requires money.  Of course it does.  So!  To that end, <strong>I&#8217;m going to start selling some art (a selection of which will be right here on BadRep) for your personal delectation. </strong> And that&#8217;s not all!  Ohhh, no.  Let it be known I&#8217;m not a guy who does things by halves.  Halves are <em>for the weak</em>, and I, dear reader, have the strength of SIXTEEN WEREWOLVES MADE OUT OF NUCLEAR SUBMARINES.  Figuratively speaking.  I was rubbish at P.E. at school.  This is purely figurative strength.</p>
<p>Er, yes.  The other non-BadRep related things I&#8217;m selling are limited edition art prints (running to an <em>stupidly</em> restricted run of <em>one copy each</em> due to costs) of my own work one of my own websites.<sup><a href="/2011/04/12/coming-soon-to-the-br-towers-shop-page/#footnote_0_4785" id="identifier_0_4785" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" You heard that right.  My real website.  Where I really live.  With my real actual name.  This totally feels like relinquishing my superhero identity.  BUT HOW WILL I NOW FIGHT CRIME ">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The relevant link, if you&#8217;d like to spend an extortionate amount of money on a single-edition print of some filthy gorgeous pin-up art, <a href="http://goldfeathers.insanejournal.com/12942.html" target="_blank">is right the hell here</a>.  They are vastly more expensive than the things I&#8217;ll be selling here on BadRep &#8211; but they&#8217;re one each, and <em>that&#8217;s all there will ever be.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Right here on the good ship BadRep, however, <strong>I&#8217;m going to be selling wee postcard prints of <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/tag/markgrafs-movie-adventures/">your favourite film review cartoons </a><em>and</em> amusing stickers with which you can dazzle and confuse your friends and enemies! </strong> And if you&#8217;re especially good, I&#8217;ll sell off the<strong> original pen drawings</strong> of the comics, too, for I am a generous god, and have far too much original artwork in my house.  Also, it&#8217;s on the back of the bulk condom packaging I steal from work.  It&#8217;s like upcycling!  Only with more &#8230;sneaky sexual health awareness?  I have no idea.</p>
<p>Watch this space for inadvisable BadRep merch like a hawk with nineteen eyes <em>that never sleeps</em>.  And then you can rest assured that your money has helped fund some totally inadvisable facial hair.</p>
<p>(Psst: The link I mentioned earlier takes you to my sketchblog.  If you want to look at my hip, swanky portfolio, <a href="http://from-eyes.black-ink.org" target="_blank">that&#8217;s right here</a>.)</p>
