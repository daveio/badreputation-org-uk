<p>I&#8217;m very used to seeing Action Movie Posters &#8211; they tend to have muscle men front and centre. If women appear then they have strangely low cut tops and are in that curious pose that only women in posters ever adopt.</p>
<p>You know, the one in which they twist around in order to show their bottoms, chest  and face<em> at the same time</em>. Seriously &#8211; click <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PIoeZmPAAF4/TPazla4vYLI/AAAAAAAAAFM/yY9qnY2NmM0/s1600/Tron-Legacy-movie-poster-Jem-Beau-Garret-1-422x600.jpg">here</a>, <a href="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31ew%2B%2BJMggL.jpg">here</a>, <a href="http://www.ramasscreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/gijoe-scarlett-poster1.jpg">here</a> and <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_lweymjmz4GY/TEmjxTDROEI/AAAAAAAAQW8/nhtOieBdY0A/s1600/sucker_punch_poster04.jpg">here</a> for some quick examples. Then walk around all day trying to work out when you <em>ever</em> do that pose naturally.</p>
<p><a href="http://collider.com/uploads/imageGallery/Shoot_em_Up/shoot_em_up_movie_poster_onesheet_clive_owen.jpg">Here&#8217;s a man in the same pose</a>. Note massive coat covering everything.</p>
<p>So you can really play Spot The Difference here. On this poster, not only are there more women than men, but they are all dressed pretty much the same. And no-one is wearing ridiculous costumes. Or standing in a funny way.</p>
<p>Yes, the women are all pretty actor types. But then so are the men.</p>
<p>The film itself (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomorrow,_When_the_War_Began_(film)">wiki article here</a>) is coming out shortly. I had to check what it was about to make sure I wasn&#8217;t making some terrible mistake &#8211; if so, I&#8217;ll have been tricked into promoting a hideous anti-feminist car crash of a film.</p>
<p>Now, the plot is not without its problems, though mostly around the issue of race rather than gender: teenagers fight a guerilla war after their Australian town is invaded by the Asian &#8220;Coalition Nations&#8221;. This is such a hackneyed big budget trope (attack by foreigners/aliens), and it clashes a bit with the indie flick, Blair Witch-esque documentary feel I got <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk0sM6s7iOY">from the trailer</a>.</p>
<p>I remain hopeful (fingers crossed) that, like the poster, the film will do something different.</p>
