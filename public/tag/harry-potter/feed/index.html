										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li><em>As a nod to Halloween, here&#8217;s our longtime friend Libby of the wonderful <a href="http://treasuryislands.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">TreasuryIslands</a> blog &#8211; check out <a href="/tag/libby/">her previous posts for us</a>. If you have a guest post a-brewing, <a href="mailto:badrepeditors@gmail.com?subject=pitch">email us on badrepeditors@gmail.com</a>.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Representations of witches and witchcraft in literature and in popular culture generally are incredibly useful to us, providing a way of critiquing the situation of women under patriarchy that is both effective and accessible.</p>
<p>Children’s literature is particularly rife with such representations. From the wicked women of Grimm and Perrault and folkloric creations like Baba Yaga and Ceridwen, through C.S. Lewis’ Jadis and the maleficent creations of Mary de Morgan to 20th century inventions like TH White’s Madam Mim and the female students of Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry, lady sorcerers &#8211; both good and evil &#8211; have never been far from the pages of the books we have used to educate and entertain our children.</p>
<p>The witches of the classic fairytales and of the stories of the Victorian era are usually monstrous and spiteful, using their magic in service of the Devil &#8211; or worse, their own self-interest. They taunt because they can and have few, if any, redeeming characteristics.</p>
<p>In recent decades the image of the image of the witch in popular culture has undergone a transformation, in no small part due to the witches that have appeared in juvenile literature. Since the 1970s, the stories our children have read have overwhelmingly featured good witches (though the frequency with which they are presented as inept deserves some attention). These are my favourites of the modern circle.</p>
<h2>Mildred Hubble</h2>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/mildredhubble.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="14164" data-permalink="/2013/10/30/guest-post-five-witches-from-childrens-literature/mildredhubble/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/mildredhubble.jpg?fit=297%2C285&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="297,285" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="mildredhubble" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/mildredhubble.jpg?fit=297%2C285&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/mildredhubble.jpg?fit=297%2C285&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/mildredhubble.jpg?resize=297%2C285" alt="mildredhubble" width="297" height="285" class="alignright size-full wp-image-14164" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Created when Jill Murphy was a teenager, <a href="http://www.puffin.co.uk/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780141314501,00.html" target="_blank"><strong>The Worst Witch</strong></a> series follows the adventures of Mildred Hubble as she navigates the social and academic challenges of Miss Cackle’s Academy, a draughty old castle that perches atop a thickly forested mountain and ‘looks more like a prison than a school’.</p>
<p>It’s an uncomfortable enough environment for a youngster to be in, but Mildred has an added disadvantage, being marked as an outsider by her unkempt appearance and her tabby cat (given to her when the rest of the girls receive sleek black kitties).</p>
<blockquote><p>She was one of those people who always seem to be in trouble. She didn’t exactly mean to break rules and annoy the teachers, but things just seemed to happen when Mildred was around.</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>The Worst Witch</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The young witch is thoroughly well-meaning and a little too clever for her own good, but she’s also bumbling and frequently wrangling with authority figures. Despite her perceived inadequacies, there’s an air of serendipity that follows her around; her failures and misdeeds inevitably lead to a positive outcome of much greater consequence than the proceeding mishap.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is why she is so well-loved by young readers and so fondly remembered by adults. Often we can see a little of ourselves in Mildred &#8211; from her practical incompetence to her trailing shoe laces, she’s a reminder that you don’t have to be perfect to be wonderful.</p>
<h2>Mary Newbury</h2>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/witchchild.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="14152" data-permalink="/2013/10/30/guest-post-five-witches-from-childrens-literature/witchchild/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/witchchild.jpg?fit=182%2C265&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="182,265" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="witchchild" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/witchchild.jpg?fit=182%2C265&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/witchchild.jpg?fit=182%2C265&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-14152" alt="witchchild" src="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/witchchild.jpg?resize=182%2C265" width="182" height="265" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>The only work of historical fiction on my list, Celia Rees’ <a href="http://www.witchchild.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Witch Child</strong></a> is an overtly feminist text. The protagonist of the book (and its sequel, <a href="http://www.celiarees.com/books/sorceress.html" target="_blank"><strong>Sorceress</strong></a>) is Mary Newbury, an adolescent witch forced to flee to the New World following the violent death of her grandmother at the hands of<br />
witch-hunters.</p>
<p>Caught between a desire to be true to herself and the hypocrisy of Puritanism, Mary is headstrong, smart, empathetic and brave. She exhibits a tolerance that is unusual for her era and generally makes herself an excellent role model for young readers.</p>
<p>For Mary, independence poses a threat &#8211; she lives in a time that fears capable women, and her agency and determination could lead her to the same fate as her grandmother. But still she forges onwards, using her wit and her alacrity to light the way and finding friendship and love among another marginalised group.</p>
<blockquote><p>I should flee, get away. They will turn on me next unless I go. But where to? What am I to do? Lose myself. Die in the forest. I look around. Eyes, hard with hatred, slide from mine. Mouths twitch between leering and sneering. I will not run away into the forest, because that is what they want me to do.</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>Witch Child</strong></p></blockquote>
<h2>Tiffany Aching</h2>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/tiffanyachinggrannyweatherwax.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="14153" data-permalink="/2013/10/30/guest-post-five-witches-from-childrens-literature/tiffanyachinggrannyweatherwax/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/tiffanyachinggrannyweatherwax.jpg?fit=318%2C235&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="318,235" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="tiffanyachinggrannyweatherwax" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/tiffanyachinggrannyweatherwax.jpg?fit=300%2C221&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/tiffanyachinggrannyweatherwax.jpg?fit=318%2C235&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-14153" alt="tiffanyachinggrannyweatherwax" src="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/tiffanyachinggrannyweatherwax-300x221.jpg?resize=300%2C221" width="300" height="221" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/tiffanyachinggrannyweatherwax.jpg?resize=300%2C221&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/tiffanyachinggrannyweatherwax.jpg?w=318&amp;ssl=1 318w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> Terry Pratchett’s <a href="http://www.terrypratchettbooks.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Discworld</strong></a> series is often lauded as feminist; he ridicules misogyny and satirises stereotypes, he writes Strong Female Characters. But there is an incongruency to Pratchett’s feminism which undermines his intended message and ultimately, <strong>Discworld</strong> is, whisper it, <em>not that feminist</em>.</p>
<p>Tiffany Aching is, to paraphrase her creator, the most feminist of the feminists that he does not have. A child savant, she begins her witching career at nine years old when she embarks upon a quest to save her brother from a sinister fairyland <em>a la</em> <strong>Labyrinth</strong>. She’s got common sense and amazing chutzpah. While remaining a completely believable pre-teen, she’s shrewd, smart and she will not be condescended to.</p>
<blockquote><p>‘Zoology, eh? That’s a big word, isn’t it?’<br />
‘No, actually it isn’t,’ said Tiffany. ‘Patronising is a big word. Zoology is quite short.’</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>The Wee Free Men</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>As Tiffany grows up (she is approaching 16 at the time of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Shall-Wear-Midnight-Discworld-Novels/dp/0552166057" target="_blank"><strong>I Shall Wear Midnight</strong></a>) It becomes clear that she is the natural successor to Granny Weatherwax, the number one witch of the <strong>Discworld</strong> series, as she begins to display magical abilities rare in people of her age as well as exhibiting characteristics she shares with her mentor &#8211; gravitas, knowledge, a tendency towards literalism and the belief that a witch should remain single. Tiffany will ultimately become a better witch than Granny, and it is a pleasure to watch her get there.</p>
<h2>Minerva McGonagall</h2>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/SmithMcGonagallHP71.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="14155" data-permalink="/2013/10/30/guest-post-five-witches-from-childrens-literature/smithmcgonagallhp7-2/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/SmithMcGonagallHP71.jpg?fit=284%2C177&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="284,177" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="SmithMcGonagallHP7" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/SmithMcGonagallHP71.jpg?fit=284%2C177&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/SmithMcGonagallHP71.jpg?fit=284%2C177&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-14155" alt="SmithMcGonagallHP7" src="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/SmithMcGonagallHP71.jpg?resize=284%2C177" width="284" height="177" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Transfiguration Mistress &#8211; and latterly Deputy Headmistress &#8211; at Hogwarts, Minerva McGonagall is both wise and motherly, embodying a binary that women are frequently told they cannot.</p>
<p>McGonagall cares for her charges deeply, but not blindly. She is fair and ethical and has gained great respect within the Hogwarts hierarchy. She’s often sharp with students and teachers alike, she’s a keen believer in rules &#8211; without being mindlessly bound to them &#8211; and she’s a fan of order in her classroom.</p>
<p>With a witty remark or condescending quip never far from her thin lips, Minerva McGonagall is a force to be reckoned with.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8216;Oh, I can&#8217;t wait to see McGonagall inspected,&#8217; said Ron happily. &#8216;Umbridge won&#8217;t know what&#8217;s hit her.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Though she is a slight woman in her seventies, McGonagall is a fearless combatant in the battle that rages at the close of the series, directing the action and engaging directly with Voldemort in defence of the institution and the people that she loves.</p>
<p>There are many women in JK Rowling&#8217;s <strong>Harry Potter</strong> series that display fine qualities &#8211; caring and protective Mrs Weasley; book-smart Hermione; fearless Tonks; even Delores Umbridge can be admired for her sheer bloodymindedness and determination. But McGonagall seems to embody all these qualities and then some.</p>
<h2>Winnie the Witch</h2>
<blockquote><p>Winnie the Witch lived in a black house in the forest. The house was black on the outside and black on the inside. The carpets were black. The chairs were black. The bed was black and it had black sheets and black blankets. Even the bath was black.</p>
<p>Winnie lived in her black house with her cat, Wilbur. He was black too. And that is how the trouble began.</p>
<p>&#8211; <em>Winnie the Witch</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Created by Valerie Thomas and illustrated by Korky Paul, she’s a comical character by design, gangly and tall with an unruly mane of black hair and a reddened nose that I like to imagine comes from a fondness for gin. When we first meet her, she is the only colourful thing in a very dark world. A series of books for middle grade readers featuring Winnie is <a href="http://www.winnie-the-witch.com/the-authors.php" target="_blank">also available</a>, written by Laura Owen.</p>
<p>But Winnie has no qualms over using her magic to amend the world around her to suit her own purposes without considering the consequences. Winnie is heedless and impulsive, with a catch-all cry of &#8216;ABRACADABRA&#8217; that, predictably, gets her into scrapes.</p>
<p>She learns from her blunders, though, and she puts things right with grace and unerrring joy. Winnie the Witch lives a hedonistic life and she makes mistakes, but she’s always got a genuine smile on her face and that’s what makes her so refreshing.</p>

<li><em><a href="/tag/libby/"><strong>Libby</strong></a> earned her feminist stripes interning for the <a href="http://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/" target="_blank">Fawcett Society</a> where she was horrified by most of the stories she heard.

					<description><![CDATA[The fandom community is the most genre-savvy, theory-aware, innovative group of people I’ve ever had the pleasure to tangle with]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Here&#8217;s a post from <a href="http://nothingbutawordbag.wordpress.com/">Nat Guest</a>. If you have an idea for a guest post brewing in your brain, email us: <a href="mailto:badrepeditors@gmail.com?subject=Guest pitch!">badrepeditors@gmail.com</a>.</strong></p>
<p>A confession: I write fanfiction.</p>
<p>I’ll let that sink in for a moment, whilst you judge me and leap to all the usual conclusions. At least half of them will be reasonably correct.</p>
<p>For starters, let’s clear up some myths. Fanfiction isn’t about porn. Or, at least, it isn’t <em>all</em> about porn. There are as many different genres out there as there are genres of fiction, as many reasons for reading and writing it as there are readers and writers of it. And it isn’t exactly an obscure pastime; on fanfiction.net (the largest, if most mainstream and therefore frowned-upon collection of fanfic) there are 593,713 fics listed under the Harry Potter category alone.</p>

Widely derided, it’s dismissed as the home of squeeing fangirls high on sugar and manga, or else of hopeless deviants: furries, kink-seekers and the downright filthy. Both of these are, technically, perfectly accurate. Fanfiction gets a bad rep, as do its advocates, and honestly &#8211; there&#8217;s good reason for that. A lot of it is absolutely terrible (the infamous <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/my-immortal-the-worst-fanfiction-ever">My Immortal</a>, for example), and a lot of it&#8217;s cringeworthy wish-fulfilment crawling with <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue">Mary Sues</a>. But to pretend that that’s <em>all</em> it is, is to do it a huge disservice.</p>
<p>Here’s one of my favourite quotes about it, used by Sheenagh Pugh in her book <a href="http://sheenagh.webs.com/thedemocraticgenre.htm"><strong>The Democratic Genre: Fanfiction in a Literary Context</strong></a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s always been high praise in Fannish circles to be told that you wrote a story so good it should be published, but sometimes, the highest praise is that it can&#8217;t be. Its very uniqueness, what creates it, makes it impossible to be anything else. Lots of people can write stories that fall into readable (more than you think, actually, but I&#8217;m flexible on the idea of readable), and many can write stories I&#8217;d pay to read, and even some write stories that could be published and be great. But there&#8217;s this small, fascinating group that write a story that belongs only to the fandom that created it. It&#8217;s like having a treasure you never have to share. It wraps itself in the canon and fanon and the author&#8217;s own mind that created it and takes it as its own so perfectly that you are so damn glad you went into that fandom, just grateful, just absolutely thrilled, because you get to read this.</p></blockquote>
<p>Every fic, without exception, is a product of its fandom. Reading a fic is not just reading a simple story: what you’re actually reading is an intertwining of fanlore, mixing in-jokes and terminology from one particular fandom, as well as from the broader history and narrative of fandom. That’s why they can appear so incoherent and ridiculous to the outside world at times. Fanfiction authors are less writing a story than weaving together a cultural tapestry.</p>
<p>Fanfiction has a proud and noble tradition, as anyone entrenched within the community will tell you. Every student of fanlore knows where the term <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shipping_(fandom)">“ship”</a> arose (<strong>X Files</strong> fandom), and where the term <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_fiction">“slash”</a> arose (<strong>Star Trek</strong> fandom). We have our own history; from the pre-internet fanzines, to early Usenet groups, right through to the great shipping wars of <strong>Harry Potter</strong> and the arguments over whether RPF (Real Person Fic; fanfiction about “real” people) is morally acceptable (the earliest known concrete example of RPF comes from the Bronte sisters, who used to write reams of stuff about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gondal_(fictional_country)">fictional country of Gondal</a>. It can be easily argued that there was a huge amount of RPF within the oral tradition, as people passed down stories about folkloric legends such as Robin Hood, King Arthur, and &#8211; yeah, I’m going to go there &#8211; Jesus). We know our lore and our mythology and our terminology, and we study it as arduously as disciples of any other body of text.</p>
<p>Whilst I do stress that a lot of fanfiction out there is non-sexual and non-romantic in content (it’s called <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenFic">gen fic</a>, yo, look it up), there’s an inarguable trend towards sexytimes. I’m all down with that; I like a bit of story with my porn, and I’m not a very visual person, so fanfiction is where I discovered a lot about myself and my own sexuality. I think I started reading fanfiction when I was about 13 or 14, and nowhere near, ahem, “active”. My first ever ship was Rupert Giles/Jenny Calendar. It was a while after that until I discovered slash, although that discovery was, frankly, inevitable – I had a bit of a sweet-tooth for Harry/Draco (Drarry, if you will). Fanfiction was (and still is!) a safe space to explore my own sexuality, and discover the kaleidoscope of sexualities, genders and identities that are out there. It was many years before I’d hear the name Judith Butler, or even hear the slightest mention of ‘queer theory’, but when I did, none of the ideas seemed particularly new to me.</p>
<p>Whilst there are plenty of male writers of fanfiction (especially within the gaming community &#8211; shout out to my little bro!) authorship is overwhelmingly female, and I don’t think that that’s a coincidence. Out in the real world, it’s difficult to own our own sexuality; there’s simply no room for shades of grey. You’re either frigid or a slut; you’re either straight or gay; your sexuality and identity is whatever people perceive when they look at you. But within the fanfiction community, away from the patriarchal mainstream, we can discover and explore how we feel about our own sexual and gender and personal identity. That’s something that I think has had more effect on my life than anything else. Through the medium of fandom, we can find out who we are, and what we like, and how we feel, all through just reading stories together. And then hopefully &#8211; eventually &#8211; we get to write our own story.</p>
<p>This is people writing because they love it, for no purpose other than writing for themselves and for other people who they vaguely know on the internet. It’s done purely for the joy of the thing. And it isn&#8217;t just about the fic itself; the fandom community is the most genre-savvy, theory-aware, innovative group of people I’ve ever had the pleasure to tangle with. This is a community alive with discussion about narrative, metanarrative, referentialism &#038; self referentialism, literary theory, gender and sexuality, social justice, morality, pop culture and in-jokes. I’d also argue that it’s an innately queer community; it not only exists between the cracks, but thrives on the cracks. And in a world where deconstruction and theory are often frowned upon as &#8220;thinking about things too much&#8221;, fandom is where I found a home.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Guest post time again: regular reader Russell reminds us why Angela Carter should still be on your Essential Reading list, or if you&#8217;ve never read her, why you should start&#8230;</strong></em></p>
<blockquote><p>The tiger will never lie down with the lamb; he acknowledges no pact that is not reciprocal. The lamb must learn to run with the tigers.</p>
<p>&#8211; Angela Carter, <strong>The Tiger’s Bride</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Fairy tales weren’t always Disney cartoons. Once upon a time, they were part of an oral tradition passed down from mother to child, cautionary tales about the horrors that lurked in the woods, and the dangers of going off the path. They were much bloodier back then, much scarier, and with a lot more impact. Then along came the Brothers Grimm and Hans Anderson, and other men who liked writing things down and only wrote down what they liked. The fairy tales got sillier from there, cautionary tales without any of the blood and violence that made them worth paying heed to in the first place. They only got worse with Disney (though some of us love Disney movies, occasionally even with <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0398286/">good reason</a>).</p>

Modern authors have taken the sanitised narratives we were all told as kids, and twisted them, into something we recognise but appreciate in a very different way. They’re still the stories we know, but not only has the blood and gore reappeared, they’ve grown up in much the same way as our society has grown up. Rather than warning our children that they should stick to the route life’s prepared for them, walk the road to happy marriage and 2.4 kids, they instead encourag stepping away from the traditional routes, rebelling against authority, and reclaiming traditional feminine roles which are often painted in a negative light. Or they tell grown-up stories about characters traditionally relegated to the most sanitised view of childhood. There are countless modern fables which also play much the same roles as traditional folk tales, from the insanely popular wizard kids of <strong>Harry Potter</strong> to fables shrouded in mystery and played on a concept album.</p>
<p>Through all of this, there’s one book which, in my opinion, has succeeded in reclaiming stories once used to repress and control women (and by extension everyone else) to a far greater extent than any other: Angela Carter’s <strong>The Bloody Chamber</strong>. As Carter herself asserted, the stories therein are not simply updated or “adult” versions of the traditional stories (she really hated this idea). Rather, they build on the essence of the originals; not those set down by the likes of Perrault, but the <em>original</em> stories, those told in the oral tradition. From a linguistic or anthropological point of view, it’s a fascinating experiment: how would those stories have evolved and changed over the years if the game of Chinese whispers that is oral storytelling hadn’t been brought to a stop?</p>
<p>The result, updated versions of Bluebeard, Beauty and the Beast (twice), Puss In Boots, Snow White (kinda), Red Riding Hood (two or three times), plus a vampire story and a sort of<br />
Red Riding Hood/Alice Through The Looking Glass amalgam, is a brilliantly charged piece of work. Charged emotionally, through our strongly forged connection to these stories; charged sexually, through the transition of the stories from cautionary tales to fables of teenage awakening; and crammed with ideas and themes, many of which it’s fair to say would be beyond the young minds to which these stories were once told. Instead of telling children how to behave themselves, they tell adults how not to behave themselves.</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, the traditional versions of these stories are very often about staying “on the path”, the course society sets for an individual based on their gender and circumstances. Nowhere is this more evident than in the traditional Red Riding Hood story; a little girl follows a shortcut through the woods, deviating from the way she’s been told to go, and as a result she and a matriarchal figure are murdered by a vicious beast, or rescued by a male hero who is otherwise absent from the story. In Carter’s versions, the little girl leaves the path, and the rewards, while terrifying, are great. In <strong>The Company of Wolves</strong>, the wolf becomes an image of feral sexuality, with the adolescent Red Riding Hood sleeping with him at the end. In<strong> The Werewolf</strong>, Granny herself is the wolf; a certain metaphor for how traditional ideas of the feminine role are monstrous &#8211; Red Riding Hood kills her, and inherits all her stuff. In <strong>Wolf Alice</strong>, which merges a variant of the story with elements of <strong>Through The Looking Glass</strong>, the titular character emerges from a feral childhood, not into the socialised womanhood which the nuns taking care of her demand, but instead redeeming the vampiric Duke in whose care she is left by the power of her sexual awakening.</p>
<p>Sexual power is a primary theme in many of the stories. Carter refutes the view of female sexuality as passive and submissive; such sex is presented as a sterile, pleasureless experience. The titular story, and also the longest, goes into this in detail with a version of the Bluebeard story set in the 1930s. The narrator, also the heroine, marries the familiar murderer. Rather than merely dying, as in some versions of the fairy tale, or being rescued by a male saviour, it is her mother, a badass world-travelling tiger hunter, who comes to the rescue. The “saviour male” is replaced with a blind piano tuner who ultimately becomes the heroine’s lover, taking the sexual emphasis away from the visual with which Bluebeard is so obsessed, and placing it firmly where it belongs: in the realm of the sensual.</p>

I have to say this is probably my favourite story in the collection, with its beautiful emphasis on primal power and strength rather than civilised control. Beauty is at first an object, a thing given to the Beast to repay a gambling debt. It’s through her own acknowledgement and understanding of her bestial side that she claims freedom, and achieves her transformation, which in a reversal of the traditional fairy tale beast transformation is not a horrifying punishment, but a liberating reward.</p>
<p>In many ways, these stories aren’t for children. They’re complex narratives which many adults would struggle with. On the other hand, these stories, which challenge the expected ideas and cautionary tales of behaving like good girls and boys, are in a way exactly what we should be telling our kids: there are terrible things out there, <em>and some of them are you.</em> It’s no longer worth staying on the path. It’s time to explore the woods.<br />
<strong><br />
New to Carter? Other things to try: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Company of Wolves</strong> was turned<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087075/"> into a film</a>, although it’s more based on Carter’s radio version of the story.  Contains more fairy tales, and is a better werewolf movie than <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/04/22/at-the-movies-red-riding-hood/">some recent films</a>.</li>
<li> For more Angela Carter, there&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Magic-Toyshop-Virago-modern-classics/dp/0860681904/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1304358762&#038;sr=1-1"><strong>The Magic Toyshop</strong></a></li>
<li> For more modified, subversive fairy tales, you could do worse than check out <strong>Neil Gaiman</strong>.  His short story <strong>Snow, Glass, Apples</strong>, which is available in <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Smoke-Mirrors-Neil-Gaiman/dp/0755322835/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1304613941&#038;sr=1-3"><strong>Smoke and Mirrors</strong></a>, recasts Snow White as a vampire.  He’s also tackled a number of other fairy tales from various cultures in his numerous different works, and written a few fables of his own that aren’t too far removed.</li>
</ul>
