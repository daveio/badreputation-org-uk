										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am supposed to be writing about <strong>Bioshock Infinite</strong> right now (which is amazing and you should all play it right bloody now) but then, something happened.</p>
<p>Something long-awaited, occasionally hoaxed, but nobody was ever entirely sure would ever come to pass&#8230;THE SUN CAME OUT AND SPRING ARRIVED IN THE UK, FINALLY. And also there was the death of 87-year-old Margaret Thatcher of a stroke at the end of a protracted illness.</p>
<p>And lo, the internet did have a field day. Twitter was a maelstrom of popping corks, whitewashing of one of the darkest times post-war Britain has faced, and joyous choruses of <em>that</em> song from The Wizard of Oz, all alongside expressions of disgust for every aspect of the reaction. The 8<sup>th</sup> of April 2013 will go down in Twitter history as a bona fide fustercluck.</p>

<p>The <strong>New Statesman</strong> ran a brief and to-the-point piece about whether or not Thatcher <a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/archive/2013/04/margaret-thatcher-feminist-icon" target="_blank">could or should be considered a feminist icon</a>. In the words of the Iron Lady herself, “I hate feminism. It is poison.”</p>
<p>So far, so cut-and-dry. But her words have been niggling at me somewhat. She&#8217;s not the first woman to denounce and distance herself from feminism. Nor will she be the last. But I cannot help but wonder what would drive a woman who would never have reached her position without feminism to speak out against it with such contempt.</p>
<p>While we can now only speculate on why her personal views were what they were, I&#8217;m reminded of a few arguments I hear with disheartening frequency about why feminism isn&#8217;t needed and why feminists need to shut up.</p>
<p>Spoilers: I am neither moved nor convinced by any of them.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> “<b>I don&#8217;t need feminism. We have the vote. It&#8217;s done. Women are totes equal. Get over it.</b>”</p>
<p>This line of reasoning barely dignifies a response beyond pointing out, somewhat wearily, that it&#8217;s demonstrably untrue. Whether we&#8217;re talking pay gaps, sexual abuse, street harassment, representation in politics, assumptions about childcare arrangements or anything else in an endless list of smaller inequalities adding up to a great big unequal world. Yes, women in the UK have it better than at any point in the past; no, that doesn&#8217;t mean that equality has happened.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> “<b>I&#8217;m just &#8216;one of the lads&#8217; in my social group/place of work. Feminists are trying to drive a wedge between me and the men in my life by making a fuss over nothing.”</b></p>
<p>It is wonderful to be accepted as socially or professionally equal to men. Yet I felt bile rising in my throat as I typed that. Being “one of the lads”, while harmless on the face of it, is an argument that has some rather unpleasant meanings once you place it under scrutiny. It panders directly to the “man, rather than person, as default” rhetoric that pervades almost every corner of our society.</p>
<p>This line of reasoning erases feminine identities and elevates stereotypically masculine traits or interests as something one should aspire to and work towards, something essential for social acceptance. There is internalised misogyny afoot every time a self-proclaimed “ladette” crows about chugging pints of beer, watching a match, ogling boobs or besting her boyfriend at <strong>Modern Warfare 2</strong>. The heavily implied sentiment here is “these are all MAN things and I am more like a MAN for doing them and that puts me above all of you feminists trying to spoil my fun.”</p>
<p>None of these activities are inherently “gendered”, and the fact you behave like they are is sort-of-kind-of-rather undermining those of us genuinely striving for equality.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> “<b>Everybody should be judged on merit. Feminism is trying to give women a leg-up over men and that is unfair!”</b></p>
<p>Yes, the promotion of one group of people over another based on nothing but their attributes at birth is inherently unfair, and no, this is not what the majority of feminists want.</p>
<p>Feminists LIKE men. In fact, plenty of feminists ARE men. Feminism is about reaching equality, or parity, whatever you want to call it. It is a movement against the oppression of hundreds of years. In most fields of employment, and certainly at the highest levels, women are underrepresented. If you really believe that we already exist in a meritocracy, how else could you account for this disparity without the spurious notion that “men are just better at everything, LOL”?</p>
<p>Feminists are not seeking to take anything away from men: they are simply trying to level the still-slanted playing field so that the ball stops rolling into the men&#8217;s goal by default. Sure, it&#8217;s not the vertiginous cliff face it once was, but the angle of elevation still very much favours the dudes. If you want a meritocracy, you have to submit to its conditions. If you believe the only way you can succeed is by ensuring that the oppressive status quo is maintained, then you may need to revisit your understanding of the term “individual merit.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>These are just three of the more common arguments I hear. From women with whom I am friends, it&#8217;s troubling, but can at least be the start of a constructive dialogue. From women in the public eye, however, from politician to pop star, these are toxic messages that reinforce oppression and can thwart the ambitions of girls and women.</p>
<p>The cognitive shift from “Hey, I can do that, and I happen to be a girl!” to “I would like to do that, but I&#8217;m a girl” may sound subtle, but its impact is potentially devastating. The dismissive words of a high-achieving female role model can make all the difference, so it&#8217;s vital that we understand that these women would not be where they are today without feminism and that their public declarations show a fundamental lack of understanding about the ongoing struggle for equality.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I wanted to write not about Thatcher, but about representations of her.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I can&#8217;t write a political or historical retrospective on Thatcher, on her life or her works. If I did, it might come out like <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/apr/09/russell-brand-margaret-thatcher?INTCMP=SRCH" target="_blank">the Russell Brand piece</a>, only a bit more Northern, a bit more reflective on her impact on feminism.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve read and seen far too much already over the past few days, from endless eulogies in the papers through to angry words on the street and in the House of Commons. The truth is I am genuinely shaken by it. Like the Queen Mother, she was one of those figures we all suspected might go on forever, and her shadow was long. With it gone, one of the touchpoints for my personal politics is gone.</p>
<p>I started to think about how I might even begin to parse what has happened: I&#8217;m not sad, but I&#8217;ll admit I didn&#8217;t crack open the champagne personally; I merely drank someone else&#8217;s.So in a similar vein, I wanted to write not about her, but about representations of her.</p>
<h2>Maggie&#8217;s Farm</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/maggiesfarmcover.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="13514" data-permalink="/2013/04/15/images-of-an-iron-lady/maggiesfarmcover/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/maggiesfarmcover.jpg?fit=250%2C176&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="250,176" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="maggiesfarmcover" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/maggiesfarmcover.jpg?fit=250%2C176&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/maggiesfarmcover.jpg?fit=250%2C176&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-13514 aligncenter" alt="Cover for Steve Bell's Maggie's Farm" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/maggiesfarmcover.jpg?resize=250%2C176" width="250" height="176" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to start with one of my favourite political cartoonists. Alongside his later portrayal of her puppeteering Tony Blair, comic artist <a href="http://www.belltoons.co.uk/books" target="_blank">Steve Bell</a> also focuses on her controlling authority. He wrote a series called <strong>Maggie&#8217;s Farm</strong> which depicted her as completely insane &#8211; with trademark wonky eye and multiple exclamation points in her speech.</p>
<p>The comics, which reference Dylan&#8217;s song of the same title (which was in itself used as a protest song against Thatcher) were originally published in <strong>Time Out</strong> from 1979, and, to my eye, probably heavily influenced later depictions.</p>
<h2>Spitting Image</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Magaret-Thatcher.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="13515" data-permalink="/2013/04/15/images-of-an-iron-lady/magaret-thatcher/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Magaret-Thatcher.jpg?fit=462%2C353&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="462,353" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Magaret Thatcher" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Magaret-Thatcher.jpg?fit=300%2C229&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Magaret-Thatcher.jpg?fit=462%2C353&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-13515 aligncenter" alt="Spitting Image's version of Thatcher" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Magaret-Thatcher.jpg?resize=370%2C282" width="370" height="282" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>The first time I saw <strong>Spitting Image</strong> I was hooked, probably helped by the fact my parents told me I wasn&#8217;t allowed to watch it, and to this day I regret that it has gone off the air. Perhaps it&#8217;s because no satire is strong enough to be distinguished from the ridiculous facts of today&#8217;s government? Anyway, back to Thatcher.</p>
<p>The depiction of her was grotesque, but no more so than that of any other puppet on the show. That said, it was the <em>nature</em> of the grotesque that interested me.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/jINZBOxdja8" height="360" width="480" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>She was ridiculed for her strength and controlling nature in the form of a horrific headmistress. It&#8217;s interesting to note that later John Major was ridiculed for his <em>lack</em> of strength.</p>
<p>But rather than this being portrayed as an essential part of her it was represented in reference to Thatcher as a woman  (note the ongoing references to her as &#8220;sir&#8221;). Her strength was ridiculed, in part, by presenting it as &#8220;unfeminine&#8221; and therefore funny or dangerous: a stereotype of women in politics that will no doubt take many years to overturn. <a href="http://spittingimage.wikia.com/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher" target="_blank">As the series moved on she became less and less human</a>, eventually turning into an alien monster.</p>

<h2>The Old Iron Woman</h2>

<p>Raymond Briggs delivers a rendition of the Falklands War in a way that is moving, vitriolic, frightening and humbling in his 1984 piece <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tin-Pot_Foreign_General_and_the_Old_Iron_Woman" target="_blank"><strong>The Tin Pot Foreign General and The Old Iron Woman</strong></a>.</p>
<p>What I find particularly interesting here is how her depiction contrasts with that of <strong>Spitting Image</strong>. Both use the &#8220;non-human&#8221; references, but whereas the <strong>Spitting Image</strong> Thatcher is usually either asexual or very masculine, here she is quite the opposite. Guns and victory explosions fire from her breasts as she squats (in high heels, with rounded buttocks and suspenders, no less) over her land and nation in a parody of birth. The conflation of female and war-machine gives rise to a gross, highly sexualised fembot.</p>

<h2>The Iron Lady</h2>

<p>I returned from holiday just over a year ago to find London distressingly covered in images of Meryl Streep in <strong>The Iron Lady</strong>, with her icy blue eyes following me all over the place. It haunted me, <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/01/10/on-thatcher-icons-and-iron-ladies-rhian-jones/">in much the same way as it did our Rhian Jones</a> (I&#8217;ll admit it, I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to see the film).</p>
<p>It was the glossiness of the whole thing that threw me, the vogue-ish fashion magazine stylings that worked their hardest to reunite those twin features of &#8220;female&#8221; and &#8220;powerful&#8221; which had created such horrors through both <strong>Spitting Image</strong> and at the pencil of Raymond Briggs. And they succeeded in being very flattering, through a combination of make-up and airbrushing.</p>
<p>Streep is noticeably less wrinkled and more attractively-styled than Thatcher, looking eerily like a better-looking sister. The situation was enhanced by Streep&#8217;s own acting ability, and a script which included scenes of feminine domesticity.</p>
<h2>What next?</h2>
<p>I never knew her. Never met her. I only understood her as a series of images and icons, on the television as a politician and in other representations of her, which are more numerous than I can contain in one article. Buzzfeed, for example, <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/angelameiquan/21-incredibly-angry-songs-about-margaret-thatcher">collected a list of songs about her</a>. Like many other dead, famous people, over time she will fade from a real person, who nonetheless was one of the bogeymen of my childhood (alongside the boggle-faced baddie animals in <a href="http://www.80snostalgia.com/orm-and-cheep/"><strong>Orm and Cheep</strong></a>) to being almost imaginary, an icon.</p>
<p>To me, she will always be the figurehead for all that is wrong with right wing thinking and the sort of &#8220;feminism&#8221; that claims it must be feminist if a woman is doing it. Those with opposing politics have put her on a pedestal. Other people will make her into other things.</p>
<p>I doubt we&#8217;ve seen the last representation, but I&#8217;ll be interested which version of Margaret Thatcher will stand the test of time, and which version we will be faced with next.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This month just gone, political party conference season has been coupled with the return of political comedy <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qgrd" target="_blank"><strong>The Thick of It</strong></a> – still one of the only remaining reasons for watching TV – so I’ve been having some quick and disjointed thoughts about women and contemporary UK politics.</p>
<p>As a Welsh expatriate, I was surprised but interested to discover that there are now more women in <a href="http://bronglais.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/plaid-cymrus-women-leaders.html">leadership positions</a> in the Welsh Nationalist party <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaid_Cymru">Plaid Cymru</a> than there are in the UK Cabinet.</p>

<p>After September’s reshuffle, Theresa May remains as Home Secretary, a role in which she has occasionally <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-12296269">talked a good game</a> but done <a href="http://brightgreenscotland.org/index.php/2012/06/why-theresa-mays-immigration-proposals-are-a-feminist-issue/">little</a> <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-scraps-power-to-ban-domestic-abusers-from-victims-homes-2042596.html">materially</a> to endear herself to women. Maria Miller’s appointment as Minister for Culture, Media and Sport, as well as Minister for Women and Equalities, got off to a flying start when an unexacting series of anti-equality accusations against her went viral; even if the list was badly and disingenuously worded, <a href="http://fullfact.org/articles/facebook_maria_miller_minister_equality_homophobia_racism-28089">the facts behind it</a> still don’t exactly fill one with confidence in her. The high-profile irritant Louise Mensch, meanwhile, has given up on a parliamentary career after serving just over two years of her term. So much for ‘Tory feminism’.</p>
<p>The UK is currently ranked 57th <a href="http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/classif.htm">here</a>, and has never been spectacular at getting women into government. As of early 2012, women represented only 16% of Conservative MPs and 31% of Labour MPs – but what does the number of women in government mean?</p>
<p>Gender parity is obviously not synonymous with strategic influence or decision-making power, and, particularly after <a href="www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/01/10/on-thatcher-icons-and-iron-ladies-rhian-jones/">Exhibit M</a>, it&#8217;s slightly preposterous to think that a particular demographic will vote or make policy according to gender rather than ideology. </p>
<p>The current government itself has provided examples of this, with some of its most prominent and media-friendly female MPs – step forward Nadine Dorries – also pushing the harshest lines on reproductive or employment rights. All of which strengthens the argument for viewing and judging the actions of female politicians on an individual basis, rather than viewing them all as an undifferentiated flash of eye candy whose political presence is considered automatically progressive. This last trope reached its probable peak, as did so much bland but deeply damaging smuggery, under Tony Blair and his insipid cohort of ‘Blair&#8217;s Babes’. In France, this year&#8217;s slightly more optimistic victory for the Socialist Party under Francois Hollande has nevertheless drawn comparisons with New Labour&#8217;s use of women MPs as relatively powerless tokens of progressiveness:</p>
<blockquote><p>In an article entitled “The irritating photo”, Isabelle Germain asks why these highly qualified women are being treated like Hollande’s trophies. Just like the ‘Blair Babes’, Hollande’s female ministers have their own twee media nickname; the ‘Hollandettes’. Linguistically, the ‘Hollandettes’ are to Hollande what ‘Beliebers’ are to the pop star Justin Beiber – relative to their male leader and their roles determined by his authority. – <a href="http://francefemmesfeminisme.wordpress.com/2012/05/18/blairs-babes-and-the-hollandettes-spot-the-difference/">Source</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Even for a place so historically rife with sniggering male privilege and suspended adolescence as the House of Commons, the language and attitudes recently faced by female MPs has been some of the most patronising for years – not least the current Prime Minister instructing Labour MP Angela Eagle to ‘Calm down, dear’ and not even bothering to acknowledge a question from the admittedly objectionable Nadine Dorries, instead dismissing her with the snide innuendo ‘I realise the honourable lady is frustrated’. Not that female parliamentarians should automatically be given an easy ride (hur hur), but neither should their opponents draw so instinctively and with quite so much entitled relish on lazy and reactionary stereotypes of hysteria and frustration as a means of avoiding the issues they wish to raise.</p>

<p>Perhaps of a piece with the deeply retrograde, public school and debating club roots of the present government, we seem to be seeing a renewed emphasis on the idea of politics as an adversarial, point-scoring arena in which women are ill-equipped to spar. This kind of thing is part of what <strong>The Thick Of It</strong> subverts and satirises so well. For all the show’s scattergun profanity, and the ‘violent sexual imagery’ and Freudian nightmares in its characters’ verbal volleys, the majority of humour in <strong>The Thick Of It</strong>is derived not from the successful exercise of power but from impotence and frustration.</p>
<p>In addition, <a href="http://calitreview.com/30599">as Jem Bloomfield has noted elsewhere</a>, there’s the extent to which the Lib-Dem avatars’ try-hard laddishness and awkward stabs at dick-swinging plays into their dislikeability – Roger Allam’s shire-tastic Peter Mannion MP, for all his downtrodden One Nation Tory-out-of-time woes, manages to exude more patrician authority than either of them. Overtly chauvinist or patronising attitudes are the preserve of characters, like the awkwardly overfamiliar Steve Fleming, whom the viewer is invited to regard with contempt.</p>
<p>Like <strong>The League of Gentlemen</strong> before it, <strong>The Thick Of It</strong>’s female grotesques are no less venal or useless or dim or inane than their male counterparts. Besides giving as good as they get, the show&#8217;s women, in the current series in particular, tend to crop up as self-possessed and efficient centres of competence within a given episode’s crisis and clusterfuck, whether it&#8217;s Terri’s brisk and matronly, almost instinctive civil servant’s professionalism, or Emma’s ruthless and steely slither up her party’s ladder of opportunity.</p>
<p>The exception to this is of course Rebecca Front&#8217;s portrayal of the well-meaning but hapless Nicola Murray MP, first introduced as a Minister put out to grass and now floundering as Leader of the Opposition. Chronically lacking in self-belief, ideas or ideology, beset by power-hungry underlings and colleagues, and unsupported by her offscreen husband, Murray is almost painfully unsuited for the environment in which she finds herself having to operate – but so, crucially, is Peter Mannion, and so was Murray’s forerunner, the spectacularly hangdog Hugh Abbott.</p>

<p>She has the odd display of offhand feminist snark (‘I love the division of labour in here – how the women do the heavy lifting and the men do the heavy sarcasm’), and the occasional pointedly gender-aware exchange with the show’s alpha male antihero Malcolm Tucker, but Murray’s incompetence and ineffectualness is never presented as a function of her being that well-worn cliché, a woman in a man’s world. It is simply the tragedy of several characters that they exist in a political and media world in which those who flourish are flavourless post-Blair clones like the largely unseen Dan Miller.</p>
<p>I haven’t seen a great deal written about <strong>The Thick Of It</strong>’s sexual politics – if there is any out there, do let us know in a comment. Returning to reality, it remains to be seen what effect the predominance of women in Plaid Cymru’s leadership is likely to have. Leanne Woods, Plaid&#8217;s first female leader, is refreshing enough for her unabashed socialist and republican ideals – although these principles are very much not common to the whole party.</p>
<p>Woods has attracted the always-dubious label of &#8216;outspoken&#8217;; like &#8216;feisty&#8217; or the old favourite ‘pushy’, when I hear the word &#8216;outspoken&#8217; used of a woman in public life I don’t exactly reach for my revolver but I certainly roll my eyes. in 2004 she was, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/democracylive/hi/historic_moments/newsid_8199000/8199372.stm">mildly ridiculously</a>, ordered to leave the Welsh Assembly&#8217;s debating chamber for referring to the Queen as &#8216;Mrs Windsor&#8217;. Even if you find a constitutional route to socialism more implausible than the idea of impending Welsh independence, Plaid are at least providing an example of how commitment to social justice can be combined with a commitment to gender representation, with both intertwined as strands of the same progressive goal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A spectre is haunting London. My daily commute, never a joyful affair, has recently been lent a further dimension of irritation by adverts on buses, hoving into view with tedious regularity, bearing the image of <strong>Meryl Streep</strong> dolled up as Mrs Thatcher in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1007029/"><strong>The Iron Lady</strong></a>. Thirty years on from Thatcher&#8217;s rise to power, and after a minor rash of small-screen depictions – Andrea Riseborough in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1067578/"><strong>The Long Walk to Finchley</strong></a>, Lindsay Duncan in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1230150/"><strong>Margaret</strong></a> &#8211; Streep will now portray her on the big screen, the prospect of which I could have happily lived without.</p>
<p>Having as I do <a href="http://velvetcoalmine.wordpress.com/2011/09/19/the-pits-and-the-pendulum/">firsthand experience</a> of the impact of Thatcher’s thirteen years, her government’s break with prevailing consensus and bloody-minded devotion to neoliberal orthodoxies, an objective and rational evaluation of the woman is probably beyond me. That said, her presumably impending death &#8211; although I do have a longstanding appointment at a pub in King&#8217;s Cross to dutifully raise a glass &#8211; is something to which I&#8217;ll be largely indifferent. It won&#8217;t matter. Thatcher as a person has far less bearing on the current world than what she represents. The damage has been done, the battle lost, and much as I might appreciate a Truth and Reconciliation Commission into the 1980s, Thatcher and her co-conspirators are by now <a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/steven-baxter/2011/12/decisions-away-information">too old and whiskey-soaked</a> to be held to any meaningful account.</p>
<p>Efforts to humanise Thatcher, even when they enlist Meryl Streep, seem discomfiting and deeply bizarre. What she means has transcended what she was, is and will be. The purpose of this post, therefore, apart from being an exercise in detachment for me, is to look briefly at some aspects of Thatcher’s image in political and pop culture, and to consider the effect of her gender on her role as a woman in power. Quick, before the next bus goes past.</p>
<h3>The Icon Lady</h3>
<blockquote><p>Meanings of all kinds flow through the figures of women, and they often do not include who she herself is.</p>
<p>&#8211; Marina Warner, <strong>Monuments and Maidens</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Thatcher’s visual staying power in political and pop culture is as great as her impact on <a href="http://johnrobb77.wordpress.com/2009/06/16/how-margaret-thatcher-changed-pop-culture-for-ever/">oppositional music</a>. The face of Thatcher most often called to mind is that of what Angela Carter termed her ‘balefully iconic’ post-1983 premiership: encased in true-blue power suits, wielding a handbag, her hair lacquered into immobile submission, her earlier style solidified into a heavily stylized femininity bordering on drag. Paul Flynn, in a <a href="http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/paul_flynn/2006/05/by_paul_flynn.html">fairly tortured discussion</a> of Thatcher’s status as a gay icon, put it down to her ‘ability to carry a strong, identifiable, signature look&#8230; an intrinsic and steely power to self-transform’, and a ‘camp, easily cartooned presence’. The startling evocative power of this look, its ability to summon up its host of contemporary social, cultural and political associations, is why I jump when Streep&#8217;s replication of it intrudes into my vision. It’s like being repeatedly sideswiped by the 1980s, which is something the last UK election had already made me thoroughly sick of.</p>

The artist Alison Jackson <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/feb/11/margaret-thatcher-meryl-streep-photograph">observes</a> that all three &#8216;had what it takes to become a modern icon: big hair, high foreheads and a face that would allow you to project your own fears and desires on to it.&#8217; Conversely, subsequent political leaders &#8211; including both <a href="http://cvcl.mit.edu/hybrid_gallery/tatcher_blair.html">Blair</a> and <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_OVzuV6XUReA/TJ0EjTQ29WI/AAAAAAAAARU/SOy8bXxatls/s1600/Cameron-Thatcher.png">Cameron</a> &#8211; have had their own faces conflated with Thatcher’s, usually as part of left-wing critiques meant to signify the closeness of their policies to hers. Thatcher’s image is here used as an instantly recognisable political signifier, communicating a set of ideological ideas in a single package, as well as a self-contained political warning sign.</p>
<p>Although the kind of passive objectification associated with Monroe might seem at odds with the idea of Thatcher as a great historical actor with narrative agency in her own right, the images of both women are used in a cultural tradition in which the female figure in particular becomes a canvas for the expression of abstract ideas (think justice, liberty, victory). The abstract embodiment of multiple meanings, and the strategic performance of traditional ideas of femininity, constitute sources of power which Thatcher and her political and media allies exploited to the hilt in their harnessing of support for the policies she promoted.</p>
<h3>Iron Maidens</h3>
<p>Thatcher’s image, rather than appealing solely to a particular aspect of femininity, was a tense mixture of conflicting and mutually reinforcing signifiers. Angela Carter <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/46831407/Angela-Carter-Shaking-a-Leg">identified</a> it as a composite of feminine archetypes, including <strong>Dynasty</strong>’s Alexis Carrington, Elizabeth I as Gloriana, Countess Dracula, and one of PG Wodehouse’s aunts – tropes sharing a certain type of burlesqued and grotesque dragon-femininity. The 1981 Falklands conflict allowed the discourse around Thatcher to reference the precedents of both Queen Victoria and Churchill, and she was photographed on a tank in an <a href="http://iconicphotos.wordpress.com/2009/04/23/thatcher-in-a-tank/">image</a> that the <strong>Daily Telegraph</strong> described as ‘a cross between Isadora Duncan and Lawrence of Arabia’.</p>
<p>Justine Picardie, in a <a href="http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/article/TMG8940986/The-Making-of-The-Iron-Ladys-Wardrobe.html">grimly fascinating read</a>, roots Thatcher’s style in the rigid grooming of well-turned-out 1950s femininity in general and her sartorially plain Methodist upbringing in particular:</p>
<blockquote><p>Interviewed by Dr Miriam Stoppard for Yorkshire Television in 1985, she gave a glimpse of a childhood desire for the luxury of colour, and shop-bought extravagance, whether a new dress or sofa cover: &#8216;that was a great expenditure and a great event. So you went out to choose them, and you chose something that looked really rather lovely, something light with flowers on it. My mother: &#8220;That&#8217;s not serviceable.&#8221; And how I longed for the time when I could buy things that were not serviceable.&#8217;</p></blockquote>
<p>Even at the height of her political power, she chose to retain the ‘pretty’ and ‘softening’ effects of her trademark <a href="http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/galleries/TMG8946898/Margaret-Thatchers-style-over-the-years.html">horrible bows</a>. Alongside this tendency towards aspirational frivolity, she cultivated connotations of the provincial housewife – a ‘Housewife Superstar’ – wearing an apron while on the campaign trail and being shown washing dishes while contesting the party leadership. </p>
<p>Her ‘Iron Lady’ speech distinctly echoed the ‘body of a weak and feeble woman&#8230; heart and stomach of a king’ construction <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_to_the_Troops_at_Tilbury">associated with Elizabeth I</a> in its drawing on the tension between conflicting signifiers:</p>
<blockquote><p>I stand before you tonight in my Red Star chiffon evening gown, my face softly made up and my fair hair gently waved, the Iron Lady of the Western World. A cold war warrior, an Amazon philistine, even a Peking plotter. Well, am I any of those things? Yes&#8230; Yes, I am an iron lady, after all it wasn&#8217;t a bad thing to be an iron duke.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Not a Man to Match Her?</h3>
<p>Thatcher&#8217;s courting of various feminine roles did not prevent the assigning of masculine attributes to her – notably in oppositional parodies and satire. Her iconic <strong>Spitting Image</strong> puppet was shown wearing a suit and tie and smoking a cigar, addressed as &#8216;Sir&#8217;, and given a more or less explicit emasculating effect upon male colleagues and political opponents:</p>
<p><iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/OyU8qmzGsEg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Outside satire, the 1984 Miners&#8217; Strike has been conceptualised both as a <a href="http://deathatthemall.wordpress.com/2011/12/16/men-at-war-mark-simpson-examines-masculinity-and-the-miners-strike/">mass emasculation</a> of ordinary male miners <em>and</em> an overt bout of cock-duelling between Thatcher and miners&#8217; leader Arthur Scargill, each of whom were criticised for an absolutist and stubbornly Napoleonic approach to the conflict rather than a more ‘feminine’ openness to negotiation and compromise.</p>
<p>As Dawn Fowler <a href="http://eprints.uwe.ac.uk/7817/">notes</a> in her consideration of dramatic treatments of the Falklands War, a problem with such portrayals of Thatcher is that she &#8216;can be represented as simply denying her true feminine self in favour of a crazed fascist agenda.&#8217; <strong>The Comic Strip</strong>’s <a href="http://gaffa.org/dreaming/glc.html">satirical take</a> on Thatcher’s battles with Ken Livingstone and the Greater London Council presented her as the victim of alien or demonic possession, the ending of which left her soft and passive – restored to her presumably appropriate, natural form. Both applauding Thatcher for her ability to overcome &#8216;traditional&#8217; feminine weakness and irrationality and behave symbolically as a man, and castigating her for her failure or suppression of a &#8216;true&#8217; soft and accommodating female nature, are equally dubious in the qualities they seek to assign to &#8216;real&#8217; women.</p>
<blockquote><p>Thatcher was repeatedly likened to a female impersonator, a man in blue dresses. The reason for this is simple, and apparently shatterproof: we have so firmly linked power and masculinity that we think a powerful woman is a category error. Instead of changing our ideas about power, we change the sex of a powerful woman. </p>
<p>&#8211; <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2011/dec/09/marilyn-monroe-margaret-thatcher-biopics"><strong>Sarah Churchwell</strong></a></p></blockquote>
<h3>No Job for a Lady?</h3>
<p>While Thatcher’s election to Prime Minister was of course a landmark for women in politics, her much-vaunted &#8216;grocer&#8217;s daughter&#8217; outsider status was mediated through an Oxford education and marriage into wealth. The number of prominent women serving as MPs and Cabinet ministers prior to or alongside Thatcher &#8211; Nancy Astor, Margaret Bondfield, Betty Harvie Anderson, Jenny Lee, Barbara Castle to name a few – make her ascension exceptional but not unique. Nor should Thatcher’s progress in the male-dominated world of British politics obscure how little she actually did for women once in office: the lack of women appointed to ministerial positions; her disparaging of ‘strident Women’s Libbers’; her invariably male ideological protégés. Historian Helen Castor, <a href="http://thebrowser.com/interviews/helen-castor-on-queens-and-power?page=3">discussing</a> the ‘extraordinary’ parallels between the iconography of Thatcher and that of Elizabeth I, points out that both women emphasised themselves as the exception to a rule:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;what those two women both did was not say, Women can rule, women can hold power. They both said, Yes, OK, most women are pretty feeble, but I am a special woman.</p></blockquote>
<p>At a point where Thatcher’s chosen ideology is resulting in <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/the-womens-blog-with-jane-martinson/2011/oct/05/womens-dwindling-support-for-cameron">falling standards of living</a> for women &#8211; and men &#8211; across Britain; where the dim and insubstantial <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3252FSW7OC4">Louise Mensch</a> can manage to position herself as a rising star, and where the Home Secretary’s political decisions make fewer headlines than her choice of shoe, I’m relieved to see that attempts to rehabilitate Thatcher as any kind of feminist icon are largely <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-derbyshire-16438897">being </a><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/the-womens-blog-with-jane-martinson/2012/jan/05/margaret-thatcher-feminist-icon?INTCMP=SRCH">resisted</a>. It remains to be seen whether <strong>The Iron Lady</strong>, and its fallout in the form of frankly offensive Thatcher-inspired <a href="http://www.graziadaily.co.uk/fashion/archive/2011/08/11/holy-handbags-batgirl-its-georgia-may-thatcher.htm">fashion shoots</a>, means that her image is now undergoing a further transcendence into the realms of irony and kitsch (as has happened with both Marilyn and Che), or whether this is part of a conscious revival of the political associations her image originally carried and to which we are being returned – conditions profoundly unfriendly to female independence and agency despite the women occasionally employed as their shock troops.</p>
