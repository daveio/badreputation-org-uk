					<description><![CDATA[Now that I'm no longer a chippy thirteen-year-old convinced that people with trust-funds can't make good music, I've been reassessing Elastica.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/HHlypG2kJuc?rel=0" frameborder="0" width="420" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>This post was mostly inspired by the complaint of my fellow BadRep member Sarah J that, when the subject of Elastica comes up, the band are frequently dismissed outright as flagrant copyists led by Britpop&#8217;s version of Lady Macbeth. In fairness, I spent most of the 90s thinking the same thing. God, I used to hate Elastica. Wilfully amateur slack-jawed rip-off merchants whose over-privileged frontwoman seemed to exist only as a drawly amalgam of her indie boyfriends (hair by Brett, boots by Damon), whose competency in snagging the catchiest bits of post-punk couldn’t disguise how irritatingly thick and bland they were in all other respects. Right? Right. Now that I&#8217;m no longer a chippy thirteen-year-old convinced that people with trust-funds can&#8217;t make good music, I&#8217;ve been reassessing Elastica.</p>

Image via Wikipedia, shared under Fair Use guidelines." width="220" height="79" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Elastica are a band it&#8217;s probably easier to appreciate in retrospect and in isolation from their era, especially if you weren&#8217;t actually around for it. They weren&#8217;t a great fit with Britpop, their music drawing more on the punk revivalism of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_wave_of_new_wave">New Wave of New Wave</a>, one of several burgeoning movements which Britpop left steamrollered in its wake. This 70s-rooted recycling was also ahead of its time, being more of a piece with the early-2000s bands also inspired by post-punk: like Karen O, or Jack White, Justine Frischmann now just looks like a cool-as-fuck frontperson. I mean, she <em>was</em> posh, of course. If she called her dad, not only could he stop it all but in 1989 he could also buy her a Kensington townhouse. Not that she ever tried to hide this, or to claim any kind of gritty authenticity. (Given that the British music press, and music in general, was and remains riddled with posh girls and boys, I do wonder how much of the media focus on this aspect was some kind of overdefensive deflection on their part, back in the insulting and appropriative days of poor-is-cool.)</p>
<p>Elastica&#8217;s potted biography reads like a Britpop potboiler &#8211; or, in accounts like John Harris&#8217;, <a href="http://damonalbarnunofficial.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/indie-soap-opera-justine-frischmann.html">an &#8216;indie soap opera&#8217;</a>. Frischmann founded Suede with her fellow UCL student Brett Anderson in 1989, hawking the embryonic group around Camden as their <em>de facto</em> manager before leaving both Suede and Anderson for her iconic power-coupling with chancer <em>extraordinaire</em>, Blur&#8217;s Damon Albarn. In 1992 she formed her own group with former Suede drummer Justin Welch, adding enigmatic Brightonian bassist Annie Holland (who ended up with her own <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4m5WC63BfU">theme song</a>) and south Welsh urchin Donna Matthews as Frischmann&#8217;s musical foil on guitar. In 1993 they released <strong>Stutter</strong>, a crushingly cool eyeroll of a single that, having something to do with male sexual dysfunction and something to do with female sexual frustration, was one of the most playfully frank songs I’d heard since <strong>Orgasm Addict</strong>. The next year, as Britpop was decisively yanked into the mainstream, Frischmann’s relationship with Blur&#8217;s lead singer gained her lasting notoriety in the music press and beyond as a kind of Britpop <a href="http://venturefans.org/vbwiki/Dr._Girlfriend">Dr Girlfriend</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/0ie4x8hWYYE?rel=0" frameborder="0" width="420" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>I’ll come to the fuss made over Justine’s sex life later. The <em>other</em> Thing That Everyone Knows About Elastica is that they stole all their best riffs. Well, yes, Elastica settled out of court with both Wire (<strong>Line Up</strong>, a song I&#8217;m still happy to hate, rips off the chorus of Wire&#8217;s <strong>I Am the Fly</strong>; the synth in <strong>Connection</strong> rips off the guitar in <strong>Three Girl Rhumba</strong>) and the Stranglers (<strong>Waking Up</strong> rips off <strong>No More Heroes</strong> pretty much wholesale) &#8211; but let&#8217;s think about this. Britpop itself was incredibly derivative, backwards-looking, insular and self-referential, as were its exponents. The entire exercise was a cultural and aesthetic rip-off of the late 1960s, and more particularly of the Beatles-Kinks-Jam tradition of white-boy guitar rock. Musical, lyrical and sartorial rip-offs (or &#8216;tributes&#8217;, or &#8216;homages&#8217;, or &#8216;cheeky nods to&#8217;) abounded, as indeed they do in any period and genre. In music as in any art form, it&#8217;s what one does with it that counts. I still rate <strong>Cigarettes and Alcohol</strong>, for instance, despite its massive musical debt to T-Rex&#8217;s <strong>Get It On</strong>, and despite Oasis&#8217; massive debt in general to, oh, let&#8217;s start with the Beatles, Status Quo, Slade and the Glitter Band.</p>
<p>If it were simply a case of, to misquote an unknown wit, &#8216;Your album is both good and original. But the part that is good is not original, and the part that is original is not good&#8217;, that would be one thing. But there is a reason why 1995&#8217;s <strong>Elastica</strong> became the fastest-selling debut in UK history at the time. Even in the throes of my irritation with Frischmann herself, I found the music slickly derivative, sure, but also annoyingly listenable. The songs on the debut &#8211; which it took me about three years to grudgingly buy and listen to in full &#8211; are sharp, snarky and unadorned gems strung together by that snide, campy <em>Sprechgesang</em> that was probably Justine&#8217;s best musical asset. The songs range from little flash-bangs of sex-positive brilliance (<strong>Stutter</strong>, <strong>All-Nighter</strong>, <strong>Blue</strong>, <strong>Vaseline</strong>), to vaguely sinister languor (<strong>S.O.F.T</strong>, <strong>2:1</strong>, <strong>Waking Up</strong>), to the archly anthemic (<strong>Car Song</strong>, <strong>Line Up</strong>, <strong>Connection</strong>). The album’s stripped-down, angular art-punk, its odd, listless mix of sleaze and melancholy, and the band&#8217;s Last Gang In Town fronting in photographs and on record sleeves, anticipated the revival (or the ripping-off, perhaps?) of such stylings almost a decade later by the Strokes/Libertines axis of hipster. And when thinking back to the bands who came to be regarded as luminaries towards the tail-end of Britpop &#8211; The Bluetones, Shed 7, Northern Uproar, and no doubt I&#8217;ve repressed many more &#8211; you can only wish they&#8217;d ripped off something half as interesting themselves.</p>

<p>At a point in the 90s where the dominant female aesthetic revolved around ladette football shirts or twee tea-dresses, Elastica adopted an atypical New Wave uniform: black leather, drainpipe jeans, hair boyishly cropped or bobbed. For Frischmann at least, her androgynous aesthetic was a deliberate choice linked to self-consciousness, a protective effacing or subsuming of femininity which will make sense to anyone who&#8217;s tried to negotiate the disputed territory of being socially independent while aware of one&#8217;s relative vulnerability. In an interview with Simon Reynolds in 1995, Justine referred to her choice of look as &#8216;Nineties urban camouflage&#8217;, and, interestingly, associated the process of growing up with learning to step away from a conventionally feminine presentation rather than accepting it:</p>
<blockquote><p>[JF]&#8230;When you&#8217;re in your twenties you feel more confident about what you are, you don&#8217;t feel like you necessarily have to dress up for boys. When I was a teenager I had really long hair and felt like I had to wear make-up. But now I feel a lot more comfortable with short hair. It&#8217;s something I discovered with leaving home and going to college. In a way, it&#8217;s Nineties urban camoflage. It came about when I was coming back from college really late, getting on the last tube. If you&#8217;re wearing long hair and make-up, you&#8217;re gonna feel a lot more vulnerable than if you&#8217;ve got short hair and big boots&#8230;</p>
<p>[SR] So there&#8217;s a sense that you sartorially avoid the things that signify vulnerability or &#8216;availability&#8217;?</p>
<p>[JF] It&#8217;s just expecting to be treated as one of the lads. You don&#8217;t want to deliberately remove yourself from being able to be a good bloke.</p>
<p>&#8211; <a href="http://reynoldsretro.blogspot.co.uk/2007/09/elastica-interview-melody-maker-march.html">Source.</a></p></blockquote>
<p>NB I like Reynolds&#8217; idea, in this interview, of women artists in the 90s &#8216;taking on played-out male traditions, tweaking and reinventing them&#8217;, but I&#8217;m not altogether sure how helpful it is to dub it &#8216;stylistic transvestism&#8217; as he does, rather than simply problematising &#8216;feminine&#8217; identity itself. (He&#8217;s on steadier ground when he mentions Buzzcocks, who Elastica remind me of especially in songs like <strong>Stutter</strong> and <strong>All-Nighter</strong>, with Justine&#8217;s nonchalantly transgressive blurring of gender norms suggesting a southern female mirror-image of Pete Shelley, but maybe that&#8217;s just me.)</p>
<p>On &#8216;stylistic transvestism&#8217;, she seemed similarly doubtful:</p>
<blockquote><p>[SR] Drag kings rule: Polly Jean Harvey with her hoary blues-man posturings; Courtney Love as Henry Rollins if he&#8217;d only remove his &#8216;Iron Man&#8217; emotional armature and let his &#8216;feminine side&#8217; splurge&#8217;n&#8217;splatter; Liz Phair and her feminised/feminist take on the geeky garage punk of Paul Westerberg of the Replacements. And there&#8217;s Justine Frischmann, who&#8217;s somehow miraculously found imaginative space for herself in the Stranglers&#8217; gruff, fake-prole belligerence and &#8216;who wants the world?&#8217; cynicism. That said, Justine&#8217;s pretty phazed when I ask if she ever feels like she&#8217;s in drag onstage.</p>
<p>[JF] Well, I sometimes feel like Meatloaf, when I&#8217;ve got hair all over my face and I&#8217;m really sweaty. Which is a bit depressing. But no, I don&#8217;t ever feel like a woman in drag, to be honest.</p>
<p>[SR] So there&#8217;s no sense in which you play-act a tough-guy?</p>
<p>[JF] I think lots of women do that these days. And there&#8217;s always been girly girls and non-girly girls. There&#8217;s girls who have really high voices and like wearing dresses, and others who don&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m exceptional, it&#8217;s just that most of my mates haven&#8217;t been very girly. There&#8217;s lots of young women in London who look and dress like I do.</p>

<p>Even when I was forcing myself to dislike her on grounds of class chippiness, one of the things I couldn’t help liking about Justine was the casual confidence, the superiority even, in so much of her lyrics and delivery, and their emphasis on female sexual agency. <strong>All-Nighter</strong> is, like <strong>Stutter</strong>, a self-assured and playful song about sexual frustration, and there&#8217;s an archly objective approach to sex in <strong>Car Song</strong> and <strong>Vaseline</strong> and many more. There&#8217;s &#8216;just&#8217; sex in these songs &#8211; little sentiment and less romance &#8211; but equally there&#8217;s little angst, no judgement and no self-reproach. <strong>Never Here</strong> is a heartfelt, simple and incisive anatomy of a defunct relationship, just as well-crafted and moving as, say, Blur’s <strong>Tender</strong>, but terse and economic where the latter is overblown. Frischmann&#8217;s protagonists are thinly drawn but invariably assertive and self-possessed, frustrated or impatient with their hapless, thoughtless or less self-assured partners, sure of what they want and feeling no guilt about taking it. They never make a point of being Bad Girls, they just happen to be girls.</p>
<p>Like her fellow Stranglers aficionado <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/11/30/gaye-advert-and-the-great-cock-n-balls-swindle/">Gaye Advert</a> twenty years previously, Frischmann&#8217;s drop-dead charisma got in the way of her stated intention to be &#8216;one of the lads&#8217;. Her sexually confident persona and Elastica&#8217;s pleasure-centred, borderline-selfish lyrics, despite their matter-of-fact delivery, tended to be treated as &#8216;naughtily&#8217; deviant departures from feminine convention rather than just another way in which women might happen to view themselves and their sex lives. That the music press and wider media insistently framed Justine in relation to the men she chose to sleep with was part of a wider sexualisation where, in the post-Britpop 90s, female sexual agency had increasingly to be presented within a Lad frame of reference. I remember, specifically, there being a weird concentration by the music press on whether she would or wouldn&#8217;t pose for <strong>Playboy</strong>. It&#8217;s tempting to conclude that Frischmann&#8217;s ostensibly aloof and independent approach, her chilled assertiveness, her androgyny, and perhaps her background, attracted a reductive emphasis on her sexuality and sex life as a way of rendering her comprehensible, less of a threat and more of a &#8216;regular&#8217; girl.</p>
<p>Women weren&#8217;t absent from 90s indie, but <a href="http://upclosemaspersonal.blogspot.com/2012/03/lost-girls.html">as I&#8217;ve written elsewhere</a>, there is a sense in which they were squeezed to the margins by the elevation of &#8216;lad bands&#8217;, the testosterone-heavy dominance (with some honourable and dishonourable exceptions) of the music press and mens&#8217; magazines, and the focus on male key players and kingmakers, from Anderson, Albarn and the Gallaghers to Alan McGee. The received wisdom of Britpop as a male concern and male preserve obscures how highly-rated Elastica were at the time &#8211; notably, they came closer than either Oasis or Blur to cracking the lucrative US market &#8211; and it also overlooks the contribution made by Frischmann to Britpop&#8217;s originating impulse. Love or hate it, Frischmann&#8217;s influence on and creative partnerships with (or, if we&#8217;re going with the Lady Macbeth angle, her bewitching and manipulation of) Britpop&#8217;s main men was instrumental to the movement but goes more or less unsung. Instead she now gets frequently relegated to a minor player, an accessory or at best a &#8216;muse&#8217; to the more famous and credible men in her life, and her band are remembered as, in Sarah J&#8217;s words, a &#8216;Blurgirlfriend novelty act&#8217;. Her break-up with Albarn in 1997 was partly the result of a reluctance to accept what she perceived as the restrictions of domesticity and motherhood:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Damon was saying to me, &#8216;You&#8217;ve given me a run for my money, you&#8217;ve proved that you&#8217;re just as good as I am, you&#8217;ve had a hit in America &#8211; now settle down and let&#8217;s have kids.&#8217; He wanted me to stop being in a group, stop touring and have children. I wasn&#8217;t very happy, and he kept saying, &#8216;The reason you&#8217;re unhappy is because you really want children but you don&#8217;t know it.&#8217; It did throw me: I thought about it quite seriously.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="http://damonalbarnunofficial.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/indie-soap-opera-justine-frischmann.html">Source.</a></p></blockquote>

Image via wikipedia, shared under fair use guidelines." width="278" height="192" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>After 1996 Elastica were gradually subsumed by smack, angst and inter-band acrimony, with an endless parade of members leaving, being replaced and returning. Their second album, 2000&#8217;s <strong>The Menace</strong>, was more firmly anchored in post-punk experimentalism, but lacklustre, anticlimactic and accordingly less than commercial &#8211; although I had by this point got over myself enough to admit that I liked it, an epiphany which I&#8217;m sure was a source of extraordinary comfort for the band, who announced their amicable break-up the following year. Since then, Frischmann has been a bit of a Renaissance woman: collaborating with M.I.A. on songs including 2003&#8217;s <strong>Galang</strong>; moving to Colorado to study visual arts and psychology; dipping into abstract painting; and, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOlnQfTKoU4">as shown here</a>, fronting a BBC series on modern architecture.</p>
<p>Justine Frischmann&#8217;s rise against a Britpop backdrop, and her subsequent infamy or dismissal, raises several issues relevant to feminism: the denial or marginalizing of women&#8217;s contributions to artistic and creative moments; the relegation of women to the accessory of whichever man they happen to have slept with; the idea that women in bands are automatically amateur or derivative, or just not as good at being amateur and derivative as the boys are. However short-lived Elastica&#8217;s fame and drawn-out their dissipated demise, their career remains more edifying than watching the Oasis juggernaut run slowly and embarrassingly out of steam, or indeed whatever Alex James is currently up to.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A short while ago I made <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/02/15/put-your-red-shoes-on/">a short post</a> talking up the <a href="http://www.theredpumpproject.org/"><strong>Red Pump Project</strong></a>. I was really pleased that the lovely people at the Project actually saw my shoutout, and stopped by to say hello, hoping that in the run up to March 10, which is National Women &amp; Girls&#8217; HIV Awareness Day over in the USA, we&#8217;d share some photos of ourselves rocking red shoes as a gesture of solidarity.</p>
<p>This post is delivering on that request &#8211; I got several of our mixed gender team on board, so you can see some of our feet here rocking various shapes and styles of red shoe from the subtle to the spaceboot. (Yeah, those are mine. I have no taste and proudly revel in it.)</p>

I have much less know-how about HIV in the USA, so I&#8217;ve bolted on some UK-based rambling to go with my more general cheerleading.</p>
<h3>Shoes, Shoes, Shoes</h3>
<p>On the most basic symbolic level, shoes are about Going Places. Michele Roberts&#8217; short story <strong>Your Shoes</strong>, so beloved of GCSE anthologies nationwide, is about a missing girl who has flown the nest, leaving behind an unworn pair of shoes which seem to speak of unspent potential. Waiting For Godot &#8211; a play where no one goes anywhere &#8211; opens with a lonely visual of a worn-out pair of boots that no longer fit. Nancy Sinatra&#8217;s had enough; her boots are gonna walk all over you.</p>

So for me the visual of all our shoes on show is a good way to put the question: <em>where from here?</em> whilst also adding <em>god damn it, somewhere, though. Somewhere good. Somewhere better.</em>)</p>
<p>But I want this post to be more than just flag-waving &#8211; after all, since we are not in the US and cannot fully participate in the project at large, it surely doesn&#8217;t change much about HIV stigma for us to simply photograph our feet. The arresting visual of the shoes &#8211; and the Red Pump Project are <a href="http://www.theredpumpproject.org/rock-the-red-fashion-show/">running a full fashion show</a> at the end of the month &#8211; is a starting point or conduit, like wearing the <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/12/01/markgrafs-world-aids-day-rampage/">World AIDS Day red ribbon</a>, to having a conversation. So I&#8217;m gonna put a lot of UK links in here too.</p>
<h3>Across the Pond</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/shoes.jpg?resize=272%2C314" alt="" width="272" height="314" data-recalc-dims="1" />In that post I made I talked about the importance of awareness/prevention campaigns not using a kind of shock tactic to alienate and stigmatise people living with HIV. Without going too deeply into UK/USA healthcare provision comparisons, initiatives like the RPP (excepting the <a href="http://www.nat.org.uk">NAT</a>-spearheaded fundraising drives pre-World AIDS Day) don&#8217;t feel so common over here. Perhaps because we assume the NHS will carry our HIV testing and awareness needs, but also because services who do take a non-discriminatory approach, like <a href="http://www.positiveeast.org.uk/">Positive East</a> and the Terrence Higgins Trust are very much up against Tory cuts just now. Unfortunately, this dovetails with the fact that the NHS is facing &#8220;reforms&#8221; that threaten to stitch it up like a free market kipper, so in drumming up awareness for the RPP I guess I&#8217;d also like to talk briefly about the importance of trying, in the UK, to both appreciate the gravity of our own situation, and the commonalities between the areas the RPP is concentrating on &#8211; urban districts where people just aren&#8217;t talking or thinking openly or inclusively about HIV &#8211; and UK equivalents. HIV affects so many people that a lot of UK feminists simply don&#8217;t see it as a specific enough issue, but the thing is, it often interacts with more commonly accepted feminist issues such as contraception, sexual assault, and so on in complex and &#8211; as far as the feminist blogosphere is concerned &#8211; markedly under-analysed ways.</p>
<p>HIV transmission rates, access to support services, and the level of stigma faced by people living with it, all intersect with, and are influenced by, cuts to <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmpublic/legalaid/memo/la19.htm">advocacy</a>, <a href="http://www.myhiv.org.uk/Your-rights/Benefits/Benefit-cuts">disability benefits</a>, education and healthcare services. And when the latter are in play to the level they currently are in Britain, they mean that existing social inequalities get very heavily underscored. Stigma around living with HIV then gets worse, and this underscores inequalities even further, and you get a snake-chew-tail plughole situation. Stigma is very often doled out in inherently gendered terms, with a load of harmful assumptions about what kind of woman or man would be likely to contract or transmit the virus, so not engaging with it feeds more general problems of racism, homophobia and gendered prejudice. As far as I&#8217;m concerned this makes it very much a feminist issue in the same way that issues of poverty, class and <a href="http://www.naz.org.uk/">race</a> are, and indeed these areas are all affected by HIV in complex ways which keep people in disadvantaged groups one step removed from the care they need, and have a right to access.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/photo1.jpg?resize=285%2C370" alt="" width="285" height="370" data-recalc-dims="1" />In the UK at least, I don&#8217;t think enough women, feminists or otherwise, are receiving the information and discussion they need and deserve on this issue, so I&#8217;ll always come out loudly shouting for a project like the RPP which encourages a discussion which takes into account the intersections of gender, race and class and their impact on HIV issues.</p>
<h3>&#8216;Girlhood in the time of AIDS&#8217;</h3>
<p>For an illustration of how a lot of &#8216;western&#8217; mainstream &#8220;girl culture&#8221; &#8211; like teen magazines &#8211; has historically displayed an unfortunately privilege-waving &#8220;us and them&#8221; attitude to the prevalence of HIV, along with some harmfully obtuse ideas about who contracts it, where, why and how, I would recommend the essay <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=arQy0v_PBx4C&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=%22girlhood+in+the+time+of+aids%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EaZWT4baCMHb8gO74KTzCA&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22girlhood%20in%20the%20time%20of%20aids%22&amp;f=false"><strong>Girlhood in the time of AIDS</strong></a> by Nancy Lesko and Elisabeth Johnson, from the book <strong>Girl Culture</strong>. Reading it &#8211; it&#8217;s pretty US-focussed &#8211; just makes me that much more relieved there are initiatives like the RPP going strong.</p>
<p>As founder Karyn put it in her comment on that earlier post:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the main goals of our nonprofit and the campaign is to promote open dialogue, to fight the stigma around the disease, and to share knowledge around the issues so that women are EMPOWERED to advocate for their health and the health of the women in their lives.</p></blockquote>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t agree more.<br />
<img loading="lazy" class="alignright" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/shoes2.jpg?resize=245%2C328" alt="" width="245" height="328" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h3>Back on the UK Front&#8230;</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s important to recognise the power of grassroots projects like this whilst also refuting David Cameron&#8217;s position that community-based initiatives are a &#8220;Big Society alternative&#8221; or in any way an oppositional model to a free national health service. Some NHS Trusts in the UK work in partnership with community-specific schemes such as, for example, the Terrence Higgins Lighthouse projects &#8211; a fact <a href="http://www.raconteuronthetimes.co.uk/combatting-hiv/ghana-peckham/">this article</a>, for example, which contains a great example of a grassroots HIV activism project, fails in my view to take account of. There are lighthouses and there are ports. Having both is generally not a bad idea.  I would not be optimistic about the storm of social inequalities facing either in the event this bill passes uncontested.</p>
<p>Tonight the TUC are declaring <a href="http://www.tuc.org.uk/industrial/tuc-20597-f0.cfm">a rally at Westminster</a> to make this point again. In the week a doctor was caught on film <a href="http://www.theweek.co.uk/politics/45721/lansley-chased-through-hospital-corridor-doctor">openly challenging</a> Lansley&#8217;s bloody-minded assault on our services in the hospital in which he works, in the week <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2012/feb/25/june-hautot-lansley-protest">June Hautot cried &#8220;Codswallop!&#8221;</a>, and as an NHS employee myself, I would invite anyone who is in the area to swing by and raise your voice.</p>
<p>Boots, after all, were made for walking.<br />
