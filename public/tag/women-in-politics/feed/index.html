					<description><![CDATA[I wanted to write not about Thatcher, but about representations of her.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I can&#8217;t write a political or historical retrospective on Thatcher, on her life or her works. If I did, it might come out like <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/apr/09/russell-brand-margaret-thatcher?INTCMP=SRCH" target="_blank">the Russell Brand piece</a>, only a bit more Northern, a bit more reflective on her impact on feminism.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve read and seen far too much already over the past few days, from endless eulogies in the papers through to angry words on the street and in the House of Commons. The truth is I am genuinely shaken by it. Like the Queen Mother, she was one of those figures we all suspected might go on forever, and her shadow was long. With it gone, one of the touchpoints for my personal politics is gone.</p>
<p>I started to think about how I might even begin to parse what has happened: I&#8217;m not sad, but I&#8217;ll admit I didn&#8217;t crack open the champagne personally; I merely drank someone else&#8217;s.So in a similar vein, I wanted to write not about her, but about representations of her.</p>
<h2>Maggie&#8217;s Farm</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/maggiesfarmcover.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="13514" data-permalink="/2013/04/15/images-of-an-iron-lady/maggiesfarmcover/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/maggiesfarmcover.jpg?fit=250%2C176&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="250,176" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="maggiesfarmcover" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/maggiesfarmcover.jpg?fit=250%2C176&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/maggiesfarmcover.jpg?fit=250%2C176&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-13514 aligncenter" alt="Cover for Steve Bell's Maggie's Farm" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/maggiesfarmcover.jpg?resize=250%2C176" width="250" height="176" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to start with one of my favourite political cartoonists. Alongside his later portrayal of her puppeteering Tony Blair, comic artist <a href="http://www.belltoons.co.uk/books" target="_blank">Steve Bell</a> also focuses on her controlling authority. He wrote a series called <strong>Maggie&#8217;s Farm</strong> which depicted her as completely insane &#8211; with trademark wonky eye and multiple exclamation points in her speech.</p>
<p>The comics, which reference Dylan&#8217;s song of the same title (which was in itself used as a protest song against Thatcher) were originally published in <strong>Time Out</strong> from 1979, and, to my eye, probably heavily influenced later depictions.</p>
<h2>Spitting Image</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Magaret-Thatcher.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="13515" data-permalink="/2013/04/15/images-of-an-iron-lady/magaret-thatcher/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Magaret-Thatcher.jpg?fit=462%2C353&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="462,353" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Magaret Thatcher" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Magaret-Thatcher.jpg?fit=300%2C229&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Magaret-Thatcher.jpg?fit=462%2C353&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-13515 aligncenter" alt="Spitting Image's version of Thatcher" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Magaret-Thatcher.jpg?resize=370%2C282" width="370" height="282" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>The first time I saw <strong>Spitting Image</strong> I was hooked, probably helped by the fact my parents told me I wasn&#8217;t allowed to watch it, and to this day I regret that it has gone off the air. Perhaps it&#8217;s because no satire is strong enough to be distinguished from the ridiculous facts of today&#8217;s government? Anyway, back to Thatcher.</p>
<p>The depiction of her was grotesque, but no more so than that of any other puppet on the show. That said, it was the <em>nature</em> of the grotesque that interested me.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/jINZBOxdja8" height="360" width="480" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>She was ridiculed for her strength and controlling nature in the form of a horrific headmistress. It&#8217;s interesting to note that later John Major was ridiculed for his <em>lack</em> of strength.</p>
<p>But rather than this being portrayed as an essential part of her it was represented in reference to Thatcher as a woman  (note the ongoing references to her as &#8220;sir&#8221;). Her strength was ridiculed, in part, by presenting it as &#8220;unfeminine&#8221; and therefore funny or dangerous: a stereotype of women in politics that will no doubt take many years to overturn. <a href="http://spittingimage.wikia.com/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher" target="_blank">As the series moved on she became less and less human</a>, eventually turning into an alien monster.</p>

<h2>The Old Iron Woman</h2>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/raymondbriggs-old-iron-woman.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="13520" data-permalink="/2013/04/15/images-of-an-iron-lady/picture-4293/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/raymondbriggs-old-iron-woman.jpg?fit=400%2C291&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="400,291" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;IWM Gordon McLeod&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Ixpress 96 - Hasselblad Winder CW&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1176371744&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;IWM&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;50&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.125&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Picture 4293&quot;}" data-image-title="Picture 4293" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/raymondbriggs-old-iron-woman.jpg?fit=300%2C218&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/raymondbriggs-old-iron-woman.jpg?fit=400%2C291&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13520" alt="The Old Iron Woman" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/raymondbriggs-old-iron-woman.jpg?resize=400%2C291" width="400" height="291" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Raymond Briggs delivers a rendition of the Falklands War in a way that is moving, vitriolic, frightening and humbling in his 1984 piece <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tin-Pot_Foreign_General_and_the_Old_Iron_Woman" target="_blank"><strong>The Tin Pot Foreign General and The Old Iron Woman</strong></a>.</p>
<p>What I find particularly interesting here is how her depiction contrasts with that of <strong>Spitting Image</strong>. Both use the &#8220;non-human&#8221; references, but whereas the <strong>Spitting Image</strong> Thatcher is usually either asexual or very masculine, here she is quite the opposite. Guns and victory explosions fire from her breasts as she squats (in high heels, with rounded buttocks and suspenders, no less) over her land and nation in a parody of birth. The conflation of female and war-machine gives rise to a gross, highly sexualised fembot.</p>

<p>I returned from holiday just over a year ago to find London distressingly covered in images of Meryl Streep in <strong>The Iron Lady</strong>, with her icy blue eyes following me all over the place. It haunted me, <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/01/10/on-thatcher-icons-and-iron-ladies-rhian-jones/">in much the same way as it did our Rhian Jones</a> (I&#8217;ll admit it, I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to see the film).</p>
<p>It was the glossiness of the whole thing that threw me, the vogue-ish fashion magazine stylings that worked their hardest to reunite those twin features of &#8220;female&#8221; and &#8220;powerful&#8221; which had created such horrors through both <strong>Spitting Image</strong> and at the pencil of Raymond Briggs. And they succeeded in being very flattering, through a combination of make-up and airbrushing.</p>
<p>Streep is noticeably less wrinkled and more attractively-styled than Thatcher, looking eerily like a better-looking sister. The situation was enhanced by Streep&#8217;s own acting ability, and a script which included scenes of feminine domesticity.</p>
<h2>What next?</h2>
<p>I never knew her. Never met her. I only understood her as a series of images and icons, on the television as a politician and in other representations of her, which are more numerous than I can contain in one article. Buzzfeed, for example, <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/angelameiquan/21-incredibly-angry-songs-about-margaret-thatcher">collected a list of songs about her</a>. Like many other dead, famous people, over time she will fade from a real person, who nonetheless was one of the bogeymen of my childhood (alongside the boggle-faced baddie animals in <a href="http://www.80snostalgia.com/orm-and-cheep/"><strong>Orm and Cheep</strong></a>) to being almost imaginary, an icon.</p>
<p>To me, she will always be the figurehead for all that is wrong with right wing thinking and the sort of &#8220;feminism&#8221; that claims it must be feminist if a woman is doing it. Those with opposing politics have put her on a pedestal. Other people will make her into other things.</p>
<p>I doubt we&#8217;ve seen the last representation, but I&#8217;ll be interested which version of Margaret Thatcher will stand the test of time, and which version we will be faced with next.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A spectre is haunting London. My daily commute, never a joyful affair, has recently been granted a further dimension of irritation by adverts on buses bearing the image of Meryl Streep dolled up as Mrs Thatcher.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A spectre is haunting London. My daily commute, never a joyful affair, has recently been lent a further dimension of irritation by adverts on buses, hoving into view with tedious regularity, bearing the image of <strong>Meryl Streep</strong> dolled up as Mrs Thatcher in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1007029/"><strong>The Iron Lady</strong></a>. Thirty years on from Thatcher&#8217;s rise to power, and after a minor rash of small-screen depictions – Andrea Riseborough in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1067578/"><strong>The Long Walk to Finchley</strong></a>, Lindsay Duncan in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1230150/"><strong>Margaret</strong></a> &#8211; Streep will now portray her on the big screen, the prospect of which I could have happily lived without.</p>
<p>Having as I do <a href="http://velvetcoalmine.wordpress.com/2011/09/19/the-pits-and-the-pendulum/">firsthand experience</a> of the impact of Thatcher’s thirteen years, her government’s break with prevailing consensus and bloody-minded devotion to neoliberal orthodoxies, an objective and rational evaluation of the woman is probably beyond me. That said, her presumably impending death &#8211; although I do have a longstanding appointment at a pub in King&#8217;s Cross to dutifully raise a glass &#8211; is something to which I&#8217;ll be largely indifferent. It won&#8217;t matter. Thatcher as a person has far less bearing on the current world than what she represents. The damage has been done, the battle lost, and much as I might appreciate a Truth and Reconciliation Commission into the 1980s, Thatcher and her co-conspirators are by now <a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/steven-baxter/2011/12/decisions-away-information">too old and whiskey-soaked</a> to be held to any meaningful account.</p>
<p>Efforts to humanise Thatcher, even when they enlist Meryl Streep, seem discomfiting and deeply bizarre. What she means has transcended what she was, is and will be. The purpose of this post, therefore, apart from being an exercise in detachment for me, is to look briefly at some aspects of Thatcher’s image in political and pop culture, and to consider the effect of her gender on her role as a woman in power. Quick, before the next bus goes past.</p>
<h3>The Icon Lady</h3>
<blockquote><p>Meanings of all kinds flow through the figures of women, and they often do not include who she herself is.</p>
<p>&#8211; Marina Warner, <strong>Monuments and Maidens</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Thatcher’s visual staying power in political and pop culture is as great as her impact on <a href="http://johnrobb77.wordpress.com/2009/06/16/how-margaret-thatcher-changed-pop-culture-for-ever/">oppositional music</a>. The face of Thatcher most often called to mind is that of what Angela Carter termed her ‘balefully iconic’ post-1983 premiership: encased in true-blue power suits, wielding a handbag, her hair lacquered into immobile submission, her earlier style solidified into a heavily stylized femininity bordering on drag. Paul Flynn, in a <a href="http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/paul_flynn/2006/05/by_paul_flynn.html">fairly tortured discussion</a> of Thatcher’s status as a gay icon, put it down to her ‘ability to carry a strong, identifiable, signature look&#8230; an intrinsic and steely power to self-transform’, and a ‘camp, easily cartooned presence’. The startling evocative power of this look, its ability to summon up its host of contemporary social, cultural and political associations, is why I jump when Streep&#8217;s replication of it intrudes into my vision. It’s like being repeatedly sideswiped by the 1980s, which is something the last UK election had already made me thoroughly sick of.</p>

The artist Alison Jackson <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/feb/11/margaret-thatcher-meryl-streep-photograph">observes</a> that all three &#8216;had what it takes to become a modern icon: big hair, high foreheads and a face that would allow you to project your own fears and desires on to it.&#8217; Conversely, subsequent political leaders &#8211; including both <a href="http://cvcl.mit.edu/hybrid_gallery/tatcher_blair.html">Blair</a> and <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_OVzuV6XUReA/TJ0EjTQ29WI/AAAAAAAAARU/SOy8bXxatls/s1600/Cameron-Thatcher.png">Cameron</a> &#8211; have had their own faces conflated with Thatcher’s, usually as part of left-wing critiques meant to signify the closeness of their policies to hers. Thatcher’s image is here used as an instantly recognisable political signifier, communicating a set of ideological ideas in a single package, as well as a self-contained political warning sign.</p>
<p>Although the kind of passive objectification associated with Monroe might seem at odds with the idea of Thatcher as a great historical actor with narrative agency in her own right, the images of both women are used in a cultural tradition in which the female figure in particular becomes a canvas for the expression of abstract ideas (think justice, liberty, victory). The abstract embodiment of multiple meanings, and the strategic performance of traditional ideas of femininity, constitute sources of power which Thatcher and her political and media allies exploited to the hilt in their harnessing of support for the policies she promoted.</p>
<h3>Iron Maidens</h3>
<p>Thatcher’s image, rather than appealing solely to a particular aspect of femininity, was a tense mixture of conflicting and mutually reinforcing signifiers. Angela Carter <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/46831407/Angela-Carter-Shaking-a-Leg">identified</a> it as a composite of feminine archetypes, including <strong>Dynasty</strong>’s Alexis Carrington, Elizabeth I as Gloriana, Countess Dracula, and one of PG Wodehouse’s aunts – tropes sharing a certain type of burlesqued and grotesque dragon-femininity. The 1981 Falklands conflict allowed the discourse around Thatcher to reference the precedents of both Queen Victoria and Churchill, and she was photographed on a tank in an <a href="http://iconicphotos.wordpress.com/2009/04/23/thatcher-in-a-tank/">image</a> that the <strong>Daily Telegraph</strong> described as ‘a cross between Isadora Duncan and Lawrence of Arabia’.</p>
<p>Justine Picardie, in a <a href="http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/article/TMG8940986/The-Making-of-The-Iron-Ladys-Wardrobe.html">grimly fascinating read</a>, roots Thatcher’s style in the rigid grooming of well-turned-out 1950s femininity in general and her sartorially plain Methodist upbringing in particular:</p>
<blockquote><p>Interviewed by Dr Miriam Stoppard for Yorkshire Television in 1985, she gave a glimpse of a childhood desire for the luxury of colour, and shop-bought extravagance, whether a new dress or sofa cover: &#8216;that was a great expenditure and a great event. So you went out to choose them, and you chose something that looked really rather lovely, something light with flowers on it. My mother: &#8220;That&#8217;s not serviceable.&#8221; And how I longed for the time when I could buy things that were not serviceable.&#8217;</p></blockquote>
<p>Even at the height of her political power, she chose to retain the ‘pretty’ and ‘softening’ effects of her trademark <a href="http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/galleries/TMG8946898/Margaret-Thatchers-style-over-the-years.html">horrible bows</a>. Alongside this tendency towards aspirational frivolity, she cultivated connotations of the provincial housewife – a ‘Housewife Superstar’ – wearing an apron while on the campaign trail and being shown washing dishes while contesting the party leadership. </p>
<p>Her ‘Iron Lady’ speech distinctly echoed the ‘body of a weak and feeble woman&#8230; heart and stomach of a king’ construction <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_to_the_Troops_at_Tilbury">associated with Elizabeth I</a> in its drawing on the tension between conflicting signifiers:</p>
<blockquote><p>I stand before you tonight in my Red Star chiffon evening gown, my face softly made up and my fair hair gently waved, the Iron Lady of the Western World. A cold war warrior, an Amazon philistine, even a Peking plotter. Well, am I any of those things? Yes&#8230; Yes, I am an iron lady, after all it wasn&#8217;t a bad thing to be an iron duke.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Not a Man to Match Her?</h3>
<p>Thatcher&#8217;s courting of various feminine roles did not prevent the assigning of masculine attributes to her – notably in oppositional parodies and satire. Her iconic <strong>Spitting Image</strong> puppet was shown wearing a suit and tie and smoking a cigar, addressed as &#8216;Sir&#8217;, and given a more or less explicit emasculating effect upon male colleagues and political opponents:</p>
<p><iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/OyU8qmzGsEg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Outside satire, the 1984 Miners&#8217; Strike has been conceptualised both as a <a href="http://deathatthemall.wordpress.com/2011/12/16/men-at-war-mark-simpson-examines-masculinity-and-the-miners-strike/">mass emasculation</a> of ordinary male miners <em>and</em> an overt bout of cock-duelling between Thatcher and miners&#8217; leader Arthur Scargill, each of whom were criticised for an absolutist and stubbornly Napoleonic approach to the conflict rather than a more ‘feminine’ openness to negotiation and compromise.</p>
<p>As Dawn Fowler <a href="http://eprints.uwe.ac.uk/7817/">notes</a> in her consideration of dramatic treatments of the Falklands War, a problem with such portrayals of Thatcher is that she &#8216;can be represented as simply denying her true feminine self in favour of a crazed fascist agenda.&#8217; <strong>The Comic Strip</strong>’s <a href="http://gaffa.org/dreaming/glc.html">satirical take</a> on Thatcher’s battles with Ken Livingstone and the Greater London Council presented her as the victim of alien or demonic possession, the ending of which left her soft and passive – restored to her presumably appropriate, natural form. Both applauding Thatcher for her ability to overcome &#8216;traditional&#8217; feminine weakness and irrationality and behave symbolically as a man, and castigating her for her failure or suppression of a &#8216;true&#8217; soft and accommodating female nature, are equally dubious in the qualities they seek to assign to &#8216;real&#8217; women.</p>
<blockquote><p>Thatcher was repeatedly likened to a female impersonator, a man in blue dresses. The reason for this is simple, and apparently shatterproof: we have so firmly linked power and masculinity that we think a powerful woman is a category error. Instead of changing our ideas about power, we change the sex of a powerful woman. </p>
<p>&#8211; <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2011/dec/09/marilyn-monroe-margaret-thatcher-biopics"><strong>Sarah Churchwell</strong></a></p></blockquote>
<h3>No Job for a Lady?</h3>
<p>While Thatcher’s election to Prime Minister was of course a landmark for women in politics, her much-vaunted &#8216;grocer&#8217;s daughter&#8217; outsider status was mediated through an Oxford education and marriage into wealth. The number of prominent women serving as MPs and Cabinet ministers prior to or alongside Thatcher &#8211; Nancy Astor, Margaret Bondfield, Betty Harvie Anderson, Jenny Lee, Barbara Castle to name a few – make her ascension exceptional but not unique. Nor should Thatcher’s progress in the male-dominated world of British politics obscure how little she actually did for women once in office: the lack of women appointed to ministerial positions; her disparaging of ‘strident Women’s Libbers’; her invariably male ideological protégés. Historian Helen Castor, <a href="http://thebrowser.com/interviews/helen-castor-on-queens-and-power?page=3">discussing</a> the ‘extraordinary’ parallels between the iconography of Thatcher and that of Elizabeth I, points out that both women emphasised themselves as the exception to a rule:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;what those two women both did was not say, Women can rule, women can hold power. They both said, Yes, OK, most women are pretty feeble, but I am a special woman.</p></blockquote>
<p>At a point where Thatcher’s chosen ideology is resulting in <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/the-womens-blog-with-jane-martinson/2011/oct/05/womens-dwindling-support-for-cameron">falling standards of living</a> for women &#8211; and men &#8211; across Britain; where the dim and insubstantial <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3252FSW7OC4">Louise Mensch</a> can manage to position herself as a rising star, and where the Home Secretary’s political decisions make fewer headlines than her choice of shoe, I’m relieved to see that attempts to rehabilitate Thatcher as any kind of feminist icon are largely <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-derbyshire-16438897">being </a><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/the-womens-blog-with-jane-martinson/2012/jan/05/margaret-thatcher-feminist-icon?INTCMP=SRCH">resisted</a>. It remains to be seen whether <strong>The Iron Lady</strong>, and its fallout in the form of frankly offensive Thatcher-inspired <a href="http://www.graziadaily.co.uk/fashion/archive/2011/08/11/holy-handbags-batgirl-its-georgia-may-thatcher.htm">fashion shoots</a>, means that her image is now undergoing a further transcendence into the realms of irony and kitsch (as has happened with both Marilyn and Che), or whether this is part of a conscious revival of the political associations her image originally carried and to which we are being returned – conditions profoundly unfriendly to female independence and agency despite the women occasionally employed as their shock troops.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I <A href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/11/11/madam-president-about-time/" />wrote previously for BadRep</a> on how I&#8217;m disappointed by most female politicians who have held the top UK posts: while some of the less senior MPs have been great, titles such as &#8220;Home Secretary&#8221; seem to magically transform people overnight. It&#8217;s like Downing Street has a cellar with a Mad Scientist in it, and his lightning machine is nearly ready. You keep expecting David Cameron to turn up to work with a brain in a jar of green liquid, and announce that it&#8217;s the new Minister for Equality. We&#8217;re hoping for a female politician who will lift the image of women in power, and instead we get Nadine Dorries explaining how they called her mad, those fools at the Academy, but she&#8217;ll show them &#8211; she&#8217;ll show them all, or Louise Mensch saying we should shut down twitter and facebook during any riots.</p>
<p>In fact, responding to the recent London riots, current Home Secretary Theresa May said</p>
<blockquote><p>We must never forget that the only cause of a crime is a criminal.</p></blockquote>
<p>Given that she&#8217;s in charge of our systems to punish people and deter them from crime, she really ought to have a knowledge of the obvious pressures which <em>make</em> people commit it. In other words, that quote is the opposite of her job, and kinda shows she&#8217;s unfit for the post. (Also: it&#8217;s grammatically rubbish. A cause acts on a person; it can be anything except the person. Pick one! Just not the person.) Either way it&#8217;s not doing great things for the image of women in politics.</p>
<p>There are more women in governments globally than ever before, but whether politically left or right very few of them are behaving any differently to the men. That&#8217;s often understandable, since women at the very top are usually under double the scrutiny for any appearance of being &#8220;weak&#8221; or unsuitable.</p>

She is certainly overseeing a country that is doing things <em>very</em> differently, and in terms of democracy also Doing It Very Right. When you see the massive extent of what&#8217;s actually going on, you&#8217;ll be amazed (bear with me, there&#8217;s some politics coming up but pretty soon we get to the flying-shark-pirate-feminist adventures! I&#8217;m not kidding, this is epic.)</p>
<p>The World works a certain way when countries get into debt. The International Monetary Fund turns up, tells them to privatise everything and allow foreign investors to buy it all cheap, and refuses to give out any money for loans if they don&#8217;t. (I&#8217;m simplifying here, but&#8230; wait, no I&#8217;m not.) Everyone who is still rich agrees that this is the way to go. If you try something different, you will suffer the wrath of many governments, banks and newspapers.</p>
<p>Iceland said no. In fact, <A href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/08/01/1001662/-Icelands-On-going-Revolution">as this excellent article points out</a>, they had a revolution and threw out their government, which is pretty much the gold standard for saying no.</p>
<p>Weeks of protests and riots forced them to hold elections, and the new Government decided not to put the entire population into debt for decades by bailing out the banks. They held a referendum and 93% of the people thought they&#8217;d rather have Interpol arrest the bankers responsible instead, please. Oh, and they&#8217;re having a new Constitution, written by the public.</p>
<blockquote><p>To write the new constitution, the people of Iceland elected twenty-five citizens from among 522 adults not belonging to any political party but recommended by at least thirty citizens. This document was not the work of a handful of politicians, but was written on the internet. The constituents&#8217; meetings are streamed on-line, and citizens can send their comments and suggestions, witnessing the document as it takes shape.</p></blockquote>
<p>Did you know any of this? Did you know there&#8217;s a country in Europe who threw out their government through the power of protest, elected a left-wing coalition who then <em>asked the public what they wanted</em>, started writing new rules with complete visibility to anyone on the net, and stood up to the banks and IMF? Because I didn&#8217;t see the headlines.</p>
<p>As well as being the first openly-gay head of Government in recent times (and one of the first people in Iceland to fully marry her same-sex partner instead of a civil union), Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir is presiding as Prime Minister over one of the gutsiest, brass-badass, openly-defiant movements in the world. A <em>referendum</em>? Putting decisions in the hands of the <em>public?</em> None of that is ever allowed on choices which actually matter. As a friend of mine put it when she read the article: &#8220;Iceland, you <em>rockstar</em> &#8220;.</p>
<p>Feminists keep waiting for a woman in power to act in a way which differentiates her from the men. Other than being physically seen in the front row (which DOES make a difference), there&#8217;s not a lot of point getting a woman in office if she&#8217;s then invisible among the grey old guys. I&#8217;m not saying that women will govern differently just because they&#8217;re women (what? With feelings, while wearing pink? What exactly is supposed to be automatically different?) but Iceland&#8217;s Prime Minister is restoring democracy by definition &#8211; she&#8217;s giving the votes back to the people. Her government is one of the very few even considering going up against the demands of the US, UK, Europe, Asia&#8230; everybody. Whether she&#8217;s left- or right-wing doesn&#8217;t decide if she&#8217;s politically great, it&#8217;s listening to the views of her country and standing fast against furious demands from Big Money that makes her really quite awesome. </p>
<p>At the moment she is at the front of a government which is trying the first truly different moves in years, and finally we can see a female politician who will be famous for being liberal, fair, in touch with the public and <em>a titanium-plated Badass</em> in the face of pressure. By getting the people to write the new Constitution, she is directly giving a voice to the women of her country. Equal voting rights is crucial, but if that vote only affected things once every four years, and none of the parties offered what 93% of the population want, then the actual power of it would be somewhat lessened. Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir&#8217;s government is handing votes back to ordinary women and men and that&#8217;s amazing. The views of the whole population will be represented, with public debates via internet along the way.</p>
<p>Is increased democracy feminist? Do the majority of the public hold prejudices, and will their opinions harm women? Or by including more women, do you ensure they won&#8217;t vote against their own interests? Is it at least better than a rich, white, male elite doing all the decision-making?</p>
<p>In this case I&#8217;m not saying that Iceland&#8217;s policies being lefty is for the best, or that their referendum result is the correct one. After all, it might involve the UK not getting all its money back (although <A href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/apr/13/icesave-referendum-uk-payments">an article she wrote in April</a> suggests we&#8217;ll see at least 90%). Whether the decisions are good or bad, there is a powerful, articulate woman right at the top of an incredibly exciting political force right now. </p>
<p>I&#8217;d just like to ask if we can have Prime Minister Sigurðardóttir over here on an exchange program for a bit please? We&#8217;ll lend Iceland Theresa May in return, it&#8217;ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>STOP PRESS: EDIT!<br />
</strong><br />
Since the article which brought this to our attention did the rounds online, it&#8217;s <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/08/24/1010295/-Naomi-Klein-buys-into-the-Iceland-Revolution-mythos. ">become clear</a> that several key parts in it aren&#8217;t totally&#8230; well&#8230; accurate. At all.</p>
<p>Some of it is small in terms of the story: Iceland isn&#8217;t a member of the EU yet, it&#8217;s applying to join. And it didn&#8217;t go completely bankrupt, merely under lots and lots of debt.</p>
<p>The part about the new constitution being visible and people being able to send comments in as it goes &#8211; that one&#8217;s real, and that&#8217;s a major factor for us being excited. And regardless of whether Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir was instrumental in bringing any of these changes about, or was initially for or against them, our point is that she&#8217;s being seen by the world as the PM at the head of a government which is taking huge steps. If she wasn&#8217;t in favour of all the changes, she still retains double BadAss points for defending them so stongly as the official policy now.</p>
<p>Many thanks to commenter <strong>latentexistence</strong> and others who have helped point out where the inaccuracies lie: we stand by our cheering of the Prime Minister, but warn our readers to take the linked article with a metric ton of salt.</p>
