										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An FF from our Canadian cousins across the pond. Now, for reasons that escape me, I&#8217;ve long considered Canada to be a bastion of forward thinking and at the forefront of feminist thinking.</p>
<p>So it saddened me a little to find out that victim blaming is as rife on that side of the Atlantic as over here. Fortunately, there&#8217;s also a healthy culture  of individuality and protest. Thus arose today&#8217;s Found Feminism: <a href="http://www.slutwalktoronto.com/">Toronto&#8217;s SlutWalk</a>.</p>
<p>Have a look at the clip below which explains everything (well, not <em>everything</em> everything; the creation of the universe or where the other sock went is not covered):</p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="425" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/3vOCnZOcr8w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>I love inversions and subversions alike, which is why this linguistic reclamation project is placing &#8220;slut&#8221; alongside the word &#8220;queer&#8221; in my heart. Our very own wordsmith <strong>Hodge</strong> is probably <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/category/alphabet/">better placed</a> to go into the history of the word, although my wiki-fu tells me that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slut#Etymology"><strong>Chaucer</strong> used it to apply to lazy men</a> before it became an insult for sexually promiscuous women.</p>
<p>Now whilst I am the first person to get all mumsy and worry over scantily clad people gadding about, I will fight to defend their right to do so without being blamed if they are harrassed or assaulted. Because that is absurd and I&#8217;m not going to go into it here &#8211; let&#8217;s focus on the positive.</p>
<p>And the positive action.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a UK-based sister group planning a SlutWalk in Birmingham (Facebook page is<a href="https://www.facebook.com/slutwalkuk"> here</a>) so sign up, click &#8220;like&#8221; or even get your boob tube out and go for a walk in Brum. I may well see you there!</p>

<li><strong>Hollaback NYC</strong> have posted a video of a woman calling out a man who flashed her and rubbed up against her on the NYC subway. <a href="http://www.ihollaback.org/2010/11/i-see-his-penis-out/">I see his penis out!</a> <strong>CBS New York </strong>reports that he was <a href="http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2010/11/23/tables-turned-on-alleged-nyc-subway-flasher/">brought to justice </a>due to her actions.</li>
<li>
After the flasher was caught, <strong>Jezebel</strong> reported on <a href="http://jezebel.com/5696551/the-disturbing-world-of-dickflashcom">The Disturbing World of Dickflash.com</a>, a forum for flashers, who swap tips about how not to get caught, and who, regarding the NYC subway flasher were asking &#8216;Is this one of us?&#8217; Let&#8217;s hope so, people.</li>
<li>
Also at <strong>Jezebel</strong>, and very NSFW let us add, is this article by Irin Carmon, on <a href="http://jezebel.com/5693656/how-your-playboy-centerfold-sausage-is-made-nsfw?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+jezebel/full+%28Jezebel%29">Playboy models and Photoshopping</a>.</li>
<li>You&#8217;re probably seen the <strong>Privilege Denying Dude</strong> meme &#8211; here&#8217;s <a href="http://colorlines.com/archives/2010/11/social_justice_comedy.html">an interview with the creator of the meme</a>, Diana Lopez, at <strong>Colorlines, </strong>and as at the time of posting the site is currently down (although shortly to return, we hear, with a new model), you can keep up with her, and further news of PDD, <a href="http://jazzonia.tumblr.com/">at her tumblr account</a>.</li>
