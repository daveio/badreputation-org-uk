										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Team BadRep were put on the spot again this month: in the wake of <a href="http://dcwomenkickingass.tumblr.com/post/7985599811/panels">SDCC Batgirl</a> igniting the gender-and-comics conversation loud &#8216;n&#8217; proud, the team were asked to take a look at their favourite comic book titles and characters &#8211; some obvious choices, some less so&#8230; here&#8217;s Sarah C&#8217;s take.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Ah, comics. Or <em>graphic novels</em>, if they are trying to seduce me across a pseudy coffee bar in Edinburgh, which they did &#8211; more on that later.</p>
<p>Dear reader, this is a tale of a long, passionate, but fractious love affair.</p>
<p>It started early. I noticed them, but they never seemed to be the right one for me, stocked as they were in the &#8220;boys&#8217; section&#8221; of the magazine racks. I kept myself busy with the garish colours of the (probably) gender neutral <a href="http://www.dandy.com/"><strong>Dandy</strong></a> and the <a href="http://www.beano.com/"><strong>Beano</strong></a>. Whilst being amused but ultimately concerned by the levels of naughtiness from <a href="http://www.beano.com/characters/minnie-the-minx">Minnie the Minx</a> (I was a very conscientious child), I found myself captured by a few sections from the pages of hand-me-down copies of the now-defunct &#8220;girls&#8217; own&#8221; annual <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunty"><strong>Bunty</strong></a>. Looking back on it, the artwork was poor and the storylines were hammy with a sprinkling of schmaltz, but some stood out: tales of mystery, adventure, aliens and heroines were hidden amidst the pages of dreary &#8220;girl stuff&#8221;. Now we&#8217;re talking!</p>

<p>Flash forward, and I&#8217;m at university in Edinburgh with actual money in my pocket. I&#8217;ve caught flickers of images in such hallowed sanctuaries as <a href="http://forbiddenplanet.com/">Forbidden Planet</a>, which is exciting but mostly full of plastic models. <a href="http://www.deadheadcomics.co.uk/">Deadhead</a>, lurking on the crooked medieval road across from the pub where I&#8217;ve just earned my actual money, is poky and rammed with paper; pleasingly reminiscment in layout and smell of old bookshops.</p>
<p>On the shelves I spot a beautifully painted (thank you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_Fegredo">Duncan Fegredo</a>) issue of Mike Carey&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer_%28DC_Comics%29"><strong>Lucifer</strong></a>, where a winged schoolgirl escapes the giant maw of a fiery demon; the first of the new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catwoman"><strong>Catwoman</strong></a> where Selina Kyle is resplendent and powerful in a jumpsuit and combat boots; and the gothic lusciousness of Serena Valentino&#8217;s  <a href="http://serenavalentino.com/gloomcookie/"><strong>GloomCookie</strong></a>. <em>And that was just the covers!</em></p>

<p>The stories, oh, oh, oh the stories. Magical, fantastical, intricate and complex tales of all kinds with interesting and varied female characters being just as magical, just as fantastically intricate and complex as their male counterparts.</p>
<p>I am doing my level best to just not list all of them because that would be a little tedious &#8211; check the Wiki articles or better yet come round and read them &#8211; my point is that they were there, and they were<em> so far</em> removed from any other female heroes (or anti-heroes, or villains) that I had ever seen before, and there were just SO MANY of them.</p>
<p>Over the next many years I spent a lot of time and money on comics. I was in love.  Besotted. I compulsively collected every issue of the jaw-dropping <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fables_%28comics%29"><strong>Fables</strong></a> and <a href="http://www.dccomics.com/vertigo/graphic_novels/?gn=1736"><strong>Y: The Last Man</strong></a> (a must for any comic collection). As I tend to be when in love, I was somewhat obsessed. I wrote my dissertation on postmodernist structuralism in Grant Morrison&#8217;s <a href="http://www.barbelith.com/bomb/"><strong>The Invisibles</strong></a> (I know better now, it should have been postmodern superhero archetypes in <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Doom_Patrol:_Crawling_from_the_Wreckage"><strong>Doom Patrol</strong></a>).</p>
<p>I found the most perfect fairy tale ever told in the form of Jeff Smith&#8217;s independent offering <a href="http://www.boneville.com/"><strong>Bone</strong></a>. This is an epic adventure of derring do, lost princesses who need to save the kingdom, war, friendship, quiche and dragons. I cannot recommend it enough.<br />

<p>The character of Grandma Ben blasts away so many female stereotypes. She is mysterious, strong, forthright, takes no nonsense and just plain funny.  She also races cows. As in, races against them. I aim to also do this when I am her age (which she refuses to tell anyone, of course).</p>
<p>But as I read my way through everything that caught my eye, I was spotting a change.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Transmetropolitan_characters#Yelena_Rossini">Filthy Assistant number two</a> Yelena Rossini romped her way through Warren Ellis&#8217; <strong>Transmetropolitan</strong> and stole my heart somewhat with her hard smoking, futuristic gumshoe gonzo journalism and attack womb. Zee Hernandez from Brian Wood&#8217;s spectacular <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMZ_%28comics%29"><strong>DMZ</strong></a> played Beatrice to the lost photographer and guided both him and the reader through a ghastly vision of New York as the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>These women were still good, still interesting, but they were second fiddle, playing traditional (albeit revamped and turbo-boosted) support roles such as healers and helpmeets whilst also filling the &#8220;minority quota&#8221;, especially in the case of Zee who is both non-white and non-male. Naturally all of them end up sleeping with or as love interests for the male protagonists, although at least the storylines of those titles made up for the stereotypes.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the way, it started to go wrong. Bit by bit by bit, even these characters faded away. The series that I loved ended (I cried at the end of <strong>Lucifer</strong>) and were replaced with weaker, less interesting versions. Costumes became smaller, boobs bigger. I started my &#8220;never buy a comic where the cover art has a woman with breasts bigger than her head&#8221; campaign, and found myself wealthier but with a<em> lot less</em> comics.</p>
<p>Female characters and their stories became less widely available. There were still some bright sparks but these were increasingly ghettoised in the narrow &#8220;independent&#8221; section of the store or as part of autobiographical works such as the excellent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persepolis_%28comics%29"><strong>Persepolis</strong></a>. The lack of new work meant that shops began pushing long-standing books like <a href="http://www.strangersinparadise.com/"><strong>Strangers in Paradise</strong></a> or reprints of classics  obviously aimed at women such as <a href="http://dykestowatchoutfor.com/"><strong>Dykes to Watch Out For</strong></a>.</p>
<p>There were still good stories in comic book world, with great artwork, but the women I had come to love had gone missing from the mainstream. Titles such as <strong>Wonder Woman</strong> or <strong>Lady Death</strong> looked like bad pornography, and the artwork for some of my favourite writers became downright ridiculous to the point of offensive. My relationship with comics was getting rocky.</p>
<p>I can pinpoint the exact moment that caused us to break up. It was <a href="http://www.ignitioncity.com/"><strong>Ignition City</strong></a> by Warren Ellis, specifically the way that almost every page had a massive pair of tits or tight (female) bottom in it, regardless of whether that was particularly appropriate or relevant. The male characters, of course, could be as fat, wrinkly, gross, old, multicultural and multidimensional as actual people. The female characters only existed to ensure that there were toned body parts for the consumption of the reader (who obviously wasn&#8217;t meant to be me).</p>
<p>What happened to my love?  What changed? I don&#8217;t know. I have moved to pastures new &#8211; online comics such as <a href="http://www.freakangels.com/"><strong>Freak Angels</strong></a>, <a href="http://www.girlgeniusonline.com/"><strong>Girl Genius</strong></a>, <a href="http://www.sinfest.net/"><strong>Sinfest</strong></a> and <a href="http://xkcd.com/"><strong>XKCD</strong></a> fulfill my panel-related addiction, but every now and then I look longingly at my groaning bookshelf with all those beautiful trade paperbacks, wondering when, if ever, there might be a return to form.</p>
<p>Come back, baby. I miss you.</p>

<p>Fantastic artist <A href="http://egypt.urnash.com/about.html"><strong>Egypt Urnash</strong></a> drew this for free, as a &#8220;t-shirt design for a college SF club&#8221;. It was then linked to by Major Internet Deity <A href="http://www.warrenellis.com/?p=12739">Warren Ellis</a>, who knows groovy stuff when he sees it, and subsequently the design is now selling as <A href="http://www.deviantart.com/print/19408301/?">framed art prints</a> and <A href="http://www.redbubble.com/people/egypturnash/t-shirts/7176075-what-science-fiction-means-to-me">t-shirts</a>.</p>
<p>Why do I love this so much?</p>
<p>Possibly because it could have been titled &#8220;What I want to be when I grow up&#8221; (and still apply to me and most of Team BadRep now, if we&#8217;re honest). It has a shark with a frickin&#8217; laser on its head, which is always good for +10 points, but it&#8217;s got to be the sheer joy on the girl&#8217;s face. I think I just have an innate love of anything which could legitimately have the caption &#8220;YEAH BABY, YEAH!&#8221;</p>
<p>At a time when <a href="http://asknicola.blogspot.com/2011/05/shocking-uk-sf-favourites-score-men-500.html">women seem to be shockingly under-represented in Sci-fi</a> (way beyond the ratio of actual female authors to male) and <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/booksblog/2011/may/31/women-science-fiction-writers">hearty debate on whether that&#8217;s because of sexism or other factors</a>, I&#8217;m delighted at anything which tells young women they have a central place in SF. (The first link references Joanna Russ&#8217; &#8220;How to suppress women&#8217;s writing&#8221;, which <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/05/10/joanna-russ-1937-2011/" />we mentioned ourselves recently</a>.) </p>
<p>Women of all ages <em>should</em> be holding the rayguns and riding the space-sharks, dammit. After all, <a href="http://www.wiscon.info/" />WisCon</a> (&#8216;the World&#8217;s leading feminist science fiction convention&#8217;) has just finished, and once again shows the potential of the genre not only to excite and speak to everyone, but to be a blank slate where <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/10/26/laser-guns-can-save-us-from-the-anti-pc-brigade/" />current prejudices don&#8217;t have to be brought along</a>. SF could be a feminist&#8217;s best friend.</p>

To get us started, why don&#8217;t you tell us a bit about <em>Róisín Dubh </em>, which has just gone on release.</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://roisindubhcomic.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Róisín Dubh</strong></a> is a three-issue comic book series that will also be collected and bound as a graphic novel. It&#8217;s set in Ireland in 1899 and follows the adventures of Róisín Sheridan, an eighteen-year-old woman who harbours ambitions to be an actress. Her life is altered forever when she and her parents are attacked on the road by a bloodthirsty man called Abhartach who has just risen from the earth. Róisín&#8217;s parents are killed and she is left for dead&#8230; until she is given a mission by ancient powers. She has to go against the conventions of the day, and her previous notions of what is possible, to try and put Abhartach back in the ground&#8230; but the person who raised Abhartach from his 1,400-year stasis has other plans.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>What might feminist readers enjoy about the comic? As if an Irish suffragette killing demons isn&#8217;t enough to get anyone interested&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I hope there&#8217;s plenty there for everyone, but the women&#8217;s suffrage movement was on my mind from the start. Róisín has had a liberal, educated upbringing, she was allowed a lot of leeway as a child, but as a woman she&#8217;s starting to discover that there are more limits on her than she imagined.</p>
<p>For instance, that simple thing her father says to her: <a href="http://roisindubhcomic.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/rd1-1-3new1.jpg"><em>of course women should have the right to vote&#8230; but a career on the stage? It&#8217;s disreputable.</em> </a>The struggle for equal rights is a slow erosion of the <em>but</em>s. People are always full of reasons why you can have some rights, but not all.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why Róisín has a bike. People forget that the bicycle was a huge boon to women in the nineteenth century &#8211; it gave them a freedom of movement that they didn&#8217;t enjoy previously, and it also helped bring about a change in clothing.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_B._Anthony">Susan B. Anthony</a> said in 1896 that she thought the bicycle &#8216;has done more to emancipate women than anything else in the world, It gives a woman a feeling of freedom and self-reliance. The moment she takes her seat she knows she can&#8217;t get into harm unless she gets off her bicycle, and away she goes, the picture of free, untrammeled womanhood.'&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>What sort of heroine is Róisín &#8211; who is she as a character? Which other comic book heroines have inspired you in the past and what do you like about them?</strong></p>

The events in the comic book means she&#8217;s forced to deal with tragedy while learning she has far less control over her life. These are the kinds of lessons we often learn in life, although in Róisín&#8217;s case they involve an undead creature, magicians and ancient Irish divinities!</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t drawn upon any other comic book heroines consciously in relation to Róisín, but there were a number that had an impact upon me over the years. First was Judge Anderson in <strong>2000 AD</strong>. I didn&#8217;t read many American comics when I was growing up in Ireland as there weren&#8217;t many available at the time. <strong>2000 AD</strong> was the premiere title for young teens then, so I read it too. Her first appearance in the Judge Death storyline (written by John Wagner and drawn by Brian Bolland) ticked all the boxes for me: horror and a great female lead.</p>
<p>What I loved about Anderson was her humour. She was the only one who poked fun at Dredd, and I loved that the Psi-Division were given loads of leeway because of the job they did and the high risk of their brains being fried in the process. Plus, she saves the world through an extreme act of self-sacrifice (thankfully, she didn&#8217;t remain in stasis forever!).</p>
<p>A while ago I read a comment on a website by one of the early artists of Anderson, in which he said he thought that she wasn&#8217;t very complex and was created for a bit of titillation for the lads. That comment disappointed me greatly. I guess he didn&#8217;t realise that Anderson was one of the <em>very few</em> women in <strong>2000 AD</strong> at the time, and for that reason alone she had a big impact on the girls/women who read the series. Having a representation of women in comics book series is really important, and Dredd himself is not exactly the most complex character! I don&#8217;t usually hanker after writing particular characters, but writing Anderson would be a dream project.</p>
<p>Another character that had a big impact was <strong>Tank Girl</strong> (Jamie Hewlett and Alan Martin). She had a punk sensibility and a sense of humour, and liked sex, drugs and driving a tank &#8211; what was not to love?</p>
<p>Other characters I like are David Mack&#8217;s <strong>Scarab</strong>, <strong>Storm</strong> from the <strong>X-Men</strong> (woefully underused, I think), Alan Moore&#8217;s <strong>Halo Jones</strong> (another character I&#8217;d kill to write) and <strong>Promethea</strong>, Warren Ellis&#8217;s <strong>Jenny Sparks</strong>, and finally, the goddess herself, <strong>Wonder Woman</strong>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve only fallen in love with the Wonder Woman character in the past year, which is completely the result of <strong>Gail Simone</strong>&#8216;s amazing writing. I&#8217;m also now a big fan of Simone&#8217;s <strong>Secret Six</strong> and <strong>Birds of Prey</strong> &#8211; so you can include all the (many) female characters in those series on my list now. Simone is one of the best comic book writers in the industry in my opinion, and she&#8217;s particularly adept at dialogue, especially for the female characters. Her comic books consistently pass the <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2005/10/16/badrepwiki-the-bechdel-test/">Bechdel Test</a>, which so many titles still don&#8217;t do.&#8221;</p>

What have you learned from this so far, and has it ever worked against you?</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;No change occurs if you remain silent. It&#8217;s that simple &#8211; but it&#8217;s not necessarily easy to speak up.</p>
<p>As a woman you know a likely response to raising an issue &#8211; such as the lack of women at an event &#8211; is that you will be dismissed or attacked (especially on the Internet).</p>
<p>So, I always strive to be fair and logical in how I present my case. Sometimes that&#8217;s difficult because I feel so passionately about women getting a fair shake &#8211; well, everyone getting a fair shake, no matter their gender, ethnicity, sexuality, etc.</p>
<p>A number of people have asked me if I think I&#8217;m damaging my career with some of the issues I&#8217;ve raised. So far I&#8217;ve never experienced it, but would it stop me? No.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s be realistic. I&#8217;m speaking out on issues from a pretty safe environment. If I was a female union representative in Mexico &#8211; for example &#8211; I would have a genuine risk in speaking up. Or a mother trying to access education for her girls in Afghanistan. Those people inspire me &#8211; they are taking real risks with their lives and yet find the courage to stand up for what is right.</p>
<p>When I think of that it puts what I do in perspective! (And it makes me donate to aid organisations that help people in those risky situations.)&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Come back tomorrow for Part 2 of our interview. Warm thanks to Maura for talking to us.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are two things I want to get out of the way before I start telling you about the film today.  Firstly:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>*** There are spoilers in this!***</strong></p>
<p>Oh man.  Three things, then.  <em>Three</em> things.  <em>Second </em>thing is, I am a dangerously massive fanboy for Warren Ellis.  I don&#8217;t really like going into a film already biased either for or against its artistic merits, but I was practically eating my own face with anticipation for this one.</p>
<p>And thirdly, I am also madly in love with Helen Mirren and Morgan Freeman.  Helen Mirren is so badass I don&#8217;t know if I want to be her best friend or be her.  Morgan Freeman&#8217;s voice alone turns me into a glowing pillar of delight.  The mere fact that they are near each other, in the same shot sometimes, in <strong>RED </strong>(they&#8217;re on the poster!  Both of them!  Simultaneously!) is like cinematographical manna from heaven being fed directly into my brain through a <em>glee tube</em>.</p>
<p>So please remember that this film was seen through the eyes of what was basically a person fully transformed into a ziggurat of pure fandom; an obelisk of moist-eyed admiration.  Consequently, any words that have issued from my fingers as I type this have been vetted for inappropriate levels of fanboy, but I can&#8217;t promise that I&#8217;ll have caught all of them.  I can promise, however, that I have done my best.</p>
<p>But first off &#8211; and I&#8217;d really like to get this out of the way, because I think we all noticed it, didn&#8217;t we &#8211; there&#8217;s one scene that made me actually shout &#8220;NO!&#8221; in the cinema and made people look at me in disgust (sorry, Vue Cambridge!).</p>
<p>Okay.  The scene is this: Helen Mirren&#8217;s character, Victoria, gets shot in the abdomen in such a way that she genuinely thinks her life is at stake, and she prepares for a final showdown, unarmed and bleeding from the gut, and then! a man saves her.  He literally sweeps her off her combat-booted feet and whisks her off to safety.</p>
<p>This is a cliché that we have ingrained into our social consciousness as thoroughly and as needlessly fictionally as &#8220;frogs turn into princes when adequately tongued.&#8221;  &#8220;Woman cannot save self; man saves woman.&#8221;  At least the frog-kissing trope doesn&#8217;t then translate across into how people commonly regard frogs.  But this &#8220;women are crap and need saving&#8221; bollocks translates, doesn&#8217;t it?  You get it everywhere, from fairytales to adverts; this pointless, condescending infantilism.  This is a point at which I would like to refer you to Bill Bailey&#8217;s magnificent <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQhnXcmPXV0" target="_blank">&#8220;Beautiful Ladies&#8221;</a> song, which tears the piss out of this trope perfectly.</p>
<blockquote><p>Beautiful ladies, in emergency situations!<br />
Beautiful ladies are lovely, but sometimes they don&#8217;t take care<br />
They&#8217;re too busy with their makeup, or combing their lovely hair<br />
To take basic safety precautions.</p></blockquote>
<p>The most aggravating thing about it is that &#8211; well, okay, some viewers may find that it made the re-emergence of this cliché <em>less annoying</em> &#8211; Helen Mirren kicks fourteen types of arse in this.  She has a free-mounted machine gun.  She blasts her way through waves of drones with John Malkovich meekly in the background handing her more guns.  She explicitly changes out of her heels into a nice pair of combat boots to handle the violence.  She knows surgery and hides guns under flower-arranging.  So, for me, to have her punctured and enlimpened like a party balloon just made me want to cry.</p>
<div style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm5.static.flickr.com/4145/5167126365_68e9a59956_o.png?resize=550%2C546" alt="Image: cartoon illustration of an alternate outcome for Helen Mirren's character in RED, titled 'How I Wish That Bit Had Gone': &quot;Oh, a gunshot wound. HA! Fools! I know... surgery!&quot; " width="550" height="546" data-recalc-dims="1" /><p class="wp-caption-text">And then she SMASHED STUFF</p></div>
<p>That said, I was so delighted by her character that I was genuinely pleased that she&#8217;d been saved, rather than sacrificed.  So the getting-saved-by-a-man was more pleasing to me than if she hadn&#8217;t, and been left to die, but she&#8217;s an epic-level character!  She shouldn&#8217;t be shot down by a faceless NPC<sup><a href="/2010/11/23/at-the-movies-red/#footnote_0_1021" id="identifier_0_1021" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" Non-player Character for the non-nerds. I&rsquo;m sorry, everyone. ">1</a></sup> in the first place!</p>
<p>So there&#8217;s that.</p>
<p>On the whole, though, <strong>RED</strong> absolutely delighted me.  The dialogue is hilarious, the action sequences beautifully shot and choreographed, and the whole thing is a visual feast.  The characters are chunky and believable &#8211; yes, including The Girl, the love interest, the object of obsession &#8211; and while they&#8217;re all deeply flawed in some critical respect, they&#8217;re likeable.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take Bruce Willis&#8217;s character, Frank.  He&#8217;s the hero.  He&#8217;s badass in pretty much every respect, but his treatment of The Love Interest, Sarah (Mary Louise Parker), at the beginning is absolutely repulsive.  We are right by her side when she makes a bid for escape &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t matter if what he says is best for her and that we&#8217;ve seen his house shot to pieces, the fact of the matter is that he has BROKEN INTO HER HOUSE AND KIDNAPPED HER.  As she says, &#8220;You can&#8217;t just go around duct-taping people&#8221;.  And we can absolutely sympathise with her.  She&#8217;s just an ordinary person.  And you <em>can&#8217;t</em> just go around duct-taping people.</p>
<p>I actually loved her to bits.  She felt like someone I knew, and the scene where she brazens her way out of a Situation In A Lift is a spectacular testament to how ordinary people can rise to a challenge.  She&#8217;s great.  Also, that&#8217;s a very gratifying example of her saving <em>Frank</em>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this film was given an opportunity to <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2005/10/16/badrepwiki-the-bechdel-test/">pass the Bechdel Test</a>.  Sarah and Victoria are left alone in the snow, while Victoria takes aim at some kneecaps with a sniper rifle.  They discuss Frank.  And then Victoria threatens to kill Sarah and hide the body.  So it had this whole assenting-to-trope/subversion thing going on.  The opportunity was there! But sadly missed!  But I think it also does just go to show that a film doesn&#8217;t have to pass the Bechdel Test to also have brilliant female characters in (and visa versa: <strong>Sex And The City 2</strong> springs to mind&#8230;).</p>
<p>Because it does, you know.  It&#8217;s not just Sarah and Victoria (HELENNNN) that are brilliant in this; a tiny bit-part background character with no name gets held at gunpoint by John Malkovich&#8217;s marvellously paranoid Marvin.  He declaims her as following them, and having a gun in her handbag.  This is awful; she is terrified and shaking, and Marvin is the bad guy.  And then, it is revealed that yes, she <em>was </em>following them, and yes, she does have a gun.  It is a rocket launcher.  And if that&#8217;s not brilliant, I don&#8217;t know what is.  The gun-wielding grunt role isn&#8217;t just restricted to the men in this film.  And that&#8217;s good.  I&#8217;m up for that.  Let us have equal opportunities in both our heroes AND our villains.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>YOU SHOULD SEE THIS FILM BECAUSE:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>The dialogue is hewn from purest diamond genius</li>
<li>The characters make sense and are, despite their flaws, readily engageable-with</li>
<li>There is a real estate agent with a rocket launcher</li>
<li>It looks edibly good</li>
<li><em>HELEN MIRREN</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>YOU SHOULD NOT SEE THIS FILM BECAUSE:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Helen Mirren gets shot and has to be rescued by a man and that is boring</li>
<li>Helen Mirren doesn&#8217;t play all the roles</li>
</ul>
