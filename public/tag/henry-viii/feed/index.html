<h2 style="text-align: center">WIDOW</h2>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ll say one thing: the war makes the most peculiar widows.</p>
<p>Rhett Butler, <strong>Gone With The Wind </strong>(1939)</p></blockquote>
<h3>Bootylicious</h3>
<p><em>Widow </em>is another Old English word, <em>widewe</em> (= widow&#8230;), which connects via the Indo-European <em>vidhava</em>, with the Latin <em>viduus</em>, meaning &#8216;bereft&#8217; or (its other lexical descendent) &#8216;void&#8217;. This &#8216;vacancy&#8217; at the etymological heart of the word seems perfect, if rather sad, since (as we all know) a widow is &#8216;a woman who has lost her husband by death and has not married again&#8217;.</p>
<div id="attachment_4526" style="width: 278px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/446px-Queen_Victoria_photographed_by_George_Washington_Wilson_1863.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4526" data-attachment-id="4526" data-permalink="/2011/03/28/an-alphabet-of-feminism-23-w-is-for-widow/446px-queen_victoria_photographed_by_george_washington_wilson_1863/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/446px-Queen_Victoria_photographed_by_George_Washington_Wilson_1863.jpg?fit=446%2C599&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="446,599" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Queen Victoria on a horse" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/446px-Queen_Victoria_photographed_by_George_Washington_Wilson_1863.jpg?fit=223%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/446px-Queen_Victoria_photographed_by_George_Washington_Wilson_1863.jpg?fit=446%2C599&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-4526 " src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/446px-Queen_Victoria_photographed_by_George_Washington_Wilson_1863.jpg?resize=268%2C359" alt="A grumpy-looking Queen Victoria, wearing black, sits on a horse with a man in a kilt holding the reins." width="268" height="359" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/446px-Queen_Victoria_photographed_by_George_Washington_Wilson_1863.jpg?w=446&amp;ssl=1 446w, https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/446px-Queen_Victoria_photographed_by_George_Washington_Wilson_1863.jpg?w=223&amp;ssl=1 223w" sizes="(max-width: 268px) 100vw, 268px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-4526" class="wp-caption-text">'The Widow at Windsor' - Queen Victoria in 1863, after Albert's death in 1861</p></div>
<p>Anyway, the emptiness immanent in the word <em>widow </em>is materially rather ironic, since, in European history at least, a lucky woman whose family had thrashed out a good <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/01/10/an-alphabet-of-femininism-13-m-is-for-marriage/">dower-deal</a> at her marriage was, in theory, entitled to most of the death-booty – as long as she didn&#8217;t marry Shakespeare and end up with the &#8216;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Hathaway_(Shakespeare)#Shakespeare.27s_Will">second best bed</a>&#8216;, or fall foul of anti-female legalities (as in Austen&#8217;s <strong>Sense and Sensibility</strong>).</p>
<p>But if we assume all has gone right and your wealthy husband has obligingly shuffled off this mortal coil and done nothing unexpected with his will, <em>widowhood </em>comes with a golden handshake. Even a little bit of money leaves you with a degree of important independence, and historical <em>widows</em> have frequently exploited this, becoming, in some instances, iconic political figures. Notable <em>widows</em> of history have included: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiang_Qing">Jiang Qing</a>, wife of Chairman Mao and leader of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang_of_Four_(China)">Gang of Four</a>; the dowager <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_de'_Medici">Catherine de Medici</a>, who machinated throughout the French Wars of Religion; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrippina_the_Younger">Agrippina the Younger</a>, super-Freudian mother of Nero; late-period <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> (dubbed &#8216;The Widow at Windsor&#8217;); <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Parr">Catherine Parr</a>, Henry VIII&#8217;s last wife (and the most married queen in English history), whose main distinction is that she &#8216;survived&#8217; &#8230; and even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacqueline_Kennedy_Onassis">Jackie Kennedy Onassis</a>, if you&#8217;re into that sort of thing.</p>
<h3>Scottish Widows</h3>
<p>On a more casual note, the independent <em>widow </em>was a culturally significant figure throughout European history, often dubbed the <strong>Merry Widow</strong>, as was the eponymous heroine of Franz Lehár&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Merry_Widow">operetta</a> (1905). Not only does Lehár&#8217;s <em>widow</em> have her own <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ5ekXKMjws">theme tune</a>, she also sparked a self-titled <a href="http://edwardianpromenade.com/fashion/the-merry-widow/">hat-craze</a>, and attentive readers will note that this &#8216;ornate or wide-brimmed hat&#8217; is worn at a <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/02/14/an-alphabet-of-femininism-18-–-r-is-for-rake/">rakish</a> angle that rather suits <em>Merry Widow</em>&#8216;s dictionary definition as a bereaved woman who is &#8216;amorous or designing&#8217;.</p>
<p>This idea goes back to the medieval age: the Scottish William Dunbar&#8217;s brilliantly phonetic poem &#8216;The Tretis of the Tua Mariit Wemen and the Wedo&#8217; features a <em>widow</em> who sits in a field telling two married women she&#8217;s found from somewhere about the comparative excellence of her own state:</p>
<blockquote><p>With him died all my dole and my dreary thoughts;<br />
Now done is my duly night, my day is upsprungen,<br />
Adieu dolour, adieu! My dainty now begins:<br />
Now am I a widow, i-wis, and well am at ease&#8230;</p>
<p>William Dunbar, <a href="http://www.thomondgate.net/pdf/Dunbar/Dunbar_3.__Tretis_of_the_Tua_Mariit_Wemen_Glossed___subheads.pdf">The Two Married Women and the Widow</a> c.1490s</p></blockquote>
<p>Anyone familiar with Chaucer&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wife_of_Bath's_Tale">Wife of Bath</a> may recognise something of Alysoun&#8217;s archness here – unlike the other Older Woman, the <em>old maid</em>, the <em>widow </em>is a legitimately sexually experienced woman, often with a bit of money, who has, in consequence, less to lose than the young <em>maiden</em>. With this licence, the medieval <em>widow </em>is frequently presented as a bawdy sexual facilitator, and she is also free herself to run riot, cause scandals, wander around unchaperoned and facilitate other people&#8217;s sexual encounters with relative impunity.</p>

<h3>Staring at the Sea</h3>
<p>Of course, it&#8217;s not all sitting in fields and enjoying your inheritance: the <em>widow</em>&#8216;s independent fortune certainly makes her a target for gold-diggers – as is the case with every <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3FZ_jtDMVg">Margaret Dumont</a> character in every Marx Brothers film ever. There are also lots of interesting cases in literature where you know the absent husband&#8217;s in trouble because the vultures are circling round his wife – Odysseus&#8217; Penelope is for a time a <em>widow </em>in the word&#8217;s second sense: &#8216;a wife separated from (or deserted by) her husband&#8217;. In addition to this, she also has to contend with house full of Suitors drinking her out of house and home on the (misguided) assumption that Odysseus is dead, rather than simply shagging Calypso on an island far, far away.</p>
<p>Penelope&#8217;s <em>widow</em>hood also lurks at the back of the North American term <em>Widow&#8217;s Walk,</em> &#8216;a railed or balustraded platform built on the roof, originally in early New England, for providing an unimpeded view of the sea&#8217;, and a highly evocative phrase suggestive of young Scarlett O&#8217;Hara-style sea-<em>widows</em>, whose British equivalents would probably have been provided for by the financial services company <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Widows">Scottish Widows</a>, first set up in 1815 as a way to provide for <a href="http://www.afoolandhismoney.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/scottishwidows.jpg">(sexy) <em>widows</em></a>, sisters and daughters whose husbands were lost in the Napoleonic Wars.</p>
<p>The Penelopean <em>widow</em> doesn&#8217;t really exist any more, but <em>widow</em>&#8216;s second meaning has a more modern significance first spotted in Late Middle English &#8211; &#8216;a wife whose husband devotes most of his time to a specified activity and is rarely at home&#8217;. Some readers may have heard the term &#8216;<em>World Cup Widow</em>&#8216; bandied about last year – other examples the dictionary gives include &#8216;<em>golf widow</em>&#8216; (sweet jeebus, get out of that one sistah&#8230;) and &#8216;<em>business widow</em>&#8216;. There&#8217;s also the more niche example of the &#8216;Secret Society Widow&#8217; – the <a href="http://www.freemasonry.london.museum/">Museum of Freemasonry</a> in Covent Garden has a rather nice clock on display that was presented to the wife of a member &#8216;in gratitude for her allowing her husband his Lodge nights&#8217;. Here there is a sense of these women as being passive blocks on enjoyment for someone else – the World Cup <em>Widow</em> is basically me moaning about having a sudden dip in loving attentions because there are men in ridiculous shorts running around on a screen in a noisy pub&#8230; Ahem. I digress.</p>
<h3>Kiss me in the shadow of a doubt</h3>
<p>Anyway, here we reach the flip-side of the <em>Merry Widow</em>, best exemplified in Alfred Hitchcock&#8217;s personal favourite of his own films, <strong>Shadow of a Doubt </strong>(1943). This features Joseph Cotton as the &#8216;Merry Widow Murderer&#8217; with a venomous attitude towards these <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEoTXa_52A0">&#8216;horrible, faded, fat, greedy women&#8217;</a> that may be extreme, but nonetheless exemplifies the idea that a <em>widow</em>&#8216;s financial independence actually renders her &#8216;useless&#8217; and a hindrance to earthly happiness (read: money) for everyone else. On this, there&#8217;s an interesting little typographic significance of <em>widow </em>first recorded in the mid-twentieth century &#8211; she is &#8216;a short last line of a page or column considered undesirable&#8217;. That is, the <em>widow </em>represents a kind of hangover, something that is surplus to requirement, and no longer neatly slotted into a clear, neat unit.</p>

<p>As well as being targets for Hitchcockian serial killers, <em>widows </em>can also adopt this role themselves of course – the <em>black widow </em>is a criminal female whose widowhood is assumed to have been – shall we say – voluntary. This phrase originates from the <em>black widow spider</em>, a venomous North American spider, especially <em>Latrodectus mactons</em>, &#8216;the female of which usually devours its mate&#8217;. A fear of female power and often source of grim fascination, this term works rather interestingly with notable Rock Widows – <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtney_Love">Courtney Love</a>, whom many genuinely accuse of having murdered Kurt Cobain; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoko_Ono">Yoko Ono</a>, who was never really a popular fave to begin with; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priscilla_Presley">Priscilla Presley</a> and even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faith_Evans">Faith Evans</a>, widow of The Notorious B.I.G. and the brains behind a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM0-ZU8njdo">dodgy reworking of The Police</a>.</p>
<p>These inevitably take on an important role as mediator of their husbands&#8217; glory, and living blocks on libel, speculation and marketing opportunities. Courtney Love famously &#8216;released&#8217; her husband&#8217;s suicide note to Nirvana fans and Yoko Ono wasted no time in putting together a posthumous Lennon album after his murder (reportedly showing up in the studio the very next day). The<a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/03/21/an-alphabet-of-feminism-22-v-is-for-vitriol/"> vitriol </a>these women have variously attracted presumably relates to a sense of the <em>widow </em>as a figure standing between fan and artist, with a hefty inheritance and a team of lawyers. It also compares curiously with the hatred or suspicion directed at many of the Political Widows with which this post began.</p>
<p>But ultimately there are as many different types of <em>widow </em>as there are <em>widows.</em> This post has attempted not so much to categorise them as to suggest a few ways people have regarded them: Jackie O (tragically graceful); political dowager (devious and suspect); the rich survivor draped in Chanel and gullibility – and a middle-aged Scottish woman sitting in a field, really quite content with her lot.</p>

<p>There are some letters in the dictionary that are more Latinate than others. In consequence, <em>u</em>, <em>v </em>and, to an extent, <em>o </em>are largely dominated by medical terminology (because doctors, bless &#8217;em, love a bit of <a href="http://www.novaroma.org/aquila/images/march05/lesson04.gif">Caecilius est in horto</a>). </p>

Henry VIII, after Holbein.</p></div>
<p><em> </em><em> </em><em> </em><em>Uterus </em>derives from a Latin homonym meaning &#8216;womb&#8217; or &#8216;belly&#8217;, with reference to the proto-Indo European<em> udero </em>(= &#8216;abdomen&#8217;), and, possibly, a Slavic usage, <em>vedro</em>, meaning &#8216;bucket&#8217;. Much like the &#8216;bucket&#8217; (and indeed the shape of the letter <em>u </em>with which the word commences), the first sense of <em>uterus </em>is as a vessel &#8211; &#8216;the organ in which the young are conceived, developed and protected till birth; the female organ of gestation; the womb&#8217;.</p>
<p>Much has been made of this &#8216;protective&#8217; element – it has been frequently observed that the &#8216;fetal&#8217; position babies adopt to fill the <em>uterus</em> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_position">endures into adulthood as a comforting or even instinctual reaction</a> to anxiety, pain, distress or cold – a kind of retrospective communion with the mother&#8217;s body. This sort of thing, it seems, <a href="http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/41427293/ns/today-todaytravel/">is not above a bit of marketing</a>, and the <em>uterus </em>is often invoked as a place of calm, darkness and peace.</p>
<p>Opposed to this, we have the sort of ambiguity nowhere better demonstrated than through tanks. (yes, tanks). The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_I_tank">Mark I </a>tank, the world&#8217;s first combat tank, was renamed from &#8216;Big Willie&#8217; to &#8216;Mother&#8217; (&#8230;), and its successors were colloquially dubbed &#8216;Mother&#8217; throughout both world wars. The reasons are obvious: the inside of a tank is small, hot and protective. Childlike, a crew could be forgiven for considering themselves invincible within it – yet once the fuel tank is hit, the men inside suffer a hideous, incestuous death, incinerated by their own machine. This sort of thing runs right the way through conceptions of the mother&#8217;s body, particularly in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis">psychoanalysis</a>, which is never tired of exposing the deeply conflictual nature of many mother-child relationships, and with mapping those onto the cisgendered female body – we might think particularly of Melanie Klein&#8217;s famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splitting_(psychology)#Melanie_Klein">&#8216;good breast&#8217; and &#8216;bad breast&#8217;</a>. If we&#8217;re going there.</p>
<p>HOWEVER. BACK TO THE RENAISSANCE. In its early incarnations in English this &#8216;womb&#8217; is rarely so clearly gendered (<a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/11/22/an-alphabet-of-femininism-8-h-is-for-hysteria/">as you may remember</a>, King Lear thinks he has one), and, true to its ambiguous etymology, early modern minds frequently considered the <em>uterus </em>to be a generic bodily pouch. Thus it was often conflated with the gender-neutral <em>belly </em>(ah, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isidore_of_Seville">Isidore of Seville</a>), and in this form it was thought to be proof of the body&#8217;s retentive faculties. So even when considered as a specifically reproductive organ, the thinking went, the <em>uterus </em>still resembles the digestive system in how long it takes to do its business, since it creates <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/11/29/an-alphabet-of-femininism-9-i-is-for-infant/">infants</a> over a leisurely period of nine months. While I doubt it takes quite that long for your morning Alpen, digestion is certainly something of a gradual process – consider, if you will, the hangover.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold;">Horn of Plenty</span></p>
<p>If you remember the Alphabet post on <em><a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/01/24/an-alphabet-of-femininism-15-o-is-for-ovary/">ovary</a> </em>(to which this is in many ways a companion), you may also remember that until the seventeenth century sex organs were considered to have analogues across the genders (penis = vagina, labia = foreskin and uterus = scrotum). Along with its reproductive and sack-like qualities – I am reminded of the beautifully named &#8216;<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/media/images/38102000/jpg/_38102498_babies_ap.jpg">Mermaid&#8217;s Purses</a>&#8216; – in this model the <em>uterus </em>also matches the <em>scrotum </em>in its creative properties. After all, reproduction is six of one and half-a-dozen of the other.</p>
<p>But this was not just something tossed around in the Renaissance lab and subsequently ignored: the scrotum-uterus comparison actually spread into what we might consider a bizarre arena – fashion. I am, of course, talking about the <em>codpiece</em>, &#8216;a bagged appendage to the front of the breeches; often conspicuous&#8217;. This was a sartorial fave of Henry VIII (above, right), who clearly took his outfits very seriously – but I note that sexy <a href="http://www.odt.co.nz/files/story/2009/10/jonathan_rhys_meyers_as_henry_viii_in_the_tudors_w_1666626344.jpg">Jonathan Rhys Meyers</a> has avoided the sexy codpiece throughout the BBC&#8217;s <strong><a href="http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2OTc2MTIwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjkwNTQ3._V1._SX450_SY600_.jpg">Sexy Tudors</a></strong>. Too sexy?</p>
<p>Originally a modesty device to get round the, ahem, &#8216;shortcomings&#8217; of the hose, this strange appendage quickly grew to a size that redefined it as a disturbing kind of hyper-masculine power-dressing. Yet the word derives from the Old English <em>codd </em>(<em>+ piece</em>), which came to mean &#8216;testicles&#8217; in early Medieval times (quite possibly because of exactly this phenomenon) but originally meant simply &#8216;a bag, pouch or husk&#8217;. Indeed, the <em>codpiece </em>was frequently dubbed a <em>belly</em>, and, through fun with synonyms, the <em>womb </em>could become a <em>cod</em>: my good friend <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Making-Sex-Gender-Greeks-Freud/dp/0674543556">Thomas Laqueur</a> highlights the Pardoner&#8217;s exclamation &#8216;O wombe! O bely! O stynkyng cod!&#8217;, in the <em>Canterbury Tales</em>, and also points out that the codpiece quickly started to resemble&#8230;(I like this bit)&#8230; &#8216;a finely embroidered and bejewelled horn of plenty&#8217;.</p>

<p>So it seems that, while Henry VII might not thank you for it, we could observe that this most macho of garments is in fact drawing attention to the womb-like, generative, and retentive properties of what lurks within (which, of course, it also helped <em>protect </em>– gender-ambiguous Russian dolls, anyone?). Indeed, glancing at a couple of examples in portraiture, a <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_cpToIwY89Rc/S2CrnJLOSBI/AAAAAAAACAI/GCIi1nDDr80/s320/codpiece12_full.jpg">lot of these men</a> look rather like they have an <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_scczN8MdyKw/SSrrk14KNCI/AAAAAAAADE4/3cRnlccIumw/s400/Unknown+Man+D.jpg">artificially constructed <em>uterus </em></a>poised <a href="http://ty.rannosaur.us/wp-content/uploads/edwardvi.png">over their genitalia</a> (<a href="http://themurkyfringe.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/codpiece1.jpg">love how he&#8217;s pointing, just in case we miss it</a>). Less Blackadder, more&#8230; actually, I don&#8217;t know <em>what </em>that is.</p>
<h3>Bag for Life</h3>
<p>But, of course, eventually someone had to seize on anatomical differences to posit a definition of gender, and thus it that (around 1615) the <em>uterus </em>started to be considered something exclusively female – as regular readers will be aware, this was a chain that began with independent naming of the organ in question and eventually reached the pitches of <em><a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/11/22/an-alphabet-of-femininism-8-h-is-for-hysteria/">hysteria</a> </em>in the nineteenth century. There is also a strange quasi-legal term, <em>uterine</em>, apparently first spotted in the seventeenth century but not dictionary-cited until 1816, meaning &#8216;related through the mother&#8217;. Thus, &#8216;the property devolves to his brothers or uterine uncles&#8217;, with the body of the mother here serving a dynastic link, since all these uncles can be proved to have shared a uterus. They could even be half-brothers, since an alternative meaning for <em>uterine </em>is &#8216;having the same mother, but not the same father&#8217;. Working on a similar premise, if you are particularly toolish, and your sister has a son, you would (in pre-paternity test times) have been best off leaving your money to your nephew: his link to you is purely <em>uterine</em>, unlike your link to your son, who could be anyone&#8217;s spawn.</p>
<p>As we draw near the end of the Alphabet series, threads begin to resolve themselves. <em>Uterus </em>has been the final word of three (<em>hysteria </em>and <em>ovary </em>were the other two)<em> </em>all of which address the issue of mapping the cisgendered female body. Following the three, we have seen a model of sex and gender that does not conform with what many experience as the current status quo. Conversely, the distinction between genders does not seem to have been primarily based on the body until the nineteenth century (or even later). Thus, we have seen <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XR2BcRwiG-sC&amp;pg=PA127&amp;lpg=PA127&amp;dq=marie+germain+montaigne&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wUFyuQjNb2&amp;sig=ljtQ1Xb5-TMH8RfJfyae_XtbgGg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=plY8TYLHBpGYhQeqjJGxCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=marie%20germain%20montaigne&amp;f=false">women turning into men</a> with comparatively little contemporary comment, the female orgasm (and in some cases her entire sexual appetite) <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/10/11/an-alphabet-of-femininism-2-b-is-for-bitch/">vanish from the everyday realities of heterosexual sex</a>, and now, and perhaps most bizarrely, an epidemic of hyper-masculine men apparently walking around with giant <em>uteri </em>affixed over their genitalia. (Yes, I did just say &#8216;uteri&#8217;). Perhaps this is worth thinking about&#8230;</p>
