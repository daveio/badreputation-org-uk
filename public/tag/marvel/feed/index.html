<p>It&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve bought a paper comic. <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/08/08/comics-i-have-known-and-loved/" target="_blank">I was deeply in love with comics at one point in my life</a>. I swore off them a while ago for reasons of both taste &#8211; I&#8217;d run out of titles with female characters that I was interested in &#8211; and budget: it was one too many expensive habits for a theatre professional, and in the end, red wine won the day.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve kept a weather eye on the comics world, and the announcement of an all-female line-up for <strong>X-Men</strong> was enough to send me to Forbidden Planet. But what made me actually buy the thing despite the £3 price tag was writer <a href="http://www.brianwood.com/" target="_blank">Brian Wood</a> (<strong>DMZ</strong>, <strong>Channel Zero</strong> and <strong>Northlanders</strong>) and colourist Laura Martin (<strong>Planetary</strong>, <strong>Authority</strong> and <strong>JLA Earth 2</strong>, which all sit beautiful and bold on my shelves thanks in part to her palette choices and ability to make heroes look truly heroic).</p>
<p>Marvel introduce the issue <a href="http://comicstore.marvel.com/X-Men-1/digital-comic/29419" target="_blank">on their website</a> as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>Because you demanded it! The X-Women finally get their own book!</p></blockquote>
<p>So, a fan-based revolution in the world of comics? Perhaps. The title is part of Marvel NOW, the 2012 relaunch of the brand aiming to bring new readers into the market, or in my case, perhaps to bring readers back into the fold and into comic stores.</p>
<p>Could it be that the comic industry is  tackling the gap in the market for mainstream titles that are interesting to women? I&#8217;m heartened by the weight put behind this comic; it doesn&#8217;t seem to be a gimmick or an afterthought. The issue was heavily trailed with an <a href="http://www.bleedingcool.com/2013/01/07/brian-wood-and-olivier-coipels-xx-teaser-from-marvel-in-april/" target="_blank">XX teaser campaign</a>, which was hard not to notice. And what I&#8217;ve also been interested to note is the supportive voices around the line-up, with <a href="http://www.bleedingcool.com/2013/01/14/marvel-launches-an-all-female-x-men-book-called-x-men/">Bleeding Cool</a> praising Marvel for &#8220;raising their game in this regard&#8221; and other commentators using the launch as an opportunity to dedicate space to interviews with women in the industry, and to the importance of more titles about women, for women.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s <a href="http://www.clutchmagonline.com/2013/05/marvel-debuts-a-special-edition-all-women-x-men-comic/">a good piece here in <strong>Clutch</strong></a>, an <a href="http://www.themarysue.com/marvel-all-female-x-men-jeanine-schaefer/">interview with editor Jeanine Schafer over at <strong>The Mary Sue</strong></a>, and another piece <a href="http://bitchmagazine.org/post/marvel-debuts-a-new-series-the-all-women-x-men">here at <strong>Bitch</strong> magazine</a>.</p>
<p><strong>To me, my reviewers!</strong></p>
<p>The series features an all-female team including Storm, Jubilee, Rogue, Kitty Pryde, Rachel Grey (daughter of Scott and Jean) and Psylocke. They&#8217;re based at Jean Grey&#8217;s School for the Gifted and pitted against runaway trains, teenage tantrums in the hallway, and the arrival of John Sublime with a request for help.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m very pleased to see Storm&#8217;s mowhawk back in business, and Jubilee was always a favourite of mine from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men_%28TV_series%29">TV series</a>, even if she was often cast as a mutant girl version of <a href="http://thundercats.wikia.com/wiki/Snarf">Snarf.</a> She spoke to me of teenage wish-fulfilment, her mutant power always waiting in the wings for the right moment to shine, exactly like mine. Except my mutant power hasn&#8217;t developed yet. I&#8217;m sure it will.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s good about it? Lots. Lots and lots. The storyline moves on nicely, with a strong introduction that sets up future intrigue. It&#8217;s issue one, so I&#8217;ve not got a lot to go on, but so far it feels well-paced and with good action scenes and themes of homecoming (positive and negative) alongside the usual &#8220;outsider&#8221; politics that have always been a solid foundation for mutant-related plot.</p>
<p>The main characters get set up nicely and all showcase their abilities, personalities and range of powers. Jubilee and Kitty are set at a similar age and look like they are set to play out the roles of younger, naive/vulnerable characters, although there are two pupils at the school who look like they might also fill that position, so we&#8217;ll see. In terms of more experienced or older figures, Storm takes centre stage on the cover and is the team leader and headmistress with Rachel Grey as her second-in-command. Rogue is the powerhouse, and is shown enjoying herself being gung-ho in saving the day during a classic runaway train sequence, whilst Psylocke is pleasingly intimidating in the role of bad cop when Rachel interviews John Sublime.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s the usual balance of action/adventure with high school drama, much as you might expect, so in the future I&#8217;m hoping for something along the lines of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_X-Men_%282001_series%29">Grant Morrison&#8217;s <strong>New X Men</strong>.</a> This is referenced clearly through the young people at the school, so in those panels you can play a fun game of Guess Who? Mutant High Edition. This does also tend to lead on to a less fun game of Where Are We In What Passes For Continuity Around Here, but generally I take the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY_Ry8J_jdw" target="_blank">Doctor Who approach</a> on that one, so try not to get cross-eyed, basically.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t write this review without talking about how the characters look, partly because comics are a visual medium, but also because it&#8217;s so good to see a lot of the traditional problems of female representation overturned here. We have two non-white characters in the line-up, neither of whom are the xenophilia standard <a href="http://io9.com/5431487/sexy-blue-women/" target="_blank">sexy blue lady.</a> Almost all of the outfits in Olivier Coipel&#8217;s artwork are really nicely, thoughtfully designed and look very practical, including Rogue&#8217;s costume which comes complete with a hooded top. No spiked heels &#8211; or any of the <a href="http://bigotherbigother.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/new-x-men-135-cover.jpg" target="_blank">break-your-legs Girl Power stacks of Frank Quitely</a> &#8211; are in evidence. Everyone&#8217;s zippers go all the way up, with the sad exception of Storm who, in the words of a friend of mine, seems to have developed a secondary mutation allowing her outfit to stick to her breasts despite flying at speed. She&#8217;s clearly the Emma Frost replacement in the line-up.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to be charitable and say that the instances of female characters doing needlessly sexy poses is fairly low, but having passed the issue around a few friends (male and female) the mileage varies. That said, it&#8217;s certainly way below what I would have expected and certainly nowhere near the awful debacle that is <a href="http://io9.com/5844355/a-7+year+old-girl-responds-to-dc-comics-sexed+up-reboot-of-starfire" target="_blank">DC&#8217;s recent treatment of Starfire</a>. I could easily imagine a world in which an all-female X-Men line up could have been all bikinis, all the time&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Stormxmen-copy.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="13832" data-permalink="/2013/06/18/join-the-revolution-x-men-1-review/stormxmen-copy/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Stormxmen-copy.jpg?fit=981%2C1627&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="981,1627" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Stormxmen copy" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Stormxmen-copy.jpg?fit=181%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Stormxmen-copy.jpg?fit=617%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright  wp-image-13832" alt="Storm in action" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Stormxmen-copy.jpg?resize=264%2C437" width="264" height="437" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>If I&#8217;m being <em>un</em>charitable, I could say that it&#8217;s sad all the women are quite so perfect in how they look. Mutation offers such a variety of bodies to the writer and artist that it would have been good to see a character who subverted traditional expectations of what heroic women in comics should look like. A woman with the glorious curves of Morrison&#8217;s Angel Salvadore before she got reworked into a &#8220;prettier&#8221; version. Similarly, it&#8217;s a shame not to have an older female character to give something of the sagacity of Professor Xavier (can we make Helen Mirren a mutant already?), not to mention the fact that without him and without Cyclops the line-up could perhaps be seen as somewhat ableist compared to other line-ups.</p>
<p>All said and done though, this is only the beginning, and only a few pages. And in case it wasn&#8217;t clear: I really enjoyed it. I&#8217;ll spend money on the next one. A slim volume cannot hope to achieve everything that I might have wanted from a comic, but even if it weren&#8217;t an engaging start that has me hooked, it has already done an awful lot to show what female superheroes can do when well-written and well-drawn: tell a fantastic story that makes you wish your mutant powers would hurry up and kick in&#8230;</p>
<p>Does this herald a much-needed change and a step in the right direction for the future of comics? I hope so. But I&#8217;m hedging my bets, just in case I&#8217;m once again entirely cut off from my source of illustrative imaginings. Instead, I&#8217;ve been out on the wild plains of internet comics, on the hunt for decent female protagonists and generally doing pretty well &#8211; more on that in another post. Watch this panel.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I leave you with this quote I found in the slew of Google searches that I pass off as &#8220;research&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>For a bulky segment of a century, I have been an avid follower of comic strips &#8211; all comic strips (&#8230;) I cannot remember how the habit started, and I am presently unable to explain why it persists. I only know that I&#8217;m hooked, by now, that&#8217;s all.</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>Dorothy Parker, 1943</strong></p></blockquote>

					<description><![CDATA[Guest blogger Alyson Macdonald on why Gillen and McKelvie's Young Avengers is your new superhero comic to watch. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li><em><strong>Alyson Macdonald</strong>, who blogs for <a href="http://brightgreenscotland.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Bright Green</strong></a>, sent us this post. Do you have a guest post brewing in your brain? You know the drill: email us on <a href="mailto:badrepeditors@gmail.com">badrepeditors@gmail.com</a>.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Last week&#8217;s long-awaited, big-release comic was Kieron Gillen and Jamie McKelvie&#8217;s <strong>Young Avengers #1</strong>, a classic coming-of-age story about a group of 18-year-olds who just happen to be superheroes.</p>
<p>While many mainstream comics are still producing the kind of material that gets sent up on <a href="http://eschergirls.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Escher Girls</a> and <a href="http://thehawkeyeinitiative.com/" target="_blank">The Hawkeye Initiative</a>, Gillen and McKelvie actively reject the kind of objectification that gives the genre such a bad reputation amongst feminists. In contrast to the stereotypical tits-and-ass fare, the opening sequence of <strong>Young Avengers</strong> provides the reader with a three-page essay on the (straight/bi) female gaze. In a medium that overwhelmingly caters for straight male desires, this is a rare demonstration of how to do a sexy scene with decent gender politics.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2013/01/31/guest-post-young-avengers-1-sex-and-the-female-gaze/ya1/" rel="attachment wp-att-13060"><img data-attachment-id="13060" data-permalink="/2013/01/31/guest-post-young-avengers-1-sex-and-the-female-gaze/ya1/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/YA1.jpg?fit=1073%2C1665&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1073,1665" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="YA1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/YA1.jpg?fit=193%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/YA1.jpg?fit=659%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-13060 aligncenter" alt="YA1" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/YA1.jpg?resize=580%2C899" width="580" height="899" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/YA1.jpg?w=1073&amp;ssl=1 1073w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/YA1.jpg?resize=193%2C300&amp;ssl=1 193w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>On page one, Kate Bishop wakes up in an unfamiliar bed, having just hooked up with a man whose name she can&#8217;t quite remember. At this point anyone who&#8217;s familiar with comics, or popular culture in general, would expect to see some slut-shaming, or at least some titillating semi-nudity, but we get neither. Kate is dressed in a t-shirt which comes down to her mid-thigh, and it&#8217;s clear that she has no regrets, thinking: <em>For a second, some part of me thinks, “I should be ashamed.” I think that part of me is really stupid. </em></p>
<p>In the fourth panel we even see Kate smiling as she thinks back to the earlier part of her evening, and it&#8217;s the smile of someone who has just got laid and is pretty damned pleased with herself.<br />
The second page introduces us to Noh-Varr, whose bed Kate has woken up in, and this is where we see another convention subverted, because he&#8217;s the one in nothing but his underwear. In an interview with <a href="http://www.comicsalliance.com/2013/01/23/young-avengers-interview-kieron-gillen-jamie-mckelvie/#ixzz2IodBaUVn" target="_blank">Comics Alliance</a>, artist Jamie McKelvie explains the idea behind this scene:</p>
<blockquote><p>We&#8217;ve long had a problem in comics where the women are &#8220;sexy&#8221; (in a sexist fashion) and the men aren&#8217;t. Time to redress the balance. And there&#8217;s a big difference between sexist and sexy.</p></blockquote>

<p>Although male superheroes are usually drawn with extremely muscular physiques, it&#8217;s not normally sexualised in this way – the reader is supposed to want to <em>be</em> them, not have sex with them. This is a rare acknowledgement that people who fancy men read superhero comics too.</p>
<p>But rather than providing equality of objectification, the aim here is to have a sexy scene which enhances the story and doesn&#8217;t devalue either of the characters. If you&#8217;re enjoying the view of Noh-Varr in his underwear, it&#8217;s just a bonus, not the entire point of the sequence; if you&#8217;re not into it, his lack of clothes is incidental. As Gillen puts it in <a href="http://kierongillen.tumblr.com/post/40045596084/meet-the-team-marvel-boy" target="_blank">an introduction to the character of Noh-Varr</a> on his Tumblr:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;characters being sexy is cool but objectification in the process is bullshit. An inability to see the difference is a fundamental weakness. My wife’s in the next room watching Lord of the Rings, and I guarantee she’s thinking sexy thoughts about Aragorn. But that works without anything which annihilates him as a character, y’know?</p></blockquote>
<p>The reader is supposed to see this scene through Kate&#8217;s eyes, and as she watches Noh-Varr dancing around in his pants, it acknowledges the existence of the female gaze, both through Kate&#8217;s interest in watching him, and the <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice" target="_blank">fanservice</a> of the artwork.</p>
<p>Noh-Varr has a masculine appearance, but – perhaps because he&#8217;s an alien from another dimension – he doesn&#8217;t appear to be burdened with ideas of conventional masculinity, as we can see from his music choices. The comic&#8217;s title page states that the record he puts on is &#8216;Be My Baby&#8217; by the Ronettes (incidentally, this is the track played over the opening titles of the film <strong>Dirty Dancing</strong>, which is also about <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2013/01/09/guest-post-found-feminism-rewatching-dirty-dancing/">female sexual awakening</a>), and he talks about his enthusiasm for “close harmony girl groups” in a way that a heterosexual Earth man probably wouldn&#8217;t, because he&#8217;d be afraid of seeming effeminate. The play on gender roles is, of course, entirely deliberate, as one of the major influences in this version of the character is David Bowie during his androgynous, bisexual-identifying period in the early 1970s.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2013/01/31/guest-post-young-avengers-1-sex-and-the-female-gaze/ya3/" rel="attachment wp-att-13062"><img data-attachment-id="13062" data-permalink="/2013/01/31/guest-post-young-avengers-1-sex-and-the-female-gaze/ya3/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/YA3.jpg?fit=1043%2C1067&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1043,1067" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="YA3" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/YA3.jpg?fit=293%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/YA3.jpg?fit=1000%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-13062" alt="YA3" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/YA3.jpg?resize=526%2C538" width="526" height="538" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/YA3.jpg?w=1043&amp;ssl=1 1043w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/YA3.jpg?resize=293%2C300&amp;ssl=1 293w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/YA3.jpg?resize=1000%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 526px) 100vw, 526px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>As Kate watches Noh-Varr, the scene is interrupted by a Skrull attack (Skrulls are a species of warrior aliens that occasionally pop up in the Marvel Universe to attack either Earth or Noh-Varr&#8217;s species of warrior aliens). If this was a horror movie, this would be the moment where Kate&#8217;s decision to go back to Noh-Varr&#8217;s place for sexytimes gets her killed in a disgustingly graphic way, but rather than being punished for her naughty behaviour, Kate is rewarded with another adventure, when she pilots the space ship.</p>
<p>As well as understanding what many female fans want to see, Gillen also accepts that sometimes our appreciation goes beyond what&#8217;s on the page:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ever since our work on <a href="http://www.phonogramcomic.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Phonogram</strong></a>, Jamie have [sic] strove to make our comics – for want of a better phrase – <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_fiction" target="_blank">slash-fic</a>-able. If you’re working in certain heroic fantasy genres, that’s part of the emotional churn.</p>
<p>(taken from Gillen&#8217;s <a href="http://kierongillen.tumblr.com/post/40045596084/meet-the-team-marvel-boy" target="_blank">tumblr post on Noh-Varr</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>Recent comic book adaptation movies like <strong>Avengers Assemble</strong> and <strong>X-Men:First Class</strong> have been gleefully adopted by fanfiction writers, who find that the gender imbalances and close friendships between male characters give them plenty of material to work with. While slash has sometimes been treated as fandom&#8217;s dirty secret, Gillen and McKelvie are obviously quite comfortable with it. The title page even provides a nod to fangirl culture by adopting their language: editors Jake Thomas and Lauren Sankovitch are credited with “LOLs” and “feels” respectively – that&#8217;s “humour” and “emotions” to anyone who isn&#8217;t up-to-date on their internet memes.</p>
<p><strong>Young Avengers</strong> clearly demonstrates something which I&#8217;ve long suspected to be true: it really is possible for male writers to “get” female fans. Although there are female comics creators producing work that doesn&#8217;t make women cringe – even with big publishers like Marvel and DC – it doesn&#8217;t mean that their male colleagues should have a free pass to be obnoxiously sexist. We should be holding more men to the pro-feminist standard that Gillen and McKelvie have set, not just in comics, but in all forms of pop culture.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Team BadRep were put on the spot again this month: in the wake of <a href="http://dcwomenkickingass.tumblr.com/post/7985599811/panels">SDCC Batgirl</a> igniting the gender-and-comics conversation loud &#8216;n&#8217; proud, the team were asked to take a look at their favourite comic book titles and characters &#8211; some obvious choices, some less so&#8230; here&#8217;s Sarah C&#8217;s take.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Ah, comics. Or <em>graphic novels</em>, if they are trying to seduce me across a pseudy coffee bar in Edinburgh, which they did &#8211; more on that later.</p>
<p>Dear reader, this is a tale of a long, passionate, but fractious love affair.</p>
<p>It started early. I noticed them, but they never seemed to be the right one for me, stocked as they were in the &#8220;boys&#8217; section&#8221; of the magazine racks. I kept myself busy with the garish colours of the (probably) gender neutral <a href="http://www.dandy.com/"><strong>Dandy</strong></a> and the <a href="http://www.beano.com/"><strong>Beano</strong></a>. Whilst being amused but ultimately concerned by the levels of naughtiness from <a href="http://www.beano.com/characters/minnie-the-minx">Minnie the Minx</a> (I was a very conscientious child), I found myself captured by a few sections from the pages of hand-me-down copies of the now-defunct &#8220;girls&#8217; own&#8221; annual <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunty"><strong>Bunty</strong></a>. Looking back on it, the artwork was poor and the storylines were hammy with a sprinkling of schmaltz, but some stood out: tales of mystery, adventure, aliens and heroines were hidden amidst the pages of dreary &#8220;girl stuff&#8221;. Now we&#8217;re talking!</p>

<p>Flash forward, and I&#8217;m at university in Edinburgh with actual money in my pocket. I&#8217;ve caught flickers of images in such hallowed sanctuaries as <a href="http://forbiddenplanet.com/">Forbidden Planet</a>, which is exciting but mostly full of plastic models. <a href="http://www.deadheadcomics.co.uk/">Deadhead</a>, lurking on the crooked medieval road across from the pub where I&#8217;ve just earned my actual money, is poky and rammed with paper; pleasingly reminiscment in layout and smell of old bookshops.</p>
<p>On the shelves I spot a beautifully painted (thank you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_Fegredo">Duncan Fegredo</a>) issue of Mike Carey&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer_%28DC_Comics%29"><strong>Lucifer</strong></a>, where a winged schoolgirl escapes the giant maw of a fiery demon; the first of the new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catwoman"><strong>Catwoman</strong></a> where Selina Kyle is resplendent and powerful in a jumpsuit and combat boots; and the gothic lusciousness of Serena Valentino&#8217;s  <a href="http://serenavalentino.com/gloomcookie/"><strong>GloomCookie</strong></a>. <em>And that was just the covers!</em></p>

<p>The stories, oh, oh, oh the stories. Magical, fantastical, intricate and complex tales of all kinds with interesting and varied female characters being just as magical, just as fantastically intricate and complex as their male counterparts.</p>
<p>I am doing my level best to just not list all of them because that would be a little tedious &#8211; check the Wiki articles or better yet come round and read them &#8211; my point is that they were there, and they were<em> so far</em> removed from any other female heroes (or anti-heroes, or villains) that I had ever seen before, and there were just SO MANY of them.</p>
<p>Over the next many years I spent a lot of time and money on comics. I was in love.  Besotted. I compulsively collected every issue of the jaw-dropping <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fables_%28comics%29"><strong>Fables</strong></a> and <a href="http://www.dccomics.com/vertigo/graphic_novels/?gn=1736"><strong>Y: The Last Man</strong></a> (a must for any comic collection). As I tend to be when in love, I was somewhat obsessed. I wrote my dissertation on postmodernist structuralism in Grant Morrison&#8217;s <a href="http://www.barbelith.com/bomb/"><strong>The Invisibles</strong></a> (I know better now, it should have been postmodern superhero archetypes in <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Doom_Patrol:_Crawling_from_the_Wreckage"><strong>Doom Patrol</strong></a>).</p>
<p>I found the most perfect fairy tale ever told in the form of Jeff Smith&#8217;s independent offering <a href="http://www.boneville.com/"><strong>Bone</strong></a>. This is an epic adventure of derring do, lost princesses who need to save the kingdom, war, friendship, quiche and dragons. I cannot recommend it enough.<br />

<p>The character of Grandma Ben blasts away so many female stereotypes. She is mysterious, strong, forthright, takes no nonsense and just plain funny.  She also races cows. As in, races against them. I aim to also do this when I am her age (which she refuses to tell anyone, of course).</p>
<p>But as I read my way through everything that caught my eye, I was spotting a change.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Transmetropolitan_characters#Yelena_Rossini">Filthy Assistant number two</a> Yelena Rossini romped her way through Warren Ellis&#8217; <strong>Transmetropolitan</strong> and stole my heart somewhat with her hard smoking, futuristic gumshoe gonzo journalism and attack womb. Zee Hernandez from Brian Wood&#8217;s spectacular <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMZ_%28comics%29"><strong>DMZ</strong></a> played Beatrice to the lost photographer and guided both him and the reader through a ghastly vision of New York as the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>These women were still good, still interesting, but they were second fiddle, playing traditional (albeit revamped and turbo-boosted) support roles such as healers and helpmeets whilst also filling the &#8220;minority quota&#8221;, especially in the case of Zee who is both non-white and non-male. Naturally all of them end up sleeping with or as love interests for the male protagonists, although at least the storylines of those titles made up for the stereotypes.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the way, it started to go wrong. Bit by bit by bit, even these characters faded away. The series that I loved ended (I cried at the end of <strong>Lucifer</strong>) and were replaced with weaker, less interesting versions. Costumes became smaller, boobs bigger. I started my &#8220;never buy a comic where the cover art has a woman with breasts bigger than her head&#8221; campaign, and found myself wealthier but with a<em> lot less</em> comics.</p>
<p>Female characters and their stories became less widely available. There were still some bright sparks but these were increasingly ghettoised in the narrow &#8220;independent&#8221; section of the store or as part of autobiographical works such as the excellent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persepolis_%28comics%29"><strong>Persepolis</strong></a>. The lack of new work meant that shops began pushing long-standing books like <a href="http://www.strangersinparadise.com/"><strong>Strangers in Paradise</strong></a> or reprints of classics  obviously aimed at women such as <a href="http://dykestowatchoutfor.com/"><strong>Dykes to Watch Out For</strong></a>.</p>
<p>There were still good stories in comic book world, with great artwork, but the women I had come to love had gone missing from the mainstream. Titles such as <strong>Wonder Woman</strong> or <strong>Lady Death</strong> looked like bad pornography, and the artwork for some of my favourite writers became downright ridiculous to the point of offensive. My relationship with comics was getting rocky.</p>
<p>I can pinpoint the exact moment that caused us to break up. It was <a href="http://www.ignitioncity.com/"><strong>Ignition City</strong></a> by Warren Ellis, specifically the way that almost every page had a massive pair of tits or tight (female) bottom in it, regardless of whether that was particularly appropriate or relevant. The male characters, of course, could be as fat, wrinkly, gross, old, multicultural and multidimensional as actual people. The female characters only existed to ensure that there were toned body parts for the consumption of the reader (who obviously wasn&#8217;t meant to be me).</p>
<p>What happened to my love?  What changed? I don&#8217;t know. I have moved to pastures new &#8211; online comics such as <a href="http://www.freakangels.com/"><strong>Freak Angels</strong></a>, <a href="http://www.girlgeniusonline.com/"><strong>Girl Genius</strong></a>, <a href="http://www.sinfest.net/"><strong>Sinfest</strong></a> and <a href="http://xkcd.com/"><strong>XKCD</strong></a> fulfill my panel-related addiction, but every now and then I look longingly at my groaning bookshelf with all those beautiful trade paperbacks, wondering when, if ever, there might be a return to form.</p>
<p>Come back, baby. I miss you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was very worried about this film, having watched <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHBnrJowBZE">the trailer</a> and become fearful that it might go the way of the <strong>Hulk</strong> franchise. It had a similar feel to it &#8211; lots of rippling muscles and anger with cars being thrown around.</p>
<p>I am pleased to say that I was wrong. And <strong>Thor</strong> is, in fact, awesome. In all ways. Although especially in the way that <strong>Chris Hemsworth</strong> is jaw-droppingly attractive and takes his shirt off for extended periods. Also his biceps appear to be gearing up to eat Tokyo. And there&#8217;s <em>mud wrestling</em>.</p>

<p>Now, when I tell you the plot you&#8217;ll tell me that I have gone mad for liking it, and that I was blinded by the sight of such a perfect male specimen. In my defence, this is an actor cast to play Thor, so he needs to be at least a bit buff.</p>
<p>Bear with me.</p>
<p>The<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesir"> Aesir</a> here are basically alien-space royalty and live on this beautiful world with crystal palaces and epic science/magic. The rainbow bridge (guarded by Heimdall, played by the brilliant-in-everything <strong>Idris Elba</strong>) allows them to blast their way to other planets. Using the argument that any sufficiently advanced science is indistinguishable from magic, they are worshipped as gods by the primitive Vikings.</p>
<p>Thus when a chap falls to earth (landing in a small town somewhere in the sandy <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=square+states">square states</a>) and proclaims himself Thor, everyone thinks he&#8217;s a bit mad. Especially when the rampaging starts. However, some handy scientists need him for some handy science, and then there&#8217;s this hammer that no-one can lift&#8230;</p>
<p>This all had the potential to be cringingly awful and cheesy, but fortunately it was handled in a rarely-seen triumphal triumvirate of sensitive and nuanced acting, balanced direction (<strong>Kenneth Branagh</strong> at the helm, and he&#8217;s a man who can deal with a lot of ham) and a script that focused on that shyest of all beasts in the comic book action genre: character development.</p>
<div id="attachment_5196" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Thor.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5196" data-attachment-id="5196" data-permalink="/2011/05/10/at-the-movies-thor/thor/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Thor.jpg?fit=440%2C358&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="440,358" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Thor" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Thor.jpg?fit=300%2C244&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Thor.jpg?fit=440%2C358&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-5196" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Thor-300x244.jpg?resize=300%2C244" alt="Image from Mark Millar's Thor comics.

<p>That&#8217;s right. Character development. Get in.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Hopkins</strong>, who plays Odin, is <a href="http://splashpage.mtv.com/2010/02/09/exclusive-anthony-hopkins-talks-thor-says-thou-shalt-not-hear-shakespearean-talk/">seen here in an interview</a> calling Thor &#8220;a superhero film with a bit of Shakespeare in&#8221;, which is a good summary. The almost unbelieveable plot is rescued from itself by the way in which it allows characters to grow.</p>
<p>I was very happy that the writers had chosen to riff heavily from <strong>Mark Millar</strong>&#8216;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Thor"><strong>Ultimate Thor</strong></a> rewrites, in which Thor is styled as a hero struggling with self-doubt and the agony of everyone thinking that he&#8217;s actually suffering from delusions that make him think he&#8217;s a god.</p>
<p>In the film, Thor gets kicked out of Valhalla by Odin for being an annoying, spoilt teenager who picks fights and starts wars. He needs to make good and get some responsibility.</p>
<p>We follow Thor on his journey from arrogant, angry young man to being, well, a grown up. His essential good-naturedness and charm, as well as obvious desire to do good, make this neither pat nor schmaltzy, but wholly believable, and at times exceptionally moving.</p>
<p>In the meantime, his brother Loki is also trying to find himself. Rather than the standard trope of being evil because he&#8217;s a villain (although he is of course played by an English actor), the whole thing is carried off with depth, subtlety and aplomb by <strong>Tom Hiddleston</strong>.</p>
<p>Like Thor, Loki grows into himself, and it is only at the end that he makes  the transition from a young warrior of potential into someone capable of  evil. You know, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0121766/">the thing that George Lucas tried to do with the backstory for that guy in the black armour</a>, but ended up just embarrassing everyone?</p>
<p>I bet <strong>Natalie Portman</strong> (playing handy scientist Jane Foster) was glad to get that storyline right this time.</p>
<p>Speaking of Natalie Portman, let&#8217;s have a look at the female characters. They are admittedly thin on the ground, but those that are there are pretty good. Portman and <strong>Kat Dennings</strong> (playing Darcy) give good scientist and political scientist respectively, with the Jane Foster character updated from nurse to physicist.  Both women avoid the dull stereotype of being either predictably &#8220;spirited&#8221; or annoyingly wet. </p>

Fact.</p></div>
<p>The kickass <strong>Jaime Alexander</strong> plays Sif (Thor&#8217;s wife in the mythology, but we&#8217;ll leave that for the sequel, I suppose), heads up Team Junior Aesir in their fight to rescue Thor from Earth, and gets as much, if not more, fighting screen time as the rest of them.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s also wearing a costume that looks appropriate to fighting in, which is a personal bugbear of mine. No-one can fight crime in a bustier. No-one. Pay attention, people allegedly, eventually, making <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Woman#Live-action_film"><strong>Wonder Woman</strong></a>. I said <em>no-one.</em></p>
<p>There&#8217;s also some ice giants in it, but realistically the action element plays second fiddle to the storyline, and although there were a lot of fighting sequences my overall impressions of the film were about people and personalities rather than a barrage of things crashing into other things.</p>
<p>Which is no bad thing. I love action films, but I love them even more if there&#8217;s more to them than just action (are you listening, <strong>Michael Bay</strong>?)</p>
<p>And the action wasn&#8217;t exactly light on the ground &#8211; there were some very pleasing fights on all realms of reality from soldiers to robots to lots of ice giants getting hit in the face. A personal favourite caused me to turn and hi-five the person next to me (fortunately, Miranda, and not a stranger) because Thor had just smashed his hammer into the face of an enormous ice-beast and SAVED THE DAY in epic hero style.</p>
<p><strong>YOU SHOULD SEE THIS FILM BECAUSE:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You like comic book adaptations or action films</li>
<li>It has an amazing cast acting their socks off</li>
<li>You want to see how EPIC Norse Gods can be whether they are good or evil</li>
<li>You want to sing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCvMKcNJCAY">this song over and over</a> in your head when you&#8217;ve left the cinema</li>
<li>Just go and see it already!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>YOU SHOULD NOT SEE THIS FILM BECAUSE:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You are allergic to bling, muscles, fighting, deep voices or CGI ice giants.</li>
<li>You realise that they didn&#8217;t put Fenris Wolf in, OR cast Brian Blessed as Odin, and that makes you a bit sad.</li>
</ul>
