<p>Fantastic artist <A href="http://egypt.urnash.com/about.html"><strong>Egypt Urnash</strong></a> drew this for free, as a &#8220;t-shirt design for a college SF club&#8221;. It was then linked to by Major Internet Deity <A href="http://www.warrenellis.com/?p=12739">Warren Ellis</a>, who knows groovy stuff when he sees it, and subsequently the design is now selling as <A href="http://www.deviantart.com/print/19408301/?">framed art prints</a> and <A href="http://www.redbubble.com/people/egypturnash/t-shirts/7176075-what-science-fiction-means-to-me">t-shirts</a>.</p>
<p>Why do I love this so much?</p>
<p>Possibly because it could have been titled &#8220;What I want to be when I grow up&#8221; (and still apply to me and most of Team BadRep now, if we&#8217;re honest). It has a shark with a frickin&#8217; laser on its head, which is always good for +10 points, but it&#8217;s got to be the sheer joy on the girl&#8217;s face. I think I just have an innate love of anything which could legitimately have the caption &#8220;YEAH BABY, YEAH!&#8221;</p>
<p>At a time when <a href="http://asknicola.blogspot.com/2011/05/shocking-uk-sf-favourites-score-men-500.html">women seem to be shockingly under-represented in Sci-fi</a> (way beyond the ratio of actual female authors to male) and <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/booksblog/2011/may/31/women-science-fiction-writers">hearty debate on whether that&#8217;s because of sexism or other factors</a>, I&#8217;m delighted at anything which tells young women they have a central place in SF. (The first link references Joanna Russ&#8217; &#8220;How to suppress women&#8217;s writing&#8221;, which <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/05/10/joanna-russ-1937-2011/" />we mentioned ourselves recently</a>.) </p>
<p>Women of all ages <em>should</em> be holding the rayguns and riding the space-sharks, dammit. After all, <a href="http://www.wiscon.info/" />WisCon</a> (&#8216;the World&#8217;s leading feminist science fiction convention&#8217;) has just finished, and once again shows the potential of the genre not only to excite and speak to everyone, but to be a blank slate where <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/10/26/laser-guns-can-save-us-from-the-anti-pc-brigade/" />current prejudices don&#8217;t have to be brought along</a>. SF could be a feminist&#8217;s best friend.</p>
<p><A href="http://egypt.urnash.com">Egypt&#8217;s site here</a> contains the <a href="http://egypt.urnash.com/Illustration/shark-sf">full-size original</a>, as well as other Awesome Art which you should go and look at.</p>
