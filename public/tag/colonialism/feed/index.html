<h2 style="text-align: center;">TEA</h2>
<blockquote><p>Make tea, child, said my kind mamma. Sit by me, love, and make tea.</p>
<p>Samuel Richardson, <strong>Clarissa </strong>(1747)</p></blockquote>
<p>Ah, the Joke Post comes upon us at last. T is for &#8216;t&#8217;&#8230; very droll. I lift a cup to that. But fie! Have we learned nothing on this lexical journey? First and foremost, <em>tea </em>was not always pronounced as we currently say it: when it first appeared in English in 1601 it was <em>&#8216;taaaaay</em>&#8216; and often written <em>tay </em>(like the modern French <em>thé</em>, a bit). It is not quite clear when and why the shift to &#8216;ti&#8217; happened, but, then, few things are as easy to lose sight of as pronunciation (how many people remember that Keats was a Cockney?)</p>

<p><em>Tea</em>, of course, has the additional complication that it is not an English word (although what is?) – it came from the Dutch <em>thee</em>, in turn from Malay and, eventually, Chinese Amoy dialect: <em>t&#8217;e</em>, or the Mandarin <em>ch&#8217;a. </em>Woven into the geographical etymology, then, is a legacy of import history: around the mid-seventeenth century we procured our tea from the Dutch, who imported it from Malaysia and, ultimately, China. What exactly were they importing? Why, <em>tea</em>&#8216;s first definition, of course: &#8216;the leaves of the tea-plant, usually in a dried and prepared state for making the drink&#8217;. In this form,<em> tea</em> began with a queen, and quickly became every eighteenth-century Cosmo girl&#8217;s first route of seduction.</p>
<h3>Brew and Thunder.</h3>
<p>But first &#8211; the drink. &#8216;Made by infusing these leaves in boiling water, having a somewhat bitter and aromatic flavour, and acting as a moderate stimulant&#8217; &#8211; in this sense, the word <em>tea </em>is first recorded around 1601, so some trendsetters must have been aware of it before the widespread importing of the later seventeenth century, when <em>tea </em>really came into its own: Samuel Pepys tried it in 1660, and a couple of years later it found a celebrity backer in the <a href="http://www.oceansbridge.com/paintings/museums/national-portrait-gallery/Catherine-of-Braganza.jpg">be-farthingaled</a> shape of the Portuguese queen consort to Charles II, Catherine of Braganza (<a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/01/10/an-alphabet-of-femininism-13-m-is-for-marriage/">remember her</a>?). So, in England at least, <em>tea </em>was from the beginning tending towards the female of the species.</p>
<p>Catherine&#8217;s tea-drinking was partly to do with Portugal&#8217;s colonial links with Asia, but also with her <a href="http://www.britannia.com/history/biographies/catherine_braganza.html">temperament</a>: solemn and pious, she initially had trouble fitting into the Protestant English court and her preference for a &#8216;moderate stimulant&#8217; over the ales and beers otherwise drunk marked one of many departures. But <em>tea </em>was quickly owning its stimulating qualities and being marketed as a &#8216;tonic&#8217;, a civilized alternative to alcohol capable of soothing aches&#8217;n&#8217;pains and spurring on mental capacities: a zeitgeist for the intellectual impetus of the early Enlightenment &#8211; as against Charles II&#8217;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2kyNbZc7oc">well-known debauchery</a> &#8211; and, in fact, a &#8216;<a href="http://hunch.com/asterix-characters/falbala-panacea/2760474/">panacea</a>&#8216;:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hail, Queen of Plants, Pride of <strong>Elysian </strong>Bow&#8217;rs!<br />
How shall we speak thy complicated Powr&#8217;s?<br />
Thou wondrous <strong>Panacea</strong>, to asswage<br />
The Calentures of Youth&#8217;s fermenting rage,<br />
And animate the freezing veins of age.</p>
<p>Nahum Tate, from <strong>Panacea: A Poem Upon Tea </strong>(1700)</p></blockquote>
<p>But what started out as a Portuguese import became a matter of English national identity, and by the next century London&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company">East India Company </a>had established a monopoly on trade, controlling imports into Britain (and thus, prices), using its extensive trade links with Queen Catherine&#8217;s dowry –then-Bombay – and the East Indies, and Asia. It was thus that the English turned not into a nation of coffee drinkers, but to devotees of the &#8216;Queen of Plants&#8217;. And a queen she certainly was, and not entirely distinct from the maternal and oft-secluded <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne,_Queen_of_Great_Britain">Queen Anne</a>, who dramatically reduced the size of the English court and inspired a new fashion for calm domesticity and politeness. Thus, the bustling male-dominated <a href="http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd's_of_London#Formation">coffee-houses</a>, but also a more feminine fix at home&#8230;</p>
<h3>Five Leaves Left.</h3>
<p>So in 1738 <em>tea </em>came to mean not just some withered leaf, but also an opportunity for socialising! Hurrah! To be precise, <em>tea </em>became &#8216;a meal or social entertainment at which tea is served; especially an ordinary afternoon or evening meal, at which the usual beverage is tea&#8217;. The fact that it could connote an &#8216;ordinary afternoon meal&#8217; made <em>tea </em>a convenient beverage to offer casual social callers, although it was also, of course, a beverage that demanded a whole host of conspicuous purchases: a full tea-set and the crucial Other Element – sugar. Thus your tea-table represented Britain&#8217;s colonial interests off in China and India to the tea-side, and Africa and the East Indies to the sugar-side, with all the attendant horrors of the emergent slave trade conveniently swept under the (Persian) rug.</p>

Photo par Hodge.</p></div>
<p>The conspicuous consumption <em>tea </em>represented was exacerbated by its price: before mass importation in the mid-century had driven costs down, the leaf itself was fixed at so extortionate a price (a bargain in 1680 was 30s a pound) as to necessitate the purchase of a lockable tea-chest, which would become the responsibility first of the lady of the house, and, when age-appropriate, of her daughter. The woman who held the key to the tea-chest was, naturally, also the woman who made the tea &#8211; thus &#8216;Shall I be mother?&#8217;, a phrase of uncertain origin. One theory I came across was that it is a Victorian idiom related to the phenomenon of women unable to breastfeed naturally using teapot spouts to convey milk to their infant instead. OH THE SYMBOLISM.</p>
<p>Whatever the phrase&#8217;s specific origins, it&#8217;s certainly true that from <em>tea</em>&#8216;s domestic beginnings onwards whole family power structures could hang on which woman this &#8216;mother&#8217; was. Alas, London&#8217;s major galleries forbid image reproduction (WAAH), but if you turn to <a href="http://images.npg.org.uk/790_500/9/2/mw08292.jpg">your handouts</a>,  you will see this in action. This is the Tyers family: that&#8217;s Mr Tyers on the left, and his son just down from one of the universities. His daughter, on the far right, is about to be married (she&#8217;s putting her gloves on to go out &#8211; out of the door and out of the family). Her role as tea-maker has, in consequence, passed onto her younger sister, who now sits as squarely in the middle of the family portrait as she does in the family sphere. Conversely, in <strong>Clarissa</strong>, when the heroine angers her parents they sack her from her tea-task and grotesquely divide it up among other family members (&#8220;My heart was up at my mouth. I did not know what to do with myself&#8221;, she recalls, distraught. I WANTED TO MAKE TEA!).</p>
<h3>And she feeds you tea and oranges&#8230;</h3>
<p>Of course, while assigning the tea-making to your daughter could be a loving gesture of trust, it also pimped her marriageability: it requires a cool head and calm demeanour to remember five-plus milk&#8217;n&#8217;sugar preferences, judge the strength of the tea and pour it, all the while making small-talk and remaining attentive to your guests. Add to this the weighty responsibility of locking the tea away from thieving servants and you have the management skills of housewifery in miniature. It also showed off physical charms: poise, posture, the elegant turn of a wrist, a beautifully framed bosom. To take this momentarily out of the salon, no respectable punter would get down in an eighteenth-century brothel without first taking tea with the girls: <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanny_Hill">Fanny Hill</a> </strong>spends at least as much time drinking tea as (<em>That&#8217;s enough – Ed</em>), and, of course, this kind of performative tea-ritual femininity is a mainstay in the professional life of the Japanese <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geisha">geisha</a>.</p>
<p>So, along with its identity as a colonial mainstay in Britain&#8217;s trading life, <em>tea </em>in its origins is also something specifically feminine: a kind of Muse inspiring intellectual greatness, a Queen to be worshipped as a symbol of Britain&#8217;s health and power, and a key element in the women&#8217;s domestic lives. It could be stimulating, relaxing and seductive, but,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Tea_Party"> as would become disastrously clear</a>, it was always political.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">NANNY</h2>
<h3><strong>Sonic Nurse</strong></h3>
<p>After the army of Important Academic Languages, and their Distinguished And Layered Relationship With Modern English, we reach this. <em>N</em><em>anny </em>has no real relation to Latin, Greek, French, Middle or even Old English, but derives from &#8216;a child&#8217;s corruption of the word <em>nurse</em>&#8216;, tellingly akin to <em>mamma</em>. <em>Nurse</em>, it must be granted,<em> </em>has slightly more pedigree: it derives from the twelfth-century Old French term <em>norrice</em>,<em> </em>via the Latin <em>nutricius </em>(=<em> </em>&#8216;that suckles, nourishes&#8217;). It<em> </em>first appears in 1530 as a verb &#8216;to suckle&#8217;, and as a noun fifty years later, where it has the meaning we probably use most often: &#8216;one who takes care of the sick&#8217;.</p>

<p><em>Nanny</em> is first cited as an independent word meaning &#8216;a child&#8217;s nurse-maid&#8217; in 1795, whence it proves itself as fluid as you would expect, also encompassing a quasi-proper name, <em>Nana</em> (Cf. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUhwA-C-ACg">Katy Nana</a> in <strong>Mary Poppins</strong>, and the Newfoundland dog in <strong>Peter Pan</strong>). In 1830s America, we meet another deviant form of the same idea: <em>mammy,</em> a dialect corruption of <em>mamma</em> referring to &#8216;a black woman who looks after white children&#8217;. In extended form, <em>mammy </em>refers to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammy_archetype">racial stereotype</a>: &#8216;the loud, overweight and good natured black woman&#8217;, epitomised (in proper name form) in <strong>Gone With The Wind</strong>, and controversially brought to life in an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92kLpKuRJfo">Oscar-winning performance</a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hattie_McDaniel">Hattie McDaniel</a> (above, right). And it&#8217;s not all the Americans: this phenomenon has certain similarities to the British use of native women as nursemaids in colonial India, <em>ayah</em>s, so named in reference to the Hindi word meaning &#8216;nurse&#8217;.</p>
<h3>Dude Ranch Nurse</h3>
<p>All this leads back to one place: the whistleblowing potential of an <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/11/29/an-alphabet-of-femininism-9-i-is-for-infant/">infant&#8217;s cries</a>, in this instance naming the truly maternal figure in their formative years. But then, of course, until the late eighteenth century (the nineteenth, in France), no fashionable woman would even consider nursing her own child: on the contrary, <em>wet nursing </em>(sending your kid out to be suckled by a hired breast) was so common as to be automatic. Newborns were generally sent away for up to two years to be <em>nourished</em>, at a rate of anything from a few shillings a week to between £25 &#8211; 50 a year.</p>
<p>The reasons were as varied as the price, spanning the apparently trivial (social custom, and the desire to return to public life ASAP); the medical (fears for the mother&#8217;s health after the strain of lying in <em>sans </em>twenty-first century advantages), and the &#8216;medical&#8217; (the widespread notion that sex with a nursing woman would damage her milk and therefore the child, and the belief that conception was impossible during this time anyway). It also seems possible that rampant infant mortality may have contributed: parents would send their children away until they had survived their most dangerous years, rather than invest emotional energy in a little&#8217;un who might well leave you before their first birthday.</p>
<p>That said, the enduring influence of the nanny <em>qua</em> mother-figure lasted long into the twentieth century, albeit mostly among the mega-aristocracy: <strong>The King&#8217;s Speech </strong>(2011) imagines the future George VI to have been closer to his nannies than his family; one of these, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Bill">Charlotte Bill</a>, was famously also an effective mother to his autistic and epileptic younger brother, Johnny (re-created in the 2003 BBC serial <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lost_Prince">The Lost Prince</a></strong>).</p>

<p>The women who actually did all this nursing were inevitably of a lower social class than their clients – if not a different race – although they could earn good money (and possibly a nice pension) in the process. Here we tumble into a parallel nanny universe: the word in its more formal sense originating from another <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/10/25/an-alphabet-of-femininism-4-d-is-for-doll/">proper name</a><em>. </em>Through a bit of shuffling, good old <em>Ann</em> became first <em>Nan</em> and then <em>Nanny</em>, in which incarnation, around 1788, the word came to simply connote femininity, as in <em>Nanny-goat </em>(= &#8216;a female goat&#8217;, on which see also &#8216;Jenny Wren&#8217; and &#8216;jenny-ass&#8217;). Like <em>Doll</em>, Nan&#8217;s trajectory suggests commonness, generic feminine identity, and while the dictionary is specific on the two <em>nannies</em>&#8216; separation, its stated origin in an infant&#8217;s mouth is by definition uncertain, language development fluid, and the connections between milking and the farmyard in need of little exposition – compare the nineteenth-century term <em>baby farmer</em>, a lower-class wet nurse happy to let her charges die because her one-off fee encouraged little else. The term was always pejorative, and synonymous with the dangerous, non-nurturing female.</p>
<p>In contrast, we have the <em>nannies </em>who stayed with one family for generations (like the <em>mammy</em> and the <em>ayah </em>abroad): these last are inevitably conventionally &#8216;older&#8217; than their baby-farming colleagues, and presumably played a more extended mothering role. It is these strange insider-outsiders who appear in literature as bawdy and decrepit old women, inevitably depicted as their job title suggests: firmly on the side of the children they raise, to the extent that they will happily aid their improper sexual dalliances. It is thus that the <em>Nurse</em> appears in <strong>Romeo and Juliet</strong>, and in Keats&#8217; <strong>The Eve of St. Agnes</strong>. The suspicion inevitably directed at these figures is certainly class-based: wet nursing&#8217;s detractors had been arguing for years that by withholding mothers&#8217; milk parents risked their children absorbing working-class mannerisms – and criminal tendencies – from their surrogate teats.</p>
<h3>Na na na na na.</h3>
<p>The next stop for the <em>nanny </em>is in the inter-war years, with representatives including P.L. Travers&#8217; <strong>Mary Poppins</strong>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Now_We_Are_Six">poems </a>of A. A. Milne, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noel_Streatfeild">Noel Streatfeild</a>&#8216;s legion of sexless &#8216;cottage loaf&#8217; Nanas. Streatfeild&#8217;s children are almost invariably orphaned, and their Nana-figure keeps them nourished through &#8216;nursery ways&#8217;, a stubborn lack of sentimentality, and a feeling of permanence sadly lacking in the increasingly fragmented world of war-torn Britain. A similar idea is repeated in the 1964 Disney film of Travers&#8217; novel, which makes the significant decision to backdate events to 1910, when the focus is on &#8216;moulding the breed&#8217; for future colonial greatness:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIamxYhVfnI">A British nanny must be a general! </a><br />
The future empire lies within her hands.<br />
And so the person that we need<br />
To mould the breed<br />
Is a nanny who can give commands!</p>
<p>Walt Disney&#8217;s <strong>Mary Poppins </strong>(1964)</p></blockquote>
<p>In so doing, Disney&#8217;s film situates the<em> nanny </em>as part of &#8216;tradition, discipline and rules&#8217;, nurturing Britain&#8217;s future rather than its children, and flying in the face of its very etymology.</p>
<p>Mr Banks&#8217; song does, however, lead us to the final stop on <em>nanny&#8217;</em>s childishly simple word-journey: its modern incarnation as the Dreaded <em>Nanny State </em>(first appearing some time between the fifties and sixties). Always an opprobrious term (<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4044815.stm">attempts to re-appropriate it</a> have met with derision)  critics of government intervention ranging from the welfare state to the smoking ban hark back to the <em>nanny </em>to point up &#8216;mollycoddling&#8217;, the infantalisation of the people (who are presumably thus reduced to the baby-talk of the nursery) returning to <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=F3vwrJQWukUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false">childhood with a fussy female at the helm</a>. Wash your face, dearie.</p>
