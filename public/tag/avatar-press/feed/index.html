										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, here are three recent-ish comics, one good, one with potential but some issues, and one of them so eye-meltingly bad that quite possibly I am a worse person for having read it.</p>
<p>So, let’s start with the bad, because that’s where the fun is, right? Right.</p>
<h3><em>Neonomicon</em> – Alan Moore</h3>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/neonomicon.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="5770" data-permalink="/2011/05/31/yes-maybe-no-three-comics/neonomicon/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/neonomicon.jpg?fit=662%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="662,1024" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="neonomicon cover" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/neonomicon.jpg?fit=193%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/neonomicon.jpg?fit=662%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5770" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/neonomicon-193x300.jpg?resize=193%2C300" alt="Cover of issue 1 of Alan Moore's comic series Neonomicon.

<p>A four part mini-series that wrapped up just recently, <strong>Neonomicon</strong> was… well, it was, as much as we might wish it hadn’t been. A modern spin on Lovecraft’s Cthulu Mythos, <strong>Neonomicon</strong> actually looked like it had potential to start with. A good Mythos tale lures you in with mundane normality and then – bam! – unspeakable eldritch abomination and the creeping madness behind your eyes. In a similar way, <strong>Neonomicon</strong> lures you in with a clever enough idea and characters and then – bam! – racism and gang rape. We’ll get to that in a moment.</p>
<p>So, that acceptable start we mentioned. We’re given a pair of FBI agents investigating some strange goings on that very quickly become Mythos related. And hey, we think, the two lead characters are not square jawed white guys. We’ve got a female lead and a black male lead, nice to see some variety in character design for a change. Sure, some of the Lovecraft references are a bit heavy handed, but that’s okay.</p>
<p>And then the second issue happens. Our two agents have followed the lead to a Mythos sex shop in a quiet New England town. It’s not sure whether it wants to be creepy or played for laughs with some of the novelty items visible in the background. One thing leads to another, and they’re infiltrating a sex cult and… oh, now the guy has been shot, and the racial slurs are flowing freely. And now it’s gang rape time for the female agent. Thanks for that, Alan Moore.</p>
<p>Now, Moore did say (there&#8217;s a quote in <a href="http://www.theskinny.co.uk/article/100258-choose-your-reality-alan-moore-unearthed">this interview here</a>) that when he was writing this he thought (paraphrased): “&#8230;let’s put all of the unpleasant racial stuff back in, let’s put sex back in.”  And that could have been interesting, handled differently. It could have been a chance to tackle some of the issues with Lovecraft, to look at the fact that Lovecraft was a bit of a terrible racist and misogynist. But that isn’t what happens here. This isn’t a story that uses sex and racism to raise questions and make a point. It’s just a story full of non-consensual sex and racism. Or, as a friend put it: &#8220;If God were to look down upon this benighted planet in judgement, he’d probably think the place worthy of a second chance. Until he read<strong> Neonomicon</strong>. Then he’d remember why he commissioned the Book of Revelation in the first place.&#8221;</p>
<h3><em>Carbon Grey</em> – Hoan Nguyen</h3>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/550w_comics_carbon_grey.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="5771" data-permalink="/2011/05/31/yes-maybe-no-three-comics/550w_comics_carbon_grey/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/550w_comics_carbon_grey.jpg?fit=550%2C825&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="550,825" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Carbon Grey Cover" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/550w_comics_carbon_grey.jpg?fit=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/550w_comics_carbon_grey.jpg?fit=550%2C825&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5771" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/550w_comics_carbon_grey-200x300.jpg?resize=200%2C300" alt="Cover of issue 1 of Hoan Nguyen's comic Carbon Grey.

<p><strong>Carbon Grey</strong> is our “has potential, but also issues”. Let’s look at the potential first.</p>
<p>Set in a slightly steampunky spin on First World War-era Europe, the story follows the Sisters Grey. Each generation, we’re told, see three sisters born to the Grey family, hereditary defenders of the Kaiser. Three sisters, one for strength, one for grace, one for wisdom. Except in this generation, where the youngest sister has a twin, a fourth Grey, a sister for revolution.</p>
<p>What does this get us? It gets us explosions, and action, and the four very deadly Sisters Grey kicking ass and changing the face of politics in Mitteleuropa. It gets us spies and assassins and clever dialogue. And did I mention the ass-kicking? In the opening sequence of the first issue the youngest Grey pulls off more awesome action stuff than can be found in an entire <strong>Die Hard</strong> marathon.</p>
<p>The issues, then? Well, mostly it revolves around one thing: the art (which for the most part is very, very pretty, as long as you don’t mind the manga influences). With one notable exception in the form of a background character with no lines, all the female characters have essentially the same body type. It’s that improbable superhero-woman build, all gravity defying breasts and waist lines that surely don’t leave enough room for internal organs. The Queen of Germany lounges around in a scrap of white fabric that’d make Emma Frost blush.</p>
<p>The intro arc has just wrapped up, so now’s a good time to get in on the main story of Carbon Grey, if you can look past the art problems.</p>
<p>And now, on to the good.</p>
<h3><em>Scarlet</em> – Brian Michael Bendis</h3>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/scarlet-cover-issue-5-663x1024.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="5772" data-permalink="/2011/05/31/yes-maybe-no-three-comics/scarlet-cover-issue-5-663x1024/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/scarlet-cover-issue-5-663x1024.jpg?fit=663%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="663,1024" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Scarlet Cover" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/scarlet-cover-issue-5-663x1024.jpg?fit=194%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/scarlet-cover-issue-5-663x1024.jpg?fit=663%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5772" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/scarlet-cover-issue-5-663x1024-194x300.jpg?resize=194%2C300" alt="Cover for issue 5 of Brian Michael Bendis' comic, Scarlet.

<p>Bendis is a lot better on his creator-owned work than he is when he’s writing superheroes for Marvel, and <strong>Scarlet</strong> is among the best of his creator-owned stuff. The first plot arc just finished, so now’s as good a time as any to get started here.</p>
<p>Scarlet was a regular hipster kid in Portland, just generally existing. Then things went wrong and she learnt a harsh lesson in how messed up the world is. Now she’s running a grass-roots revolution. That’s the basic gist of the series. Oh, and she wants your help and is telling the whole story via fourth-wall breaking narration. Between some excellent lines and a fantastic snapshot life sketch in the first issue, we get Scarlet as a nicely well-developed character, someone we can accept as real.</p>
<p>It’s an interesting look at what it takes to shake someone out of their comfortable middle-class white comfort zone, and what they do next. And with everything being told to us via Scarlet, who very definitely has an agenda, we get to see how bias colours perception. The police and politicians aren’t all corrupt and evil, but seen through Scarlet’s eyes they become significantly darker. These aren’t events as they are, they’re events as one person believes they are. And I’m a sucker for an unreliable narrator.</p>
<p>The art serves as a distinct counterpoint to <strong>Carbon Grey’s</strong> over-the-top women and frequently absurd costumes. Scarlet, and the people she interacts with, look like real people. They dress, move and talk like real people. This is perhaps not surprising, given that (long-time Bendis collaborator and fantastic artist) <strong>Alex Maleev</strong> does a hell of a lot of photo referencing, to the point where it’s almost a comic equivalent of a rotoscoped film like <strong>A Scanner Darkly</strong>. It’s definitely nice to see, though.</p>
<p>So there you go. Go read <strong>Scarlet</strong>, consider <strong>Carbon Grey</strong>, and bin any spare copies of <strong>Neonomicon</strong> you find, before Judgement Day rolls around.</p>
