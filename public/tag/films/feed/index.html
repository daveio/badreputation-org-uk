					<description><![CDATA[I want to know why pretty much all of Disney's villains display some kind of sexual or gender deviance.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>In 1937 Goebbels presented a birthday gift of 18 Mickey Mouse shorts to the Führer. [&#8230;Disney] and Hitler [&#8230;] shared an overall social vision. They dreamed of a dispersed post-urban society, with a population — kept in line by a strong domestic realm instilling a keen sense of blood loyalty and &#8220;family values&#8221; — that could be efficiently mobilized to serve either the military needs of the state or the labor needs of industry.</p>
<p>&#8211; Matt Roth, <strong><a href="http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC40folder/LionKing.html">The Lion King: a Short History of Disney-Fascism</a></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Everyone knows about Disney&#8217;s ongoing <a href="http://www.cracked.com/article_15677_the-9-most-racist-disney-characters.html">racism issues</a>, so to hear that Uncle Walt was an active member of the American Nazi Party during the Thirties may not come as much surprise. But there were pink triangles as well as yellow stars in 1930s Berlin, and I want to know why pretty much all of Disney&#8217;s villains seem designed to display some kind of sexual or gender deviance.</p>
<h3>An Actor&#8217;s Life for Me</h3>

<p>It starts with Pinocchio, and the Fox and the Cat. Probably best remembered for their song &#8216;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEQjgGMKqt8">An Actor&#8217;s Life for Me</a>&#8216;, it&#8217;s this pair of crooks that first lure young Pinocchio off the straight and narrow. And I mean that literally: they&#8217;re Theatre Folk, dapper, urbane and not a little camp. Their bodies are constantly intertwining, grotesque and chaotic. I&#8217;m with Matt Roth when he says they&#8217;re obviously coded as gay &#8211; one of the key minorities Hitler argued, in <strong>Mein Kampf</strong>, were threatening the health and morality of contemporary  European youth.</p>
<p>But this doesn&#8217;t end with the fall of Hitler; later Disney films work their way through a succession of sexually deviant or ambiguous villains. The first significant entrant is the terrifying <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maleficent" title="Wikipedia: Maleficent">Maleficent</a> in <strong>Sleeping Beauty</strong>(1959). Like <strong>Aladdin</strong>&#8216;s Jafar (1992), she is elegant and a bit camp, though fundamentally sexless (witness how unattracted Jafar is to Princess Jasmine, wanting her only for political gains). Maleficent inhabits a strange underworld where orgiastic parties are the norm, and, like so many of her villainous successors, she&#8217;s got no-one of her own, but still remains determined to thwart the monogamous, heterosexual union of the noble royals Princess Aurora and Prince Philip (whose name was chosen by Uncle Walt in the 50s, when our Prince Philip was still someone nostalgia-loving Anglophile Americans might feel dewy-eyed about).</p>

<p>Two years later, <strong>101 Dalmatians</strong>&#8216; Cruella De Vil continues the trend. She shares Maleficent&#8217;s ill will towards the heteronormative family sphere, and acts as a kind of child-snatching boogyman. Her hyper-femme fashion sense only throws her withered, sexless frame into relief, and unlike the blissful feminine home of her friend Anita &#8211; who has settled down and found a nice man to take care of, sorting out Roger&#8217;s chaotic life with a Woman&#8217;s Touch &#8211;  Cruella&#8217;s decadent mansion is completely falling apart, which we can probably assume also mirrors the state of her biological clock. Cruella&#8217;s flamboyant yet barren sexuality focuses itself instead on fetishising the traditional trappings of femininity, including fur coats made from the produce of wombs more fecund than her own &#8211; like Perdita, the sexy Dalmatian.</p>
<h3>Dragged Up</h3>
<p>In the 80s, long after Walt&#8217;s death, the intentional gender deviance of Disney&#8217;s villains becomes more blatant still: this time the Gays are even more obviously in drag, and they&#8217;re looking back to the golden <strong>Pinocchio</strong> age of seducing The Children away from their suburban homes: think of Ursula in <strong>The Little Mermaid </strong>(1989) and her contrast with the alpha male King Triton, his big beard, and the Barbie-style InnoDBl with her<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SEyW8eXESQk/TpPRCtPiisI/AAAAAAAAATo/brAhE0e1a9w/s1600/littlemermaid2.jpg"> Princess Diana hair</a>.</p>

<p>Ursula is overweight, flamboyant and dragged up; her tentacles, as my pal Matt Roth points out (you really must read <a href="http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC40folder/LionKing.html">this article</a>, seriously), only make her the more sexually ambiguous. Like Maleficent, she lives in an underground other-world, with a &#8216;garden&#8217; of corrupted young people now condemned to live half-lives as plant-like beings. Her stagey hyper-femininity presents her as a dangerous prospect for the heteronormative, cisnormative InnoDBl &#8211; whose <em>voice</em> she steals in order to seduce the also very straight Prince Eric.</p>
<p>Ursula is given a metaphorical kind of new life (after being conquered by, er, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDGrSgTKEuw&amp;t=3m8s">the erect prow of Prince Eric&#8217;s enormous ship</a>) in the figure of Hades in <strong>Hercules </strong>(1997). He&#8217;s pretty much an exact counterpart to Ursula, black tentacles and all. His cabaret-style song &#8216;My Town&#8217;, from the <strong>Hercules</strong> TV series, introduces the underworld as a kind of underground New York, with its king a flamboyant, gender-ambiguous leader revelling in its delights:</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting, of course, that because of the source-text, <strong>Hercules</strong> must of necessity espouse the Ancient Greek worldview that says the Underworld &#8211; and therefore Hades himself &#8211; is a crucial part of the order of things; unlike the shady worlds of Pleasure Island and The Theatre in Nazi-era <strong>Pinocchio</strong>, &#8216;New Hades&#8217;, and the queers and deviants that inhabit it is a potentially corrupting influence that can be tolerated, as long as it&#8217;s kept firmly in its place. It&#8217;s much the same theory as the &#8216;Circle of Life&#8217; proposed by Mufasa in <strong>The Lion King </strong>(1994) &#8211; the ghettoised handout-dependent hyenas and their liberal, childless and urbane overlord Scar are fine, as long as they&#8217;re kept in their own sphere (that is, the obscure Elephants&#8217; Graveyard). When they take over, the Pridelands fall into ruin and corruption.</p>

<h3>Hanging on</h3>
<div id="attachment_10879" style="width: 309px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/LeFou1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10879" data-attachment-id="10879" data-permalink="/2012/07/04/my-town-the-strange-sexuality-of-disneys-underworld/lefou-2/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/LeFou1.jpg?fit=299%2C164&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="299,164" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="LeFou" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/LeFou1.jpg?fit=299%2C164&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/LeFou1.jpg?fit=299%2C164&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-10879" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/LeFou1.jpg?resize=299%2C164" alt="Le Fou fawns on Gaston and constantly occupies his personal space" width="299" height="164" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-10879" class="wp-caption-text">Intertwined: the hyper-masculine Gaston and the fawning creature Le Fou</p></div>
<p>There are also a whole host of less significant characters throughout Disney&#8217;s oeuvre who are mostly made ridiculous by virtue of their sexual ambiguity and concomitant lack of personhood. First up is the rotund Le Fou in <strong>Beauty and the Beast</strong>, who fawns, much like the Cat on the Fox, on the hyper-male Gaston (who is in strange contrast to the uber-femme but dragged up Ursula, and seems suspiciously uninterested in the various females laid on for his consumption).</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s Chi Fu, the emperor&#8217;s advisor in <strong>Mulan</strong>. He is primarily ridiculed because he is camp and rather gender-ambiguous &#8211; he has bunny slippers and a woman&#8217;s scream &#8211; in what I&#8217;d suggest is a double-whammy of homophobia mixed with Orientalist racism, much like that currently directed against Asian-American basketball player Jeremy Lin (<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/feb/21/jeremy-lin-racism-asian-americans">&#8216;Some lucky lady in NYC is gonna feel a couple of inches of pain tonight</a>&#8216; was a tweet from Fox sports commentator Jason Witlock on Lin&#8217;s recent sporting triumph). Or, to put it in Disney&#8217;s own terms, how about the notorious Siamese Cats in <strong>Lady and the Tramp</strong>, whose own gender is confused to say the least?</p>
<h3>Miss Man</h3>
<div id="attachment_10880" style="width: 190px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/mulan1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10880" data-attachment-id="10880" data-permalink="/2012/07/04/my-town-the-strange-sexuality-of-disneys-underworld/mulan-2/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/mulan1.jpg?fit=180%2C255&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="180,255" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="mulan" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/mulan1.jpg?fit=180%2C255&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/mulan1.jpg?fit=180%2C255&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-10880" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/mulan1.jpg?resize=180%2C255" alt="When Mulan's hair is up, she's a man." width="180" height="255" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-10880" class="wp-caption-text">The only difference between male and female Mulan is a bit of grooming.</p></div>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting to compare these gender-fails with Chi Fu&#8217;s own filmic context &#8211; <strong>Mulan </strong>(1998), where the title character is herself cross-dressing. There are two direct references to drag in this film (strange, given that Disney doesn&#8217;t in general have much of Dreamworks&#8217; obsessive-compulsive need to shove in over-the-kids&#8217;-heads jokes for the parents). The only one in direct reference to Mulan is Mushu (Eddie Murphy)&#8217;s Hilarious Ebonics &#8211; &#8216;Miss Man had to take her little drag act on the road&#8217;.</p>
<p>Yet, unlike the true weirdos doing it for a sexual thrill (like Ursula), Mulan&#8217;s is a noble gender-variance, taken on for the sole purpose of rescuing her ailing father and (ultimately) preparing herself mentally for marriage, which is how the film ends; note too that she has to become male in order to truly triumph in the male sphere, and that once this has been accomplished she can return home to her father and marry the sexy shirtless man (as she was unable to do at the beginning of the story).</p>
<p>It is therefore in keeping that her methodology basically amounts to &#8216;hair down = female; hair up = male&#8217; &#8211; and no-one ever notices it&#8217;s all the same person, just with a different hairstyle (note <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3f2is11VL0&amp;t=1m19s">how shocked the Evil Shan Yu is when she dons her &#8216;disguise</a>&#8216;): her gender-switch is more of a &#8216;sign&#8217; to the audience indicating which social sphere she&#8217;s inhabiting than anything literally transformative. Interesting stuff here.</p>
<p>Hmm. So&#8230; From the Fox and the Cat to the villains of the 90s, Disney&#8217;s villains have represented a kind of &#8216;other&#8217; that is almost always couched in terms of gender or sexuality, representing a challenge, and a threat, to the heteronormative worldview of the heroes and heroines &#8211; which always conquers, of course. What&#8217;s disturbing is that it&#8217;s so oft-repeated it almost becomes the whole unspoken tenet on which Disney&#8217;s works are based. The fight of good vs. evil is not so much a battle of objective morality as of sexual identity and preference.</p>
<p>Oops.</p>

<h3>The Plot Sickens</h3>
<p>To focus on misogyny is to obscure <strong>American Psycho</strong>’s scope, to ignore that the book is an uncompromising, unapologetic vortex of misanthropy and nihilism. Its narrator expresses disgust, contempt, anxiety and fear towards women, gay people, art students, Jewish people, the non-WASP, the homeless, the poor – anyone, in fact, who differs even by a small degree (a marginally more impressive business card, a better restaurant table) from the ideal which Bateman forces himself to emulate and sustain. Men in the novel are portrayed as unsympathetically as women, and dispatched as dispassionately – so why is it the torture and death of women that seems to abide with the reader?</p>

<p>Like all satire, the book exaggerates and burlesques that which already exists. The book’s scenes of torture and murder were, apparently, all based on Ellis’ reading of real life cases and criminology textbooks, not whimsically called into being by him. So <strong>American Psycho</strong> on one level is an uncensored, unsanitised exposé of what has already been done to women without any incitement or instruction from its author. Neither does Ellis’ writing give the impression that violence against women is in any way attractive. The impression it does give, to me at least, is that violence against women is horrifying, viscerally disgusting, and the preserve of fucked-up, nightmarish individuals who are increasingly prevalent during a stage of socio-economic development which encourages selfishness and greed over empathy, and whose actions are increasingly ignored or disbelieved within the same environment. His work is a mirror, not a manifesto or an instruction manual. To posit it as something qualitatively worse either than crimes actually committed against women throughout history, or to the presentation of sexualised violence or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_killer#In_media_and_popular_culture">serial killing </a>in almost any other area of the entertainment world, seems dubious.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting too how the deaths of Bateman’s victims are affected by their socio-economic background. Having decided against the murder of his date Patricia – a minor character so boringly materialistic that I’m fully on board with the theory that takes her to be Patrick’s imaginary female persona – Bateman reflects on whether it’s ‘her family’s wealth [that] protects her tonight’. In contrast, the vagrants and call girls he kills are already economic casualties, considered disposable even before they become casualties of violence. No character from society&#8217;s lower strata appears to be missed; it is only Paul Owen, Patrick&#8217;s peer and rival, whose disappearance is considered deserving enough to warrant a police investigation. The crude and blatant contrast between Bateman’s lifestyle and that of his victims – their disparity in wealth, and therefore in power, is explicitly fetishized in more than one encounter – which calls attention to the issue of why the victims of such killers are so often sex workers, or homeless, or transient, both male and female:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Within police culture&#8230; we know that if a prostitute goes missing and is reported as missing, that they won&#8217;t be given the same priority as other people would get&#8230; [sex workers are not] valued enough in our culture for the police to take it seriously.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8211; <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2010/dec/22/world-violence-sex-workers">David Wilson, Howard League for Penal Reform</a></p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; again intertwining a socio-economic indictment with a proto-feminist impulse.</p>

<p>One could argue incessantly about whether the book itself is misogynistic, or edifying, or indeed readable, but a<br />
<a href="http://www.socialjusticeleague.net/2011/09/how-to-be-a-fan-of-problematic-things/">more productive debate</a> centres on whether one can like art that one also acknowledges as problematic. When reading Anwyn Crawford’s excellent <a href="http://njmcgee.tumblr.com/post/282550705/anwyn-crawford-makes-an-impressive-attack-on-nick">critique</a> of the treatment of women in the lyrics and prose of that other aging <em>enfant terrible</em>, Nick Cave, I wasn’t convinced by all of her analysis – Cave&#8217;s work at least in its earlier phases seems, like Ellis, preoccupied with morbidly examining a pathologised masculinity rather than valorising it – but the most substantial point I drew from the ensuing debate was that the issue may be less such works themselves and more their involvement in the mainstreaming, acceptance and excusing of problematic attitudes. The gynophobic aspects of these works are made respectable by being cloaked as edgy or transgressive, when they merely dramatise the violence and inequality that already exists. Although I still contend that the violence in Ellis’ writing is not there as intentional titillation, as long as there are those for whom such things are lived experience, rather than escapist fantasy or performance material, then there will be a correspondingly visceral response to their artistic portrayal.</p>
<p>Although readers who read for prurient or puerile pleasure are hardly something for which writers can bargain or legislate, questions can be asked about the <em>cachet</em> Ellis manages to retain in the world of <strong>Guardian</strong> profiles and Soho salons, when other works of equally politicised and equally slapstick splatterpunk – Dennis Cooper, say, or Stewart Home, or even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCUM_Manifesto"><strong>The SCUM Manifesto</strong></a> – languish in the ‘cult fiction’ gutter. Helen Zahavi&#8217;s brilliant <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_Weekend_(novel)"><strong>Dirty Weekend</strong></a>, a novel published the same year as <strong>American Psycho</strong>, explores similar themes but blurs the lines between victim and perpetrator. There are marked stylistic differences, sure – Zahavi uses lyrical prose to distance or distract the reader from the trauma and gore she describes, whereas Ellis more or less rubs the reader’s face in it – and the violence of Zahavi’s protagonist is entirely reactive: she wishes only to be left alone and when she is not, she strikes out and strikes upwards. <strong>Dirty Weekend</strong>, despite receiving polarised reviews on publication, has had nothing like the long-term vilification heaped upon <strong>American Psycho</strong>, but by the same token has received far less enduring acclaim or even attention.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s just Ellis’ pre-existing status as <em>wunderkind</em> author of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Less_Than_Zero_(novel)"><strong>Less Than Zero</strong></a> that elevates his subsequent work. Or it might be the very obviousness of his traditionalist politics &#8211; <strong>American Psycho</strong> has more than a bit in common with something like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_exit_to_brooklyn"><strong>Last Exit to Brooklyn</strong></a>, a cult novel of 1964 which also enlists depictions of depravity and sexual violence in the service of what can look an awful lot like proscriptive neo-puritanism. Is there more mainstream space for works which reproduce existing social structures and power relations, which, even if they challenge their existence, do so through the evidently ambiguous strategies of grotesque exaggeration or <em>reductio ad ridiculum </em>rather than direct disruption? For all its horrified laughter at the state we’re in, <strong>American Psycho</strong> isn’t in the business of imagining alternatives to it.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[American Psycho is a house built with the tools of the master: it is, just like 80s capitalism, crass, lurid, vulgar, heavy-handed and unapologetic.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The last time I wrote that <a href="http://velvetcoalmine.wordpress.com/2011/05/26/on-liking-american-psycho/">yes, I did like <strong>American Psycho</strong></a>, and no, that wasn&#8217;t because I&#8217;d only seen the film, I was pleasantly surprised to hear that other women felt similarly, but I’m aware that we’re still a minority. <strong>American Psycho</strong> proved controversial even before its release in 1991, its unedited manuscript pushed from publisher to publisher, leaked extracts from it incurring public outrage, and its eventual appearance leapt upon by critics with the single-minded speed of a rat up a Habitrail tube. In terms of people judging the book without having read it, not a great deal seems to have changed. I don&#8217;t really expect to alter anyone&#8217;s opinion with this post, and it isn&#8217;t really even a recommendation &#8211; it&#8217;s just an exploration of why I don&#8217;t regard <strong>American Psycho</strong> as the worst book ever written.</p>

<p>I read the book as a deeply moral – disappointingly puritan, if you like – anti-capitalist and even vaguely feminist tract. <strong>American Psycho</strong> is a house built with the tools of the master: it is, just like 1980s capitalism, crass, lurid, vulgar, heavy-handed and unapologetic. It bludgeons home its basic homily, that consumerism fails to make us happy or to lend meaning to our lives, with all the subtle and delicate artistry of a Reagan speech. But beyond this, in 2012 it’s undeniable that the values and trends the book castigated two decades back have only become more deeply entrenched. Does the book’s earnest, and still depressingly relevant, indictment of capitalism and consumerism excuse its scenes of rape, torture and murder? Maybe not, but I think those who criticise the book on these grounds, like those who called for its suppression and boycott twenty years ago, end up alienating a potential if problematic ally.</p>
<h3>Nightmares on Wall Street</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to take seriously much that Ellis says, about either this book in particular or his work in general. A lot of his public pronouncements deal in Dylanesque obfuscation, or deliberate outrage-baiting – his Twitter account alone is a masterclass in trolling – which makes it both absurd and unfortunate that his work is so often perceived as deadly serious and condemned on the same grounds. His explanations of the origins of <strong>American Psycho</strong>, though, have the ring of sincerity, and place the book in opposition to the impact of 1980s society and culture on the individual male:</p>
<blockquote><p>‘the book is, need I even say this, a criticism of a certain kind of masculinity and a certain kind of white male, heterosexual, capitalist, yuppie scumbag behavior.’</p>
<p>– <a href="http://www.punkglobe.com/breteastonellisinterview0411.php">Bret Easton Ellis, 2011 </a></p>
<p>‘Whenever I am asked to talk American Psycho, I have to remember why I was writing it at the time and what it meant to me. A lot of it had to do with my frustration with having to become an adult and what it meant to be an adult male in American society. I didn&#8217;t want to be one, because all it was about was status. Consumerist success was really the embodiment of what it meant to be a cool guy.’<br />
&#8211; <a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/authors/interviews/article/47587-american-psycho-at-20-catching-up-with-bret-easton-ellis.html">Bret Easton Ellis, 2011</a></p>
<p>‘[Bateman] was crazy the same way [I was]. He did not come out of me sitting down and wanting to write a grand sweeping indictment of yuppie culture. It initiated because of my own isolation and alienation at a point in my life. I was living like Patrick Bateman. I was slipping into a consumerist kind of void that was supposed to give me confidence and make me feel good about myself but just made me feel worse and worse and worse about myself.’<br />
&#8211; <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/rage/archive/s3034896.htm">Bret Easton Ellis, 2010</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Fay Weldon, one of very few women to <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/1991/apr/25/fiction.breteastonellis">positively review</a> the novel, did so while emphasising its anti-capitalist aspects. <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Shopping-Space-American-Generation-Fiction/dp/1852422556/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1336917717&amp;sr=1-2">Elizabeth Young</a>, too, identified Patrick Bateman as not a character but a cipher indicating the nihilism and emptiness of yuppie culture and identity.</p>
<p>Bateman is of course capitalism’s dirty little secret &#8211; the madman in the attic. His sociopathy is mirrored in the socio-economic inequality and political insincerity around him. In his world, the atomised and alienated dealings of colleagues, friends and lovers are highlighted through contrast with the visceral intimacy of murder, and Ellis’ stylistic trick of detailing frenzied sex and violence in flat and clinically dispassionate prose does not disguise that as a form of human encounter it carries more weight than Bateman’s ritualised interactions with colleagues or his sexless and loveless interactions with girlfriends. His narration frequently betrays a yearning for consummation, contact and engagement in the midst of the desperate aching loneliness, the longing for meaning (even Bateman’s violence is purposeless and arbitrary) which permeates the book. In a society so unsustainably alienating and unequal that the centre plainly cannot hold, we see how badly things can fall apart.</p>
<h3>Psycho Drama</h3>
<p>Accused of having written ‘a how-to novel on the torture and dismemberment of women’, Ellis <a href="http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,313573,00.html">found himself</a> subject to boycotts, hate mail, death threats and violent revenge fantasies, on the basis that he had clearly written this book as either wish-fulfillment or glamorised incitement. Detractors of the book and author on these grounds display a puzzling inability to distinguish between creator and creation, which as a first principle is utterly bizarre – where is it written that characters must necessarily be extensions of an approving creator?</p>
<p>The novel contains a few dozen pages in amongst four hundred or so on the torture and dismemberment of women – and of men – though their impact is disproportionate. These scenes – often ludicrous, often grotesque to the point of comedy – are presented as a logical extension of the lack of empathy and mindless, numb urge to consume that characterise the world in which they take place. They don’t seem written in order to arouse any more than the determinedly un-erotic, sterile sex scenes do, or the interminable deconstructions of clothes, cosmetics and Huey Lewis’ back catalogue. The book gradually reaches a point where reading about all three feels indistinguishable in its horrific, unrelenting tedium.</p>

I got through these scenes gingerly on my first read, treating it as a kind of endurance test, but tend to skip them on subsequent reads as they aren&#8217;t the reasons I revisit the book. I read <strong>American Psycho</strong> in the same semi-masochistic spirit in which I watch, for instance, Chris Morris’ and Charlie Brooker’s hipster-eviscerating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Barley"><strong>Nathan Barley</strong></a>, a work also bleakly amusing, also received with disbelief and criticism of its gratuitousness, and also concerned with the consequences of elevating surface over meaning, although its slack-jawed, skinny-jeaned targets were more symptom than cause – and arguably Ellis had already been there, done that, too, with 1998’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glamorama"><strong>Glamorama</strong></a>. I read <strong>American Psycho</strong> like I’d read any work which explored capitalism, consumerism and their messy, distasteful effects, from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_to_the_End_of_the_Night"><strong>Voyage au bout de la nuit</strong></a> to <strong>The Hunger Games</strong>. (But not de Sade. Sometimes life’s just too short.)</p>
<p>Finally, if perhaps most obviously, it takes some effort to read Ellis’ presentation of Bateman’s attitude or actions as approving. Unlike, say, Thomas Harris depicting Hannibal Lecter, or the creators of <strong>Dexter</strong>, he gives his anti-hero little in the way of charisma or appeal. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Harron">Mary Harron</a>’s film of the novel, produced a decade after it when the stardust of the 1980s had settled somewhat, arguably does more than the book to establish Ellis’ unreliable narrator as a slick and stylish seducer rather than a pathetic interchangeable fantasist. Despite the <a href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/foreignc/2012/03/american-psycho.html">subversive</a> nature of Harron’s direction, Christian Bale&#8217;s <em>tour-de-force</em> performance renders Bateman far more compelling than his written incarnation, who is overtly racist, misogynistic and homophobic as well as dim, snobbish, superficial, chronically insecure, socially awkward, a hopeless conversationalist, and tediously obsessed with material goods. If it weren’t for the fact that almost every other character displays exactly the same character traits, it’s conceivable that the novel’s Bateman could make his dates expire of boredom without any need to break out the pneumatic nail-gun.</p>
<p>It’s interesting too that the film’s elevation of Bateman is bound up with its objectification of him, particularly via its concentration on his character’s <a href="http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=515985">proto</a>&#8211;<a href="http://www.marksimpson.com/pages/journalism/metrosexual_beckham.html">metrosexual </a>aspects, but that’s a whole other essay.</p>
