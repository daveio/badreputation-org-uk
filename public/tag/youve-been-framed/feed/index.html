										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First there was You’ve Been Framed. Then there was Jackass. Now we have YouTube. We just can’t get enough of people doing really stupid things and the hilariously violent consequences.</p>
<p>Is it schadenfreude? (or ‘leedvermaak’ in Dutch – there you go, you’ve learnt something new today) Is it innocent slapstick? Who knows. But whatever it is that makes watching people fall over so compelling has been turned into a FORCE FOR GOOD by the <a title="End Violence Against Women" href="http://www.endviolenceagainstwomen.org.uk/" target="_blank">End Violence Against Women</a> coalition, with their new <a title="We Are Man" href="http://weareman.co.uk/" target="_blank">We Are Man</a> campaign video:</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZYhaodUPqSU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>I think it’s rather splendid, especially the skier who flies into the wall of snow like something out of Looney Tunes. My only niggle is that there wasn’t a more natural way of bringing up the topic of rape in the men’s conversation. I’ve overheard plenty of examples that would do the job. Though perhaps this was actually overheard somewhere, from a particularly gauche misogynist. Or maybe it’s deliberately awkward. Anyway&#8230;</p>
<p>There’s no one size fits all way to challenge attitudes to sexual violence, and some people will respond more to one approach than another. I reckon this is an excellent addition to the earnest <a href="http://www.mystrength.org/">My Strength is Not For Hurting</a> campaign and the stylish Lambeth <a href="../2011/01/18/found-feminism-%E2%80%9Cknow-the-difference%E2%80%9D-%E2%80%93-lambeth-rape-prevention-campaign/">Know The Difference</a> posters.</p>
<p>Why not pass it on to some people you know, especially men, and put it to the test? If you could encourage them to get their click on <a title="We Are Man" href="http://weareman.co.uk/" target="_blank">here </a>and join the campaign that would be even better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS Interesting comment on twitter from <a title="PabloK on Twitter" href="http://www.twitter.com/pablok" target="_blank">@PabloK</a> about the way that anti violence against women campaigns targeted at men always invoke a model of hegemonic masculinity (e.g. &#8216;be a man&#8217;, &#8216;be strong, &#8216;real men do/don&#8217;t&#8217; etc) Obviously this is to do with the intended audience, but anyone got any ideas stashed away for campaign creative that offers an alternative?</p>
