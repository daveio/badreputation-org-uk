<blockquote><p>The “Rock the Red Pump” campaign is our annual initiative to commemorate National Women and Girls HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. It has become our biggest initiative, and is what started The Red Pump Project. Since 2009, when we had over 100 bloggers “Rock the Red Pump,” we have started the “Rock the Red Pump – 500 in 50” to get 500 blogs to participate in the 50 days leading up to NWGHAAD.</p>
<p>The blog network we have is unique in that they are women who acknowledge the severity of the issue and understand the importance of conversation. The power and influence of these bloggers has driven The Red Pump Project to where it is today.</p>
<p>&#8211; <a href="http://www.theredpumpproject.org/what-we-do/"><strong>The Red Pump Project</strong></a></p></blockquote>
<p>Hey now, I thought. Why isn&#8217;t this more well-known? Why didn&#8217;t I know about this day? I only know about World AIDS Day. Maybe it <em>is</em> more widely known, but only in the US? I hear about lots of other US-y things with a tedious regularity from Black Friday<sup><a href="/2012/02/15/put-your-red-shoes-on/#footnote_0_9777" id="identifier_0_9777" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" in my world this is not about shopping but about suffragettes being murdered. Look it up. ">1</a></sup> to the Superb Owl<sup><a href="/2012/02/15/put-your-red-shoes-on/#footnote_1_9777" id="identifier_1_9777" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" I refuse to spell this twitterfeed-nuking parade of strange noises any other way. ">2</a></sup>. Either way, even though the Red Pump Project isn&#8217;t UK-based, I thought it was way cool.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re US-based (and maybe even if you&#8217;re not; does it matter?) you can sign your blog up and download a Red Pump badge. There are <a href="http://www.theredpumpproject.org/hivaids-and-women/">excellent reasons to get involved here</a>. One reason I would add: I believe, with a strength that leads me to shout unbecomingly in pubs, that HIV awareness campaigns should always be designed and conducted in a way that is inclusive and above all non-stigmatising of people living with HIV. The <a href="http://www.thebody.com/content/art61152.html">Hitler campaign?</a> The <a href="http://girllikeme.org/2011/03/09/taking-away-stigma-i-am-not-an-ugly-scorpion-which-adds-to-the-stigma/">Scorpion campaign?</a> Ugh. It doesn&#8217;t help if you raise awareness of HIV transmission risks by presenting HIV positive people as dangerous monsters. It leads to more concealment, less disclosure, less openness generally about HIV, and people being actively ostracised and in many cases places in actual physical danger. It&#8217;s disgusting. I could rant a while about stigma and the vicious circle of ignorance and erasure it feeds. Or, y&#8217;know, <a href="http://www.thebody.com/content/46169/hiv-aids-blog-central.html?ic=3001">go read The Body</a>. Actually, that&#8217;s a better idea. Do that instead. Preferable campaigns in my book: examples such as <a href="http://www.hivaware.org.uk/act-aware/support-campaign.php">Act Aware</a>, which <a href="http://www.hivaware.org.uk/be-aware/real-stories.php">actually engages with the concept of stigma</a>, or <a href="http://www.tht.org.uk/howyoucanhelpus/worldaidsday/">THT&#8217;s Stand Up, Stand Out</a>.</p>
<p>So, yeah: I get very excited when I see a well-designed awareness project. On a broader political level I think there are limits to the efficacy of consumerism-inspired charity initiatives in the West &#8211; <a href="http://www.joinred.com/red"><strong>(RED)</strong></a>, for example, relies not solely on donations but on people shopping for expensive products and in some cases wearing their awareness as a fashion item, which only goes so far. (RED)&#8217;s &#8216;use global capitalism for good&#8217; approach was groundbreaking to a point, but the level to which large sections of its site will simply redirect you to the Converse store can be quite grating. Its campaigning focus is primarily on funding initiatives in subsaharan Africa, which is great &#8211; but not the whole story.</p>
<p>However, the Red Pump Project, unlike (RED), is a grassroots initiative that has taken off in the US, with an emphasis on women and women of colour which I can only applaud. I like that the project takes elements of the (RED) approach and focuses less on the idea that &#8220;luxury goods over here will generate aid over <em>there</em>&#8221; and more on, say, testing a thousand people in an inner city community. I like that the graphic &#8211; which has trainers on it too! &#8211; places non-white wearers of the pumps front and centre and in the majority. It makes a nice change. Rae Lewis-Thornton, who <a href="http://www.raelewisthornton.com/2012/02/problem-of-stigma.html">speaks eloquently about stigma here</a>, has also endorsed it. While fighting stigma is an implicit rather than explicit aim in the approach the project has taken, they are <a href="http://www.theredpumpproject.org/2011/09/hiv-criminalization-what-do-you-know/">talking about</a> the issues, and via their blog badge campaign, helping make sure anyone can get involved, rather than those who shop for luxury goods. Most of all, they&#8217;re effectively marketing a breakout in HIV activism from simply focussing on World AIDS Day in December, instead broadening the approach to include dedicated action throughout the year on behalf of women and girls (March 10), Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day (February 7) and so on.</p>
<p>Good stuff.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, you&#8217;ve read <a href="http://www.hivaware.org.uk/">HIV Aware</a>, you&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/12/01/markgrafs-world-aids-day-rampage/">mythbusted with us</a> (and thank you, by the way, everyone who linked and RT&#8217;d that post on <a href="http://twitter.com/BadRepUK">Twitter</a> and elsewhere)&#8230; what now?</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/ribbons.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="8816" data-permalink="/2011/12/02/a-post-world-aids-day-linkpost-go-forth-and-read/ribbons/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/ribbons.jpg?fit=375%2C500&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="375,500" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="ribbons" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/ribbons.jpg?fit=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/ribbons.jpg?fit=375%2C500&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-8816 alignright" title="ribbons" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/ribbons.jpg?resize=300%2C400" alt="Image of a giant red AIDS awareness ribbon made by scattering many individual little ribbons on a white sheet in the looped shape of a ribbon. Image by Flickr user lusciousblopster, shared under Creative Commons licence" width="300" height="400" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/ribbons.jpg?w=375&amp;ssl=1 375w, https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/ribbons.jpg?w=225&amp;ssl=1 225w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>What about stigma? As we tweeted yesterday, Act Aware isn&#8217;t, and should never be, about judging and othering people who are living with HIV. It should never be about erasure.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for all of us, the majority of mainstream media approaches to HIV issues in the UK are either woefully ill-informed, groaning under the weight of crappily pieced-together assumptions, often even kind of creepily bigoted, or just plain fifteen years out of date. Even with <a href="http://www.nat.org.uk/Information-and-Resources/Media-reporting.aspx">NAT&#8217;s helpful press guide</a> freely available. Hooray.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s a thing: if you&#8217;re reading this, you&#8217;re in luck. For lo, the internet is as full of glory as it is full of shit. And with very little effort on your part it basically becomes your own PERSONAL BULLSHIT ESCAPE TUNNEL. And we&#8217;re about to make it even easier.</p>
<p>So here are some World AIDS Day links you might or might not have seen before, which we&#8217;ve been reading at BadRep Towers. Beyond Acting Aware and reading myths and facts, are real people. So go and read about them. Make it so!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.thebody.com/"><strong>The Body</strong></a>: this is a really, really valuable resource. It&#8217;s also a blogging platform for a large team of people living with and/or campaigning about HIV and AIDS, featuring <a href="http://www.thebody.com/index/inspire.html?ic=3001">personal stories</a> from a wide range of backgrounds and age groups (though we have not found any trans* men&#8217;s stories on there as yet). It&#8217;s been going for years and has tons of pop culture analysis. <strong>Our picks:</strong> <a href="http://www.thebody.com/content/art61152.html">&#8216;I Agree, We Are Not A F***ing Scorpion&#8217;</a>, <a href="http://www.thebody.com/content/63938/hivaids-and-latinas-what-does-gender-have-to-do-wi.html">&#8216;HIV, AIDS and Latinas: What Does Gender Have To Do With It?&#8217;</a>, <a href="http://www.thebody.com/content/art58907.html">&#8216;The Trials of Transition&#8217;</a>, and <a href="http://www.thebody.com/content/art58093.html">&#8216;Wanted: Feminist Warriors To Fight HIV and AIDS&#8217;</a>,</li>
<li><a href="http://www.poz.com/"><strong>The Poz</strong></a>: like The Body, this magazine is also a giant resource with tons of interesting <a href="http://blogs.poz.com/">blogs</a>. <strong>Our picks:</strong> <a href="http://blogs.poz.com/staff/archives/2011/09/game_down_low_aids.html">&#8216;Game, the Down-Low and AIDS&#8217;</a> and <a href="http://blogs.poz.com/aundarayguess/">&#8216;Wearing The Red Ribbon&#8217;</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter: <a href="http://twitter.com/nat_aids_trust">@NAT_AIDS_Trust</a></strong> (they run HIVAware) are enthusiastic, friendly, ready to engage with and @-reply to as many people as they can and eager to arm you with facts and stories from around the UK. Through them, we found <strong>UKPositiveLad</strong>: diagnosed a few months ago at 25, he&#8217;s <a href="http://twitter.com/UKPositiveLad">tweeting</a> his experiences, and <a href="http://ukpositivelad.wordpress.com/2011/11/30/my-first-world-aids-day/">blogging them too</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.queertransmen.org/index.php"><strong>QueerTransMen:</strong></a> a Canada-based sexual health site for queer trans* men with <a href="http://www.queertransmen.org/index.php?option=com_content&#038;task=view&#038;id=22&#038;Itemid=2">research</a>, <a href="http://www.queertransmen.org/index.php?option=com_content&#038;task=view&#038;id=14&#038;Itemid=29&#038;limit=1&#038;limitstart=2">mythbusting</a> and <strong>Primed</strong>, a sexual health guide written by and for. <strong><em>Not worksafe!</em></strong></li>
<li><a href="http://girllikeme.org/"><strong>A Girl Like Me</strong></a>: this is a resource &#8220;where women of all ages can share their stories and promote understanding of HIV through online storytelling&#8221;. It hasn&#8217;t been very active recently, and in many ways it&#8217;s not as &#8216;off the ground&#8217; as it could be&#8230; but we think it&#8217;s a great idea anyway.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.womankind.org.uk/"><strong>Womankind Worldwide</strong></a>: one of their areas of work is around supporting effective responses to HIV in women around the world. <strong>Our picks: </strong> <a href="http://www.womankind.org.uk/2011/12/world-aids-day-2011/">World AIDS Day 2011 post</a>, <a href="http://www.womankind.org.uk/2011/10/i-was-so-glad/">&#8216;I was so glad of how interested people were of what is happening in Ghana&#8217;</a>, and <a href="http://www.womankind.org.uk/2011/05/the-long-walk-home-how-hiv-infected-women-in-ghana-seeking-support-will-go-to-any-lengths-to-avoid-exposure/">&#8216;The Long Walk Home&#8217;</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, hey. You have all this stuff at your fingertips! Connect. Discover. Find stuff out. What&#8217;s the point of being on a feminist pop culture adventure if you don&#8217;t, you know, go forth and read? Exactly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve moaned about shoddy sex education on BadRep <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/12/01/fighting-for-the-facts-about-abortion/">before</a>, but it&#8217;s back on my mind thanks to a recent <a href="http://www.brook.org.uk/professionals/application/brookpr/index.php?option=com_brookpr&amp;view=article&amp;id=91&amp;Itemid=640">survey by Brook</a> which showed that nearly half of secondary school pupils don’t think their sex and relationships education is fit for purpose. This has prompted a brace of new anti-sex education stories in the news (a typical example appeared in the <strong>Daily Mail</strong> last week<sup><a href="/2011/11/30/whos-afraid-of-sex-education/#footnote_0_8719" id="identifier_0_8719" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" Ed&rsquo;s note: I can&rsquo;t bear linking the Mail and am still in mourning for IstyOsty, but search and ye shall find; it&rsquo;s titled &ldquo;Casual Sex and &lsquo;Bad Touching&rsquo;: Guess What Your Eight Year Old Is Learning At School These Days&rdquo;. *facepalm* ">1</a></sup> and Education For Choice have responded <a title="Mythbusting Monday" href="http://educationforchoice.blogspot.com/2011/11/myth-busting-monday-teaching-children.html" target="_blank">here</a>) including one that caught me totally by surprise: a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-15877072">BNP protest outside a primary school</a> in Sheffield that had dared to extend SRE to all age groups. The what now? Are racism and xenophobia passé?</p>
<h3>Innocence and Sexualisation</h3>
<p>The vigour with which some people are prepared to attack moves towards more open, honest and comprehensive sex and relationships education is baffling. What are they so afraid of? Educating young people about safer sex doesn’t lead to an increased sexual activity (that’s from this great <a href="http://www.avert.org/aids-young-people.htm">Avert resource</a>, by the way). Two words that pop up fairly regularly in the fog of general objection are ‘innocence’ and ‘sexualisation’. I think they’re masking other, simpler causes for so much reactionary guff, but let’s have a look at them anyway.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Love-shoe.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="8721" data-permalink="/2011/11/30/whos-afraid-of-sex-education/love-shoe/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Love-shoe.jpg?fit=500%2C375&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="500,375" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;4.7&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;COOLPIX L15&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1216492649&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;17.1&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;118&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.016666666666667&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Love shoe" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Love-shoe.jpg?fit=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Love-shoe.jpg?fit=500%2C375&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-8721 alignleft" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Love-shoe.jpg?resize=360%2C270" alt="Close up of a red Converse sneaker with 'Love' written on the toe, image from www.morguefile.com" width="360" height="270" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Love-shoe.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Love-shoe.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Love-shoe.jpg?w=400&amp;ssl=1 400w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>The idea that the ‘innocence’ of children must be protected at all costs is absurd. Innocence in the criminal sense is a good thing to hold on to, of course. But innocence in the wafty Victorian lamblike sense (aka “freedom from guilt or sin through being unacquainted with evil”)?.  I fail to see the value of being ‘unacquainted with evil’. Knowing about sex isn’t the same as having sex. And also: SEX ISN’T EVIL, GUYS. Besides, it’s a bit of a risk, if you ask me, turning someone loose in the world if they have no concept of evil. They’re in for a nasty shock and quite possibly some dangerous or exploitative situations. Likewise someone who has been kept in the dark about pregnancy, STIs or abuse. Even if you’re working with some kind of arcane points-based system of morality, how can you get your approval for being without sin just because you don’t know what sin is? That’s like congratulating someone on not eating the cookies they didn’t know were there.</p>
<p>Anyway, that’s enough poptheology. Next: ‘sexualisation’, on which I basically agree with <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/aug/09/stop-this-slut-shaming">Laurie Penny</a> that the word is a “troubling piece of cultural shorthand” which</p>
<blockquote><p>suggests that sexuality is something that is done to young women, rather than something that they can own and control: that they can never be sexual, only sexualised. This is not a helpful message to send to girls as they begin to explore their sexuality.</p>
<p>The moral panic over &#8220;sexualisation&#8221; assumes instead that sex is only ever damaging to young women, and that having sex or behaving sexually must be resisted for as long as possible. The problem is not, however, that young women are &#8220;growing up too fast&#8221; – rather it is that they are growing up to understand that they are erotic commodities, there to be used and abused, shamed if they express legitimate desires of their own, and taught to fear their own bodies.</p></blockquote>
<p>Child sexual behaviour is complex and difficult to discuss, but it <a href="http://www.pediatricsdigest.mobi/content/101/4/e9.full">exists</a>. Children have this weird habit of growing up. And it doesn’t work the way the <strong>Sun</strong> would have it &#8211; every girl is an innocent princess until a few moments past midnight on her 16<sup>th</sup> birthday, at which point it’s A-OK to start slavering over her. Seriously, until 2004 plenty of Page Three girls were 16. There were even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linsey_Dawn_McKenzie">16<sup>th</sup> birthday specials</a> in some other tabloids. Your, er… your double standard is poking out, by the way.</p>
<h3>Ewwww Isn&#8217;t Good Enough</h3>
<p>Critics of broader sex education have done a pretty good job of cosying up to some quarters of the feminist movement, and I’d love to believe that concern over women or children’s wellbeing lay at the heart of the <a href="https://www.education.gov.uk/publications/standard/publicationDetail/Page1/CM%208078">Bailey Review</a> and the media outrage. But it doesn’t. Sexual conservatism is shorthand for a certain kind of morality, and this is a holier-than-thou contest fuelled by the crippling shame and squeamishness about sex that is our shared cultural inheritance. That’s why we feel the need to keep any notion of sex away from children for as long as possible, because on some level, we do think there’s something bad about sex. What other explanation can there be? An otherwise sensible, right-on and feminist former manager of mine once insisted we end a teabreak conversation about how often you should have a sexual health checkup, saying &#8220;Can you just stop talking about it please? It makes me feel all ewwww.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, feeling &#8216;ewwww&#8217; has created a dangerous situation. Without giving children and teenagers a safe space in which to discuss and learn about sex, relationships and sexuality we are creating a vacuum that will be filled by three things: a) whatever their parents choose to tell them; b) all the shit teenagers talk to each other; and c) ideas about sex derived solely from cultural representations of it. Advertising and porn are the big guns here. The version of sex in most porn and advertising isn’t particularly safe, consensual, varied, respectful or even likely to be that much fun (good luck to any women planning on having an orgasm) and the additional messages it peddles about gender identity, power, race and sexual orientation are pretty unhelpful.</p>
<h3>Some Scary Numbers</h3>
<p>As well as the great Tory terror of teenage pregnancy *cue Hammer Horror evil laughter and lightning strike* this is a public health issue. Although last year there was a small decrease in the total number of STIs diagnosed in England, 2010 still clocked up <a href="http://www.hpa.org.uk/NewsCentre/NationalPressReleases/2011PressReleases/110615STIsdeclinefirsttimein10yrs/">418,598 new diagnoses</a>, and the under-25s experience the highest rates of STIs overall. In 2008, the UN reported that globally only 40% of young people aged 15-24 had accurate knowledge about HIV and transmission, while the same group accounted for 45% of all new HIV infections. SRE also presents an opportunity to undermine the stigma faced by people living with HIV through education about transmission without moral judgement. (Stats from <a href="http://unesdoc.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=183281&amp;set=4A5EF7B6_3_66&amp;gp=1&amp;lin=1&amp;ll=1">here</a>.)</p>
<p>This is important, big picture, long term stuff. It’s very hard to unlearn attitudes and prejudices formed in your early life, and not everyone has an <a href="http://www.usborne.com/catalogue/catalogue.aspx?area=S&amp;subcat=SFL&amp;id=62"><strong>Usborne Guide To Growing Up</strong></a> at hand (even that magnificent volume had its blind spots – Miranda reminded me of the ‘kthanxbai!’ box-out on homosexuality…<sup><a href="/2011/11/30/whos-afraid-of-sex-education/#footnote_1_8719" id="identifier_1_8719" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" Ed butting in again: has this been expanded yet?

					<description><![CDATA[World AIDS Day is coming up. UK feminists can help by looking up, and recognising that HIV is a feminist issue on a global scale.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>World AIDS Day</strong> is coming up, and loyal readers will remember Miranda’s <a href="../../../../../2010/12/01/world-aids-day-shoutout/">shoutout</a> last year about why HIV and AIDS is a feminist issue. I’m not going to try and tour all the issues around women and HIV and AIDS, partly because that’s WAY too big for a blog post, but also because I’m not an expert. If that’s what you’re after, this fantastic <a href="http://www.avert.org/women-hiv-aids.htm">resource</a> on women, HIV and AIDS from <strong>Avert</strong> has lots of great information and clear explanations.</p>

<p>So why am I writing this at all? Over the last nine months I’ve gotten interested in the interactions between violence against women, gender roles and HIV, which I confess is mostly down to my job at <a href="http://www.womankind.org.uk/"><strong>Womankind Worldwide</strong></a>.</p>
<p>It struck me that even though I’ve been working with different organisations tackling violence against women in the UK for years, I don’t remember HIV ever being mentioned. It’s just not something I’d ever really thought about. But then, I had also failed to really think about, you know, the rest of the world. This job has been an eye-opener, and I heartily encourage other feminists in the UK, the US, and Western Europe to look up and see what’s happening in the places you <a href="http://www.ibt.org.uk/research_snapshots/snapshot_5.php">don’t see on TV</a>.</p>
<p>“This epidemic unfortunately remains an epidemic of women,” Michel Sidibé, Executive Director of <a href="http://www.unaids.org/en/">UNAIDS</a> said in 2010. At the end of 2009, women accounted for just over half of all adults living with HIV worldwide. In some areas of the world the proportion is much higher, for example in sub-Saharan Africa it is 60%. High levels of HIV among women in these areas are both caused by and causes of violence against women.</p>
<h3>Violence, HIV and Women&#8217;s Health</h3>
<p>Violence against women (you remember, that <a href="http://endviolence.un.org/situation.shtml">really prevalent</a> thing that occurs in all countries in the world) interacts with the HIV epidemic in several cheery ways. This paraphrased from a World Health Organisation <a href="http://www.who.int/gender/violence/vawandhiv/en/">briefing</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sexual abuse in childhood is associated with risk-taking behaviour later in life, increasing an individual’s lifetime risk of contracting HIV.</li>
<li>Rape exposes women to HIV, and the chances of a woman contracting HIV via a forced sexual encounter are probably increased due to the physical trauma.</li>
<li>Violence and fear of violence can stop a woman insisting on condom use or refusing unwanted sex, leaving her with no means of protecting themselves.</li>
<li>Fear of violence, abandonment or stigma can dissuade women from learning their status or from sharing it with their partners, and can also effect HIV control, treatment, and programmes aiming to prevent mother to child transmission.</li>
</ul>
<p>Women&#8217;s health has been the subject of more discussion in development circles in recent years, thanks in large part to the Millennium Development Goals, one of which (<a href="http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/maternal.shtml">MDG5</a>) is focused on maternal health. Women’s health doesn’t begin and end with children though, so I’ve been pleased to see greater recognition of the impact of gender-based violence appearing under <a href="http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/aids.shtml">MDG6</a>, which is dedicated to ending the spread of diseases including HIV infection and the associated illnesses it can cause. Next step, an MDG which is focused on reducing levels of violence against women? Something which has a pretty damaging effect on women&#8217;s health in its own right.</p>
<h3>Ghana</h3>
<p>Through work recently I was lucky enough to meet some of the women and men fighting to reduce violence against women and women’s vulnerability to HIV infection in rural Ghana. Although Ghana isn’t the country worst affected by the HIV epidemic, of the 240,000 HIV+ adults living in Ghana, almost 60% are women. Women in Ghana also experience high levels of violence: 1 in 3 women has experienced some form of physical violence in their lifetime, and 20% of women report that they first experienced sex against their will. (<a title="Womankind, Ghana" href="http://www.womankind.org.uk/what-we-do/where-we-work/ghana/" target="_blank">Stats</a>)</p>
<p>In addition there are a number of harmful traditional practices that contribute to the spread of HIV among women, as well as the cultural acceptability of men having several partners and the right to demand sex. Traditional practices, such as widow inheritance (where a widow is forced to marry her dead husband’s relative), or polygyny (22% of married women are in polygynous unions) increase the likelihood of contracting HIV.</p>
<p>Women living with HIV or AIDS in Ghana also face enormous stigma and go to <a href="http://www.womankind.org.uk/2011/05/the-long-walk-home-how-hiv-infected-women-in-ghana-seeking-support-will-go-to-any-lengths-to-avoid-exposure/">extraordinary lengths</a> to find support and keep their status secret. One reason is that <a href="http://afrol.com/articles/35770">belief in witchcraft is widespread</a>, and HIV infection or death from AIDS-defining illnesses is sometimes blamed on the malign influence of a witch. Incidentally if you’re interested to know more about what happens to women accused of witchcraft in Ghana I recommend watching <a href="http://www.witchesofgambaga.com/trailer/">The Witches of Gambaga</a>:</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/bR5wyAY20-Q?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>‘Witch’ persecution is also alarmingly common <a href="http://www.globalpressinstitute.org/global-news/asia/nepal/violence-plagues-women-accused-witchcraft">in Nepal</a>.</p>
<p>Reading about all this every day at work would get a bit depressing if it wasn’t for our amazing <a href="http://www.womankind.org.uk/what-we-do/where-we-work/ghana/womankind-projects/">partners</a> &#8211; health workers, educators, lawyers and activists &#8211; who are working for change for individuals, and local and global communities. Part of that change is recognition of the complex interactions between HIV and AIDS and violence against women, and the need for targeted, local, gender-sensitive interventions and support. UK feminists can help by looking up, and recognising that HIV is a feminist issue on a global scale.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.hivaware.org.uk/act-aware/support-campaign.php">World AIDS Day</a> is 1 December. Click that link and contact your MP to get better HIV education into classrooms. And do what you can to fight HIV stigma, because a) stigma is a load of oppressive shit; b) it&#8217;s a problem that encompasses a load of feminist issues (for more on this tune in next week &#8211; several of us work in related sectors and will be blogging some WAD-related musings), and c) if you think simply knowing some basic facts about how HIV is contracted is all you can do to &#8220;act aware&#8221;, you&#8217;re wrong. Especially when the media so often fail enormously at reporting either sensitively or accurately on it.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.change.org/petitions/ryanair-stop-selling-your-staff">Ryanair, Stop Selling Your Staff</a> &#8211; female cabin crew staff speak out against the latest round of Page 3-style ads.</li>
<li>A <a href="http://www.good.is/post/how-i-learned-to-hate-transgender-people/">thorough and thoughtful post</a> on transphobic humour tropes, cinema and pop culture in general.</li>
<li>NASA&#8217;s added a new webpage to its site <a href="http://women.nasa.gov/a2i/">to encourage women and girls to get into science and tech</a>! Hooray! We&#8217;re not quite sure about all the PINK FOR LAYDEEZ font, mind, but it&#8217;s great to see.</li>
<li>Two contrasting views on Twilight, both thought-provoking: the Hairpin <a href="http://thehairpin.com/2011/11/our-bella-ourselves">points out the parallels with romantic literature in the Western canon</a>, while i09 <a href="http://io9.com/5860947/in-twilight-breaking-dawn-bella-becomes-a-supernatural-version-of-octomom">is transfixed by &#8216;body panic&#8217; and nightmarishness</a>.</li>
<li>&#8220;We have to trick the consumers of boobsplat into buying books they wouldn&#8217;t normally buy&#8221;: how did we miss this?! Comics Alliance <a href="http://www.comicsalliance.com/2011/10/13/female-characters-superhero-comics">takes the women-comics debate to some creators</a>, with Kieron Gillen, Greg Rucka, Kurt Busiek, G. Willow Wilson, Jeff Parker, Jess Fink, Brandon Graham, Sana Amanat, Jamie McKelvie, Erika Moen and Rachel Edidin sharing ideas.</li>
<li>Finally, here&#8217;s Mary Wollstonecraft&#8217;s face <a href="http://t.co/mmVRkKk5">being projected on the side of the Houses of Parliament</a>. NOTHING ABOUT THIS ISN&#8217;T BADASS.</li>
</ul>
<p>Have a great weekend! The next linkpost will be in December, meaning we will waste no time in being horrendously cheesy, flinging mince pies around, and singing The Waitresses (IT IS OFFICIALLY ALLOWED FROM 1 DECEMBER ONWARDS. YES) but nonetheless continuing the feminist pop culture adventure amid the silliness. :)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It mindboggles me beyond words when I read opinions along the lines of &#8220;HIV/AIDS is not a feminist issue&#8221;.

<p>I&#8217;ve got ribbons, button badges, and a massive pile of red and white iced cupcakes.  &#8220;No ribbon for me, thanks&#8221; is a surprisingly common response, though people seem happy to take a cake without publicising their interest in WAD too openly &#8211; but almost equally prevalent are the people like the woman who murmurs, &#8220;I wear one of these every year, for my aunt&#8221;. HIV carries an incredible amount of stigma even in this country, and it is hugely important that we do everything we can to move the public consciousness on from this.</p>
