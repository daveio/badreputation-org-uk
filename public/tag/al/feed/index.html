										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>A while ago we asked you all what you enjoy doing with your time, and whether you had any thoughts on your hobbies from a gender perspective. A fair few of you got in touch, and following on from Jo&#8217;s post on black metal yesterday, here&#8217;s Al on the soapbox&#8230;</em></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s pretty geeky,&#8221; laughs the guy in the pub. &#8220;I bet you don&#8217;t get many girls doing that!&#8221;</p>
<p>I sigh inwardly. I&#8217;ve just outed myself as a Live-Action Roleplayer, and although he&#8217;s never heard of it before, my drinking partner instantly knows that all larpers are young, socially awkward, computer programmers, and male.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t know what larp is, it&#8217;s often somewhere between <strong>Dungeons &#038; Dragons</strong>, <strong>World of Warcraft</strong> and amateur dramatics. We dress, act and speak as our character &#8211; so mages cast spells using vocals, and combat is resolved using specially-made &#8220;safe&#8221; weapons to hit each other. Sound silly? Damn right, and a great deal of fun too.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been larping for 16 years, and although many systems and genres exist, I mostly enjoy standard &#8220;fantasy&#8221; settings, with warriors, wizards, trolls and the like. A game might be 8 friends playing in a local wood, or several thousand at the largest of the weekend fest events.</p>
<h3>Rules and Regulations</h3>
<p>What&#8217;s it like larping as a woman? Well, there&#8217;s the rules, for a start.</p>
<p>The rules of a system cover combat mechanics, magic systems and character creation. Superficially, for the past 15 years these have been gender neutral. In every system I have played, skill sets are available to any gender &#8211; a woman can play a battle-hardened warrior, just as much as a man can play a one-hit healer.</p>

L has been larping for nearly 20 years. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t have the physical ability, you are far more restricted from playing a tank than if you are a woman,&#8221; she says. &#8220;In my experience, what affects somebody&#8217;s ability the most is personality: a combination of being larger than life, able to take initiative, play your character, and be part of a team.&#8221;</p>
<p>As well as the rules, game creators invent the world into which characters must be placed, and these can come with social prejudices. Usually these are fantastical (&#8220;We hate the unliving!&#8221;) but a few reflect more real-world issues. For example, a society might be defined as &#8220;matriarchal&#8221;, such as many of the Drow from the <a href="http://www.lorientrust.com/Homepage.aspx">Lorien Trust</a> events, or the Tritoni from <a href="http://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/profounddecisions/HomePage?0">Profound Decisions</a>&#8216; Maelstrom system.</p>
<p>Is this a problem? Perhaps. Cultural distinctions add flavour to a game, but by singling them out, other cultures risk being tarred as &#8220;patriarchal&#8221; by default. But players who don&#8217;t wish to interact with these issues in their games can usually opt out.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m fine with <a href="http://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/maelstrom?1">Maelstrom</a>, where there are a couple of cultures with strongly ingrained gender roles,&#8221; says R. &#8220;I can simply avoid playing a member of either culture and there is still a lot of game available. I don&#8217;t want to stop other people roleplaying gender politics just because it&#8217;s not something that interests me.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Young, Geeky Men</h3>
<p>Larpers should be used to stereotypes &#8211; as we&#8217;ve already established, we&#8217;re all single, misanthropic male students, yes? Well, no. Larpers are doctors, lawyers and teachers (and, yes, students and computer programmers). We often started as students, but most of my University friends are still larping, and are happily partnered (usually to each other).</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/larp.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="7906" data-permalink="/2011/10/18/guest-post-thoughts-on-women-in-larp/larp/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/larp.jpg?fit=333%2C500&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="333,500" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;unknown&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="larp" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/larp.jpg?fit=199%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/larp.jpg?fit=333%2C500&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7906" title="larp" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/larp-199x300.jpg?resize=199%2C300" alt="Photo: a young white woman with long blonde hair wearing Roman-style armour. Photo by Flickr user Ara from the Odyssey LRP photo pool on Flickr, shared under Creative Commons licence" width="199" height="300" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/larp.jpg?w=199&amp;ssl=1 199w, https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/larp.jpg?w=333&amp;ssl=1 333w" sizes="(max-width: 199px) 100vw, 199px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>And today, &#8220;male&#8221; is definitely right out. Women play at every level, both as players and game organisers, designers and plot writers.</p>
<p>We have our own stereotypes. We&#8217;re familiar with the Metallica Warrior (rock t-shirt, black jeans, £80 sword) and the Drunken Bum (turns up, drinks beer, smokes rollies).</p>
<p>Women in larp face stereotypes too. The most persistent is the &#8220;Healer Girlfriend&#8221;. She only came because her boyfriend insisted she&#8217;d enjoy it. The description is damning &#8211; you aren&#8217;t a proper character. Worse, your actions are only defined by a man, and you just exist to enhance his weekend (and act as a trophy for him to parade, of course).</p>
<p>R, who has been a key player and organiser in her local group for many years, agrees. &#8220;The stereotype is certainly sometimes accurate, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s fair because applying it is patronising and dangerous. Even to people it does apply to.&#8221;</p>
<p>Healer Girlfriends do exist, albeit briefly. &#8220;I effectively started at the <a href="http://lorientrust.com/EventItem/10-12-18/The_Gathering_2011.aspx">Gathering</a> as a Healer Girlfriend,&#8221; says L. &#8220;In my experience, one of two things quickly happens; either she gets bored and stops playing, or she finds her own game.&#8221; L found her own game, becoming one of the most renowned characters &#8211; and players &#8211; on the field. To call her a Healer Girlfriend now would be laughable.</p>
<p>Another trope is the &#8220;Shelf&#8221; &#8211; the larper in a corset, often generously endowed, and invariably flaunting cleavage for (predominantly) male attention. Characters might resemble the likes of Ce&#8217;Nedra (from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Eddings">David Eddings</a>&#8216;s novels), or Tika Waylan (from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonlance">Dragonlance</a> books) &#8211; or some less salubrious counterpart. Are these roles compatible with calling larp a feminist-friendly sport? Personally, I&#8217;ve always struggled with this. Empowerment does not equate to equality.</p>
<p>Ultimately I must have faith in those who choose to play these parts. We have a responsibility to resist stereotypes, and expect more from our fellow players. In film, the corset-wearing pretty girl is too often a bit-part to the male lead, but no larper writes a character in order to be part of the scenery. In your head, this story is all about <em>you</em>. There&#8217;s a place for these heroes, and a panoply of other characters, pleasant or otherwise &#8211; I could count on one hand the characters I&#8217;ve played that I wouldn&#8217;t detest if I met them in real life.</p>
<h3>Real Life</h3>
<p>Ah yes, real life. We tend to let our hair down at events. Late at night, you&#8217;ll find more than a little drinking, carousing and singing of some shockingly ribald songs round the campfire. That said, larp events are, for most, a safe, welcoming, accepting place to be.</p>
<p>&#8220;I generally find male larpers polite and gentlemanly,&#8221; says P. &#8220;I don&#8217;t remember any instances of sexist behaviour, but then, I don&#8217;t feel particularly vulnerable to that type of abuse, and particularly these days I feel confident to challenge it or ignore it. The main sexist type of behaviour is a tendency towards protectiveness, but I don&#8217;t find that offensive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have had someone try to stop me doing heavy lifting during setup and takedown because it&#8217;s a &#8216;man&#8217;s job&#8217;.&#8221;, says R. &#8220;That&#8217;s hardly related to larp. It&#8217;s a piece of sexism ingrained into society in general, which does need a kicking.&#8221;</p>
<p>Things have changed over the last 10 years, says P. &#8220;The proportion of female to male larpers has improved a lot in that time and changed the dynamics in the field.&#8221;</p>
<p>Larping men seem more liberated. The Gathering is one of the more child-friendly events; of the parents I counted this year pushing prams or herding toddlers, nearly a third of them were men. (Think that&#8217;s not good? Try counting the same thing in your town centre tomorrow). When there&#8217;s no social difference between genders, there&#8217;s no pressure for women to &#8220;stay home&#8221; whilst the men go out and fight the battles. We draw our characters from fantasy, but women aren&#8217;t relegated into playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arwen">The Arwen</a>.<br />

<h3>Playing Your Part</h3>
<p>In larp, you must physically represent &#8211; <em>physrep</em> &#8211; your character. Costume, weaponry and armour is available to turn anyone into a warrior or a wizard. However, a tall, balding, overweight man can put on a pair of pointy ears and call himself an elf, but he&#8217;ll be a tall, balding, overweight elf none the less.</p>
<p>Does this restrict a woman&#8217;s game? In other forms of gaming, there&#8217;s nothing to stop you playing a character of another gender, but this is much harder in larp. Effectively portraying another gender takes more care, physically and socially, than most larpers are able to put in over the course of a weekend in a tent. The easy option is to go &#8220;panto&#8221; &#8211; fake breasts and falsetto, or badly-drawn beards and that testicle-airing stance of the &#8220;man&#8221;. Such characters make me wince. They rely on stereotypes &#8211; invariably negative &#8211; that are almost always drawn from our out-of-character world. Not only offensive, but immersion-breaking to boot.</p>
<p>That isn&#8217;t to say that gender-reversal can&#8217;t be done well &#8211; it can. But for the most part, a woman can only play female characters. Does that really matter? I don&#8217;t think so. All larpers make sacrifices over what they can play &#8211; the overweight can never play svelte, the clumsy can never play jugglers, the tone-deaf can never play bards. P says she has never felt restricted in her character choices by her gender. &#8220;Physical ability has been a much bigger restriction for me,&#8221; she says.</p>
<h3>I Love Larp</h3>
<p>Writing that last paragraph made me remember why I love larp so much. There are so many other things we <em>can</em> play. The recluse can play a talented diplomat; the coward can play the hero. And more pertinently, women can play characters with real power. There is no glass ceiling. A woman playing a warrior will be judged and accepted not on her gender, but on how well she can wield a sword and shield. In <a href="http://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/odyssey?4">Profound Decision&#8217;s <strong>Odyssey</strong> campaign</a>, when a woman was elected Autocrator of Carthage &#8211; a bloodthirsty and vengeful nation in-game &#8211; nobody gave a damn about her gender, merely whether she could deliver us the victory we so deeply craved over our arch-nemeses, the foul dogs of Rome.</p>
<p>So what does it matter if you can only play women? If you&#8217;re judged by your actions, not your gender, not a jot.</p>
<p>Introduce yourself as head of a guild, and you will rarely see that condescending attitude so common in the real world that shouts, &#8220;Gosh, and you&#8217;re a woman as well! How very clever.&#8221;</p>
<p>Take up a battleaxe, gather your spell cards, ally with your foes and betray your friends. There&#8217;s a thousand others in this field who don&#8217;t care if you&#8217;re male, female or neither. Sharpen your wit, hold the line, and cross swords, for they&#8217;ll show you no quarter.</p>
