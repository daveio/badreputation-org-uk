					<description><![CDATA[If I had a time machine I would go back through history, picking up awesome chicks and bringing them back to the present...]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If I had a time machine, I would go back through history, picking up awesome chicks and bringing them back to the present. I would finally be able to giggle with glee as Victorians tried to work out how the tiny people got inside the TV and ancient Greeks marvelled at printed books, not to mention what showing them the internet might do! There are certain women, certain amazing icons, who would fit right into the modern world. They would be able to work, love, live and breathe, far away from the limitations placed on them in their own time. Here are five of them. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, 2012 is no utopia &#8211; we still have our battles and our injustices &#8211; but compared to any other time in history, the 21st century is a pretty awesome place for ladies.</p>
<h3>Sappho</h3>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/sappho.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="10786" data-permalink="/2012/05/02/guest-post-if-i-had-a-time-machine-five-historical-women-who-would-thrive-in-the-21st-century/sappho/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/sappho.jpg?fit=300%2C240&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="300,240" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="sappho" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/sappho.jpg?fit=300%2C240&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/sappho.jpg?fit=300%2C240&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-10786 alignright" title="sappho" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/sappho.jpg?resize=270%2C216" alt="Sappho on an Attic red-figure vase c.470 BC. Image via Wikipedia, shared under fair use guidelines." width="270" height="216" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Sappho gave birth to two of my favourite things: lyric poetry and lesbianism. Born in 630 BC on the island of Lesbos, Sappho had a pretty good life, considering her gender. She was rich, talented and of good social standing. Her poetry, which she performed with a lyre (she invented a new subtype of the instrument, and the plectrum, of all things) was well-respected. She had her face on coins and on vases. But she was pretty lonely. The girls in her circle (which was either a religious order, something like a preparatory class or simply a gathering of women, depending on which scholars you believe) would all leave her when they married, and when she fell in love with them, she knew that they would inevitably part. She probably never married herself (accounts differ, but most <a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/restless1.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="10787" data-permalink="/2012/05/02/guest-post-if-i-had-a-time-machine-five-historical-women-who-would-thrive-in-the-21st-century/restless1/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/restless1.jpg?fit=500%2C281&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="500,281" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="restless1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/restless1.jpg?fit=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/restless1.jpg?fit=500%2C281&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-10787 alignright" title="restless1" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/restless1-300x168.jpg?resize=243%2C136" alt="Still from the Buffy episode Restless. A caucasian blonde woman is lying on her stomach, looking over her shoulder at her back, which has Greek script painted onto her flesh in black ink.

<p>If I could go back and get her in my time machine, I&#8217;d sign her up to a dating site, put in a DVD of the <strong>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</strong> episode “Restless” (which features a lesbian writing Sappho&#8217;s poetry on her lover&#8217;s back) and explain to her that when she met the right lady, she would be able to date her, live with her, and in some parts of the world, marry her.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d show her this video, of Ellen and Portia&#8217;s wedding:</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/aWgvqruYdbQ?rel=0" frameborder="0" width="420" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>And I would be so excited because, in this time of technology, the beautiful poetry she would no doubt produce, probably about the woman she would eventually meet online, would never be lost and never be forgotten.</p>
<h3>Ada Lovelace</h3>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Ada_lovelace.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="10788" data-permalink="/2012/05/02/guest-post-if-i-had-a-time-machine-five-historical-women-who-would-thrive-in-the-21st-century/ada_lovelace/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Ada_lovelace.jpg?fit=225%2C310&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="225,310" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Ada_lovelace" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Ada_lovelace.jpg?fit=217%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Ada_lovelace.jpg?fit=225%2C310&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-10788 alignright" title="Ada_lovelace" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Ada_lovelace-217x300.jpg?resize=195%2C270" alt="Victorian image of Ada Lovelace in a purple satin gown, holding a fan delicately. Image via Wikipedia, shared under Fair Use guidelines." width="195" height="270" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Ada_lovelace.jpg?w=217&amp;ssl=1 217w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Ada_lovelace.jpg?w=225&amp;ssl=1 225w" sizes="(max-width: 195px) 100vw, 195px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Ada Lovelace was a genius. Born in 1815 in London, she was the product of very short-lived marriage of mad, bad asshole poet Byron and staunchly moral abolitionist Anne Isabelle Milbanke. Schooled in mathematics from an early age, at the behest of a mother desperately trying to prevent her from turning out like her father, Ada began corresponding with important intellectuals on a variety of subjects while she was still in her teens, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage">Charles Babbage</a>. The notes she included with her translation of an Italian mathematician&#8217;s article about Babbage&#8217;s Difference Engine were revolutionary and contained the very first working programming language, leading her to be seen as history&#8217;s first computer programmer.</p>
<p>If I could go to the Victorian period and pick her up, I&#8217;d go for the bright young Ada, before the affairs and the gambling. I&#8217;d show her iphones and laptops and cash machines, making it clear to her that none of this would exist without her. I&#8217;d take her to the Apple store and show her an iPad. I&#8217;d open a browser and let her google until she thought her head would explode with the sheer scope of it all. Then I&#8217;d go to the Google careers page and make her <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w887NIa_V9w">fill out an application</a>.</p>
<h3>Emily Dickinson</h3>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/emilydickinson.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="10789" data-permalink="/2012/05/02/guest-post-if-i-had-a-time-machine-five-historical-women-who-would-thrive-in-the-21st-century/emilydickinson/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/emilydickinson.jpg?fit=220%2C273&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="220,273" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="emilydickinson" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/emilydickinson.jpg?fit=220%2C273&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/emilydickinson.jpg?fit=220%2C273&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-10789" title="emilydickinson" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/emilydickinson.jpg?resize=220%2C273" alt="Black and white portrait photo of a young Emily Dickinson. She is pale with dark hair tied severely back from her face, and wears a dark coloured high necked dress. Image via Wikipedia, shared under Fair Use guidelines." width="220" height="273" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Born in 1830, in Amherst, Massachusetts, Emily Dickinson was not a famous poet during her lifetime. She was not a famous anything during her lifetime. </p>
<p>Known by her neighbours as an eccentric who dressed in white and rarely left the house, she wrote almost two thousand poems, only ten of which were ever published while she was living. Her fascination with mortality, due to numerous personal tragedies, along with her concise, free verse style, made her work a little too ahead of its time to be appreciated until much later. She was an avid letter writer and by the end of her life she was communicating almost exclusively via the written word.</p>
<p>If I could go back, I&#8217;d whisk Emily away from the early 1860s, when she was a fiercely creative thirty-something. I&#8217;d set her up in a nice apartment with a pretty garden – little known fact: Emily Dickinson was much better known for her gardening than for her writing in her lifetime – and hand her a shiny new laptop. After a hopefully brief, not too infuriating tutorial on the technological revolution, I&#8217;d <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgNIIUD_oQg&amp;list=UU_UWaQiCQi4S5O2LbU-SK5w&amp;index=4&amp;feature=plcp">introduce her to Facebook and Skype</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d show her how easy it is to instantly communicate with individuals from all over the globe and all walks of life whenever she pleased. I&#8217;d explain to her that now, with these tools at her fingertips, she could have her precious solitude without sacrificing the social stimulation she clearly craved. Next, I&#8217;d direct her attention to the numerous writers&#8217; communities online. I&#8217;d show her the pages and pages of poetry &#8211; and the range of quality, from emo teens to professional writers. I&#8217;d encourage her to get involved and post daily. Finally one of the most under-appreciated poets of the nineteenth century would be able share her thoughts, feelings and art with like-minded individuals without ever having to leave her desk.</p>
<h3>Amelia Earhart</h3>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/AE.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="10790" data-permalink="/2012/05/02/guest-post-if-i-had-a-time-machine-five-historical-women-who-would-thrive-in-the-21st-century/ae/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/AE.jpg?fit=338%2C447&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="338,447" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="AE" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/AE.jpg?fit=226%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/AE.jpg?fit=338%2C447&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10790" title="AE" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/AE-226x300.jpg?resize=226%2C300" alt="Photo showing Amelia Earheart in overalls standing on part of a plane. She is smiling. Image via Wikipedia, shared under Fair Use guidelines." width="226" height="300" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/AE.jpg?w=226&amp;ssl=1 226w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/AE.jpg?w=338&amp;ssl=1 338w" sizes="(max-width: 226px) 100vw, 226px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Amelia Earhart, born in Kansas in 1897, was as ballsy and independent as they come. She wanted to fly, so she flew. She wanted to fly all the way across the Atlantic, so she signed up to command a flight piloted by men in a project funded by a rich woman. She wanted to do the trip for real, solo, and a few years later, she did. In 1937, she decided she wanted to be the first to fly around the world, and sadly, this was where it all went wrong. She disappeared in the air, having flown almost the entire way around the world with only a navigator accompanying her. There are too many theories about how and why this happened to mention, but the most accepted explanation is mistakes were made, preparation was shoddy and she ran out of fuel over the ocean, plummeting to a watery grave.</p>
<p>If I could go back and get her, I&#8217;d go back to the early Thirties, and pick her up after her solo flight across the Atlantic, before she was forced to endorse product after product just to maintain her high profile, and before the press began their obligatory backlash, calling her flying chops into question. </p>
<p>I&#8217;d sit her down on my bed, fire up my laptop, and show her YouTube videos of women flying commercial flights and flying for fun and flying as fighter pilots. I&#8217;d show her this video of the Women In Aviation conference in San Diego:</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/OQNJiJj8ly8?rel=0" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>Most importantly, I&#8217;d tell her that flying is now safe. The technology has caught up with her dreams and it is very unlikely, in the age of GPS and state of the art air traffic control, that what happened to her would happen now. I would also let her know that now, it is possible to set off to circumnavigate the globe before breakfast and arrive home in time for tea!</p>
<h3>Margaret Cavendish</h3>

Yep, really. In a time when most women would never think about trying to write a word, let alone publishing under their own name, Cavendish was a famous and controversial writer. </p>
<p>Her critics complained about her spelling and grammar as much as they did about her writing at all. They also criticised her outlandish style of dress, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Cavendish,_Duchess_of_Newcastle-upon-Tyne">calling</a> her “mad, conceited, and ridiculous” &#8211; but her originality, paired with her keen interest in and interpretation of early science, made her popular.</p>
<p>If I could journey back to the 17th century, I would go to 1668, the year <strong>The Blazing World</strong> was published, and I&#8217;d bring Margaret back here. The first thing I would do is encourage her to get tested for dyslexia, as some scholars have suggested that this would have accounted for her terrible spelling and grammar. I&#8217;d show her women delivering lectures on TED about robotics and neuroscience:</p>

<p>I&#8217;d get her an application for Oxford University and introduce her to Microsoft Word complete with the lifesaving blessing that is spell check. Once she was accepted at Oxford, she&#8217;d get all sorts of support for her dyslexia, and shiny equipment. She would excel at all her subjects, even the ones that weren&#8217;t invented in her time. I&#8217;d watch her study, graduate, write and publish, and then become an academic, scientist, writer or all three. I&#8217;d sit back, hope for another science fiction novel, and smile smugly when she cured cancer.</p>
<p>Sadly, there ain&#8217;t no such thing as time travel. It&#8217;s likely there never will be. But I can wonder and I can dream. And I can use thought experiments like this to remind myself I have the freedom to love whomever I choose, aim as high as I choose, live however I choose and be respected for it. How very lucky I was to be born in 1984.</p>

<p>Following on from <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/12/15/alpha-malaise/" title="A link to an
article about masculinity on Bad Reputation - a feminist pop culture adventure">Sarah C&#8217;s blogpost yesterday</a>, I wanted to ask: who decides what it is to &#8220;be a man&#8221;? And why is the answer vital to improving things for women?</p>
<p>This is not just about Alpha Males, but our entire definition of masculinity (and therefore what we&#8217;re telling boys and men they should aim to be). We can talk about being a responsible adult, but how is that different from &#8216;manly&#8217;? </p>
<p>We haven&#8217;t moved on very much from celebrating men as muscle-bound warriors, from equating manliness with <em>physical</em> strength. Nerds are not manly. Thin, &#8216;weak&#8217; guys are not manly. The efficient office worker is not &#8216;manly&#8217;. The patient father is not praised with &#8220;What a man!&#8221; Anyone with the wrong body shape can never qualify.</p>
<p>Manliness also requires independence: you&#8217;re not a successful man if you live in your Mother&#8217;s basement, but men who own motorbikes or fast cars are sexy. It goes beyond this, though. You&#8217;re not manly if you&#8217;re ruled primarily by tender emotions, or &#8220;under the thumb&#8221; of a woman, or &#8211;</p>
<p>Sorry, I just can&#8217;t keep this up. It&#8217;s such utter, utter bullshit. The short answer seems to be: you&#8217;re not a man unless you control your own destiny. If others are in charge of you, or you submit to them, then they are above you on the Manliness Scale.</p>
<p>And we wonder why the entire planet is in danger.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s as though the capability to fight and take &#8211; and therefore provide &#8211; is still the only measure of what makes a man. Male aggression is not popular in modern society (outside of sports, boardrooms and the army) but Sarah C referred to some websites yesterday which celebrate a particularly horrible version of poisonous alpha male tropes. Their vision consists of controlling your women (multiple), being in command, being admired for being powerful, and taking it easy while your slaves do the work because you&#8217;re the big man.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty strange to see that this still exists in an allegedly modern country. These men seem to think they can be less powerless in life if they take imagined power from women around them. A big part of it lies in succeeding specifically <em>because</em> you have lowered a woman&#8217;s power from a perceived higher place. Femininity is seen as making men weak, and women are assumed to be always less powerful (making any example of them EVER overruling the alpha an unacceptable demonstration of the alpha&#8217;s weakness.)</p>
<p>So why is this commanding behaviour not only acceptable, respected, sought-after, but the definition of masculine prowess?</p>
<p>Some sources believe it&#8217;s because <a href="http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2010/09/when_was_the_last_time_you_got.html">fighting is the one thing you can&#8217;t fake.</a> It&#8217;s also the action which overrules all others: it doesn&#8217;t matter how deserving, wise or honourable you are, someone with a bigger gun can take it all away. So maybe it&#8217;s about security, and therefore defence of loved ones, rather than the more pessimistic approach of valuing someone primarily for their ability to attack.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s interesting is that this Conan image comes more from the media and movies than reality. A quick poll of some female friends found that they mainly think &#8220;manly&#8221; means having <em>Values, Character, Responsibility</em>&#8230; behaviours which suggest you are not just a boy in adult clothes. The change is from a child to an adult, not to being more <em>male</em> than before.</p>
<p>But the images and lessons boys receive from TV and cinema simply cannot equate maturity with manliness unless the man can also kick the ass of everyone onscreen. And be totally 100% heterosexual, of course. (In the same poll, one woman said she&#8217;d think less of a man if he wasn&#8217;t physically stronger than her, so it&#8217;s not all one-sided.) Even here, &#8216;feminine&#8217; qualities are seen as taking away from a man&#8217;s masculinity. And since &#8216;feminine&#8217; is deemed inseparable from a woman&#8217;s perfect role of being a (usually married) mother, that means men are deemed less manly if they show any nurturing behaviour towards kids, are emotionally sensitive, etc etc oh god this is depressing.</p>
<p>Ultimately, masculinity is bound up with <em>individual</em> heroism instead of having to rely on others, and that&#8217;s a dangerous place to be.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a sad trend for feminism that men are judged on what they <strong>do</strong>, and women are judged on how they <strong>look</strong>, but the male side of that is not as enabling as it appears. The target for masculinity has to include muscle, mastery and money. A man’s worth (as a &#8220;successful&#8221; male and especially as relationship material) is very closely linked to his money. Not just the prestige of the job, but how far up the status ladder of it he is. Success and potential future success are what are really being measured, in whatever field. And it IS about wealth; that&#8217;s why status <em>symbols</em> work. They represent the money, and therefore the power, or his capability and drive to get power.</p>
<p>Who are the male role models on TV? Bling-laden hard men rappers surrounded by girls, secret agents who win every fight, footballers and movie stars. All of whom are alpha males who get the girls and status (and money). Individual parents might offer better role models linked to how to be manly, but &#8220;society&#8221; doesn&#8217;t. Even the &#8220;lad&#8217;s mags&#8221; of the 1990s like <strong>FHM</strong> and <strong>Loaded</strong> <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/press/why-are-mens-magazines-being-left-on-the-shelf-2142714.html">aren&#8217;t connecting with what men feel is right for their lives</a>.</p>
<p>Despite all this, the problem is nothing compared to what women face when society tells them what it thinks &#8216;feminine&#8217; is. That still must include sexual issues in a way that &#8216;masculine&#8217; doesn&#8217;t, as well as passivity/submission. And for all the harm that men feeling unneeded may bring, reclaiming feminism from its Bad Rep is a more urgent issue &#8211; <strong>but it&#8217;s not unrelated</strong>. We need ways for men to behave better towards women without feeling less masculine. The strict mandate to never appear as &#8216;weak&#8217; as a woman is <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/1031">a foundation of male violence</a>.</p>
<p>The message needs to change. We need to be saying that a man is valued if he behaves <em>well</em>, with compassion and thought and honour. The only medium that counts in bringing messages like this to the public is television, and that&#8217;s why pop culture is so crucial. Less &#8216;lone white male avenger&#8217; shows, more balanced, nuanced depictions of heroism. We won&#8217;t get it from retail advertisers (who want you to believe you need money, items and to be having constant fun or you are a failure). We need it to come from pop culture, and to reach children and young adults in ways which seem natural and obvious.</p>
<p>There is hope. As well as the attitudes of real individuals in the surveys I mentioned earlier, some websites and magazines are also looking at the problem. One very interesting example is <a href="http://goodmenproject.com/">The Good Men Project</a>, which launched recently. They seem to be asking precisely the same question I have: what&#8217;s the difference between &#8220;being a man&#8221; and &#8220;being a GOOD man&#8221;? And why is there such a huge potential difference at all? (Also: high-five to that site for genuinely exploring how to get comfortable with masculinity in a way which benefits the individual and society, and so far not setting up feminism as any kind of block to that.)<sup><a href="/2010/12/16/big-dog/#footnote_0_82" id="identifier_0_82" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" Ed&rsquo;s Tiny Note, Added In 2013: It would seem The Good Men Project has since made quite the effort to distance itself from feminists, and has had more of its fair share of problematic moments.

<p>While men are told that compromising, accepting help or having anything in common with a woman makes them weak, everyone needs this harmful definition of masculinity to change.</p>
