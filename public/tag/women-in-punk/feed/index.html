										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There were several predictable bones to pick with last week’s <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/feb/26/nme-60-editors-favourite-covers"><strong>Guardian</strong> piece</a> in which former editors of the <strong>New Musical Express</strong> selected their most noteworthy covers. The feature left out a lot of the former <strong>Accordion Weekly</strong>’s history, notably anything prior to the late 1970s, but what struck me most about the covers chosen was the disparity between the first one and the last. The <strong>NME</strong>&#8216;s <a href="http://velvetcoalmine.wordpress.com/2009/04/17/sleeping-with-the-nme-how-the-british-music-press-picked-up-a-dose-of-the-crap/">decline</a> from a vital and thoughtful read to a list-heavy vehicle for mutual backscratching seemed to be reflected in the journey from Pennie Smith&#8217;s 1979 cover shot of the Slits, then a relatively obscure and resolutely uncommercial dub-punk girl-gang, dressed in mud and loincloths, to, thirty years on, a cover featuring the monarch of manufactured mediocrity <a href="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/2/24/1330114355043/NME-covers---Simon-Cowell-002.jpg">in a headshot</a> which, to quote a commenter, makes the paper look like the <strong>Radio Times</strong>.</p>
<p>Smith’s photographs of the Slits mudlarking in the grounds of their Surrey recording studio became a defining image of the band, notably through being used on the cover of their debut album <strong>Cut</strong>. This article looks briefly at the controversy generated by the images themselves, and how it relates to subsequent and current presentation of women in the UK music press.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/NME-covers-The-Slits-001.jpg?resize=460%2C654" alt="Image copyright Pennie Smith/the NME, shared under Fair Use guidelines. A black and white image showing The Slits swinging from trees smeared with mud." width="460" height="654" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h3>Under the Cover</h3>
<p>The space provided by punk for female as well as well as male self-expression and emancipation can be overstated – see Helen Reddington’s <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=l5l4PiOfYTcC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=helen%20reddington%20lost%20women%20rock&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=helen%20reddington%20lost%20women%20rock&amp;f=false">research</a> on the persistence of entrenched chauvinist and sexist attitudes – but the Slits were unarguably, in the words of Caroline Coon, ‘driving a coach and various guitars straight through&#8230; the concept of The Family and female domesticity’. One of the first prominent bands to spring from the art-squats of punk west London, the Slits’ early music and performance was a squall of untrained, instinctive energy, and their casually confrontational appearance and behavior drew negative reactions ranging from media disapproval to violent hostility. Although tending to recoil from any overtly political espousal of feminism, the band bluntly advocated female independence and empowerment, encouraging girls to form bands and to define themselves by their actions rather than their relationships.</p>
<blockquote><p>‘We’re just not interested in questions about Women’s Liberation&#8230; You either think chauvinism’s shit or you don’t. We think it’s shit&#8230; Girls shouldn’t hang around with people who give them aggro about what they want to do. If they do they’re idiots.’<br />
&#8211; <strong><a href="http://www.punk77.co.uk/graphics/slits/carolinecoonpage4.jpg">Slits guitarist Viv Albertine, June 1977</a></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The image on the <strong>Cut</strong> cover fits into the Slits’ more general disruptions and subversions of accepted feminine tropes, including their punk-inspired adoption of fetish and bondage gear as deconstructed parts of an everyday wardrobe, and their plain-speaking on sex and sexuality. The band’s proto-Goth contemporary Siouxsie Sioux remarked that they &#8216;weren&#8217;t glamorous, they were very earthy&#8217;. The Slits’ aesthetic and behaviour onstage and off was repeatedly referenced in terms of wildness and ferocity, reinforcing their performance of an exoticised, &#8216;untamed&#8217; sexuality, which on the album cover clashed with the band’s bucolic backdrop to create an arresting mash-up of English Rose and Amazon.</p>
<h3>Covered in Controversy</h3>
<p>Having in their earlier career declined several offers from labels intent on exploiting the novelty aspect of a girl band, and battled with industry men who expected female musicians to ‘kowtow or flutter your eyelids’, the band’s stated aim for the cover of their debut was to &#8216;show that women could be sexy without dressing in a prescribed way. Sexy, in a natural way, and naked, without being pornographic&#8217;. Their bassist Tessa Pollitt described the cover as ‘one of the most liberating things I have done’, claiming that the band were ‘celebrating the freedoms we were creating’. The cover divided opinion at the time of its release, dismissed by some as a cynically sexualized ploy, and ridiculed by others because of the group’s deviation from a conventionally desirable body shape (Smith’s photographs were taken at a point when the Slits had succumbed to the regular eating and sleeping hours of studio life, away from the chaotic amphetamine-fuelled living to which they’d grown accustomed, leaving them looking softer and more rounded than expected by those policing punk angularity &#8211; a particularly frustrating slant of attack given punk’s early attempts to transcend these kind of prescriptive aesthetics).</p>
<p>Music writer Vivien Goldman embraced the <strong>Cut</strong> cover as a defiant reclamation of the female body, and Pauline Black, who went on to form 2-Tone band the Selecter, saw it as ‘so joyous, innocent and natural that it just seemed like a celebration of womanhood rather than any cheap titillation’. It still has the power to spark disagreement: Roni Sarig in <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29050.The_Secret_History_of_Rock"><strong>The Secret History Of Rock</strong></a> waxes lyrical that the cover ‘confounded notions of sexuality and civility and positioned the group as modern primitive feminist rebels &#8211; girls not afraid to be natural, sexual and formidable’, while the author of the <a href="http://www.punk77.co.uk/groups/slitsdiscography.htm">Punk77</a> website makes the counter-claim that the image in fact undermines Sarig’s idea ‘that they were one of the first all female bands to avoid being &#8216;marketed as sex objects&#8217;&#8230; They had their tits out. For instance I was 16 when this album came out&#8230; I and many others didn&#8217;t see it as anything but three nudes on a cover!’</p>
<h3>Bad Cover Versions</h3>
<p>As for the women-in-the-music-press discussion, so far so same-old. Cazz Blase&#8217;s <a href="http://www.thefword.org.uk/features/2012/02/women_and_the_music_press">recent article</a> on the UK music press maintained that it is marketed, sold and created primarily by and for men. The <strong>NME</strong>, which in 2009 appointed Krissi Murison as its first female editor, is actually not too bad as far as the balance of genders among its staff goes &#8211; although the relative positions women occupy, and how this translates to coverage and presentation of female musicians, are different debates. In 2010, Aoife Barry gave <a href="http://www.theantiroom.com/2010/11/16/what-the-boys-said-gender-imbalance-in-music-magazines/">an overview</a> of the underrepresentation of female musicians on the covers of music magazines, emphasizing the egregiousness of Q in particular:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why not count how many women you can see on the covers of <strong>Q</strong> magazine this year (two solo covers: Cheryl Cole and Lady Gaga – and two group shots: Amy Winehouse and Lily Allen together in a group shot; and Lady Gaga again in a group shot). The reason I mention <strong>Q</strong> is that the response to ‘there aren’t enough women on the covers of music magazines’ is often ‘but that’s because it reflects the amount of women working in music&#8217;. This is not true – particularly in the case of <strong>Q</strong>, which covers mainstream rock, indie and pop music. In fact, the female musicians it covers are usually from the pop arena. And you cannot argue that the pop realm is oestrogen-free.</p></blockquote>
<p>While, as Barry admits, ‘there may not be a great conspiracy to keep women off the covers of music magazines and give them minimal coverage on the inside pages’, it is frequently the case that when women are featured, so is a latent or overt sexualizing of them which does not affect their male counterparts to the same degree.</p>
<p>One has to factor in, of course, the degree to which coverage of bands will depend upon commercial trends in rock and indie; the musical greywash which occurred under late Britpop saw a sidelining of female artists which appeared to reach its dull conclusion in the post-Libertines profusion of almost invariably male ‘landfill indie’ groups. This connection is made explicit in <strong>Q</strong>’s concern with catering for a target demographic supposedly ‘inspired by the rock&#8217;n&#8217;roll swagger of Liam, Noel, Blur and the whole Britpop scene’, a remit which perhaps explains last October’s <a href="http://covers.q4music.com/Item.aspx?pageNo=6179&amp;year=2011">gobsmackingly retrograde</a> Kasabian cover while doing little to excuse it.</p>
<h3>Covering Up?</h3>
<p>Smith’s shot of the Slits in all their unphotoshopped glory differs from <strong>Q</strong>&#8216;s cover in several obvious respects – its subjects muddy rather than glossy, wearing unselfconscious grins rather than careful high-maintenance pouts, and, crucially, having shaped the image via their own concept and direction rather than following a top-down marketing or editorial strategy. It’s true that the NME has never been an impregnable bastion of women&#8217;s liberation – even on that Slits cover, there’s the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_Three">dubious </a>strapline referring to them as the paper’s ‘Page One girls’ – and I&#8217;m sure that just as many readers saw the cover as wank material as chin-strokingly believed it to be &#8216;confounding notions of sexuality and civility&#8217;. A happy few may even have done both. But the upfront disheveled self-confidence the Slits display is still striking and even looks quaint in an era where the last comparable Empowered and Liberated woman on an <strong>NME</strong> cover was, who, Beth Ditto? Whose appearance, and the ensuing <a href="http://www.bigfatblog.com/beth-ditto-cover-nme">debates</a> on whether it constituted &#8217;empowerment&#8217; or &#8216;objectification&#8217;, proved that non-standard naked women were still controversial in 2007.</p>
<p>Cazz Blaze, citing the music press’ recession-induced drift towards conservatism, characterized by an increasing reliance on sponsorship and advertising, predicts little room for improvement in opportunities for women to express their emancipation rather than their objectification. Her characterization of online music publications like <a href="http://thequietus.com/">The Quietus</a> as more conscientious about women as artists, readers, and writers, is an interesting point. It ties in with the idea of the internet as a space where female engagement with music can be expressed and explored without being dismissed as exclusively sex-centred or derided as juvenile inanity, and where female musicians themselves can harness the internet’s capacity for unregulated self-expression and audience interaction, <a href="http://wearsthetrousers.com/2008/11/outraged-amanda-palmer-fans-mount-rebellyon/">frequently</a> in ways which circumvent or combat industry and media-led imperatives on how women are meant to appear.</p>
<p>Despite the internet’s progressive potential for allowing female artists control over their own presentation, the reception of and reaction to that presentation remains beyond their control. After punk, and after riot grrl, the jury is still out on the political uses of the naked female form, and on their degree of effectiveness. Do images like those of Ditto and the Slits deconstruct and demystify the female body? How constructively do they inform debates on body image and female sexuality? In the eyes of observers male and female, are they validating alternative ways of being attractive, or are they merely putting forward an alternative cut of meat?</p>
<p>And, of course, should we be concerned at all with how a musician looks as opposed to how she &#8211; or he &#8211; sounds?</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Cheers, Poly. Rest in peace.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was just waving goodbye to sixteen when I discovered <strong>X-Ray Spex</strong>, and I discovered them in the least cool-cred of ways: via a covermount CD I got with <strong>Kerrang!</strong> magazine, which I bought semi-religiously at the time. </p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/spex.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="5147" data-permalink="/2011/04/26/a-little-less-day-glo-goodbye-poly-styrene/spex/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/spex.jpg?fit=250%2C252&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="250,252" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="spex" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/spex.jpg?fit=250%2C252&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/spex.jpg?fit=250%2C252&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/spex.jpg?resize=250%2C252" alt="cover photo art for Germ Free Adolescents by X-Ray Spex: a row of test tubes, each containing a band member. Band members wear day glo, bright clothing." title="spex" width="250" height="252" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5147" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/spex.jpg?w=250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/spex.jpg?w=150&amp;ssl=1 150w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>This CD was part of the <em>Kerrang! Hometaping</em> series, in which various leading lights of the hard rock scene, invariably men (do shout me if this has changed, as I have since given up on<em> K!</em>, but my optimism&#8217;s economy-size) compiled mixtapes of their favourite tracks past and present. This one, compiled by Casey Chaos of parental-guidance-sticker-collecting Cali-punk-metal outfit <strong>Amen</strong>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Various+Artists/Kerrang!+Hometaping,+Volume+2:+Refuse+Music">wasn&#8217;t a bad mix, looking at it now</a>. For the most part. </p>
<p>But it was the presence of <strong>I Am A Cliché</strong> on the tracklist that put the CD on regular rotation on my Discman.  That track stood out, sparking nicely off The Distillers and The Adverts (the sum total of female input, there) and kicking defiantly <em>against</em> the roll-your-eyes-or-lose-your-lunch misogyny of <em>Let&#8217;s Fuck </em>by the Murderdolls (at least the CD had range). And the more I listened to <strong>Poly Styrene</strong>&#8216;s life-affirming shouts, the more alert I felt to the complete shit that passed (passes!) for acceptable attitudes to gender in some of the rest of the bands on the CD, in the mag, in my music collection, in general. (For that jarringly educational juxtaposition, Casey&#8217;s at least to be thanked.)</p>
<p>From there it was a short leap to the rest of <strong>Germ Free Adolescents</strong>. Nobody forgets the first time they hear the crisp, sing-song pronouncement that opens <strong>Oh Bondage, Up Yours! </strong>: <em>Some people think little girls should be seen and not heard, but <strong>I </strong>think&#8230;</em> (when I set up this blog, I entered it as the mousefloat text description for the Music Box category on the sidebar).  Every time I hear it, I feel that emphasis on <strong>but <em>I</em> think&#8230;</strong></em> reverb through me: powerful, unabashed and instantly compelling. And funny. &#8220;Playing with words and ideas, having a laugh about everything, sending it up&#8221;, as Poly herself <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/the-return-of-punks-first-lady-1027858.html">put it</a> to the <strong>Independent</strong> in 1998 (this approach was arguably worlds away from Amen&#8217;s bloodied-up on-stage histrionics, so it&#8217;s perhaps faintly ironic she made Casey&#8217;s list of hometaped heroes, but anyway).</p>

For me, it&#8217;s the loss of a personal hero &#8211; she formed the Spex in 1978 by throwing an ad in <strong>Melody Maker</strong> with a header demanding the attention of <em>YOUNG PUNX WHO WANT TO STICK IT TOGETHER</em>.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s on record, in a recent interview with <strong>6Music</strong> <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-13193968">quoted in her BBC obituary</a>, as saying, &#8220;I know I&#8217;ll probably be remembered for <strong>Oh Bondage Up Yours!</strong>&#8230; I&#8217;d like to be remembered for something a bit more spiritual.&#8221;</p>
<p>For me, the impact of X-Ray Spex actually <em>was</em> akin to something spiritual. Poly threw into stark, uncompromising relief the lack of female voices normally in play in mainstream rock, in <strong>Kerrang!</strong>, and so on. She made me wonder, for the first time, what <em><strong>I </strong>thought</em> about that. (Clue: it ends in &#8220;up yours&#8221;.) So I think in a way, although the Spex&#8217;s one album probably will always be her most famous music, that&#8217;s okay. </p>
<p>Cheers, Poly. Here&#8217;s to you. Rest in peace. (Say hi to <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/10/21/silence-is-a-rhythm-too/"><strong>Ari Up</strong></a> for us.) The world&#8217;s a little bit less day-glo now, and much the worse for it.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">******</p>
<blockquote><p>Sexuality in Rock&#8217;n&#8217;roll is one more area weighed down heavily by its history and language. While none could or should deny the aspects of sexual interest and thrill inherent in live music, the performance space is problematically male-dominated.<br />
– Ian Penman, NME, 1979</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>I really wish that I&#8217;d been born a boy; it&#8217;s easy then ’cause you don&#8217;t have to keep trying to be one all the time.<br />
– Gaye Advert, 1977</p></blockquote>
<p>Women in bands, when under the media spotlight, often find themselves swindled out of due credit by virtue of their gender. If they’re not being accused of clinging to the coattails of their backing boys to disguise their own lack of musical ability, they’re being judged on their aesthetic appeal to the exclusion of anything more relevant. It’s disappointing to observe how ubiquitously this principle applies. Even in the midst of punk, as girls picked up guitars, bass, and drumsticks, taking the stage alongside boys as more than cooing vocalists or backing dancers, they attracted that lethal combination of critical suspicion and prurient interest.</p>
<p>I love punk partly for <a href="http://www.thefword.org.uk/features/2010/04/women_of_the_pu">the number and variety of women</a> it involved and the freedom of expression it offered them. I loved <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Ray_Spex">X-Ray Spex</a></strong> – a Somali-British teenage feminist demagogue whose vocal screech swooped like a bird of prey over twisting vistas of saxophone. I loved <strong><a href="http://johnrobb77.wordpress.com/2010/10/21/ari-up-rip/">The Slits</a></strong> and their slippery, shuddering dub-punk hymns to the tedium of sex and the joys of shoplifting. And most of all, I loved <strong>Gaye Black</strong>, bassist for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adverts"><strong>The Adverts</strong></a> and widely regarded as punk&#8217;s first female star.</p>
<p>Despite their intelligent, era-defining songs like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmX5mgO_KtQ"><strong>Bored Teenagers</strong></a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayHrl-bV1kE"><strong>The Great British Mistake</strong></a>, you have to dig through several layers of punk sediment before the Adverts come to light. They were one of the first punk bands to gain commercial success, and how much of this achievement was down to Gaye is open to depressing debate. A groundbreaking example of the Babe on Bass, her experience prefigured the problems faced by lone women in bands from Blondie to Paramore: scepticism towards their musical ability tied to a disproportionate focus on their looks.</p>
<blockquote><p>She could have the impact of five Runaways, Patti Smith&#8217;s armpit, and Blondie&#8217;s split ends on Britain&#8217;s vacant female scene.<br />
– Jane Suck, Sounds, 1977</p></blockquote>
<p>Gaye’s elevation to national sweetheart began as a generic punk fairytale. In 1976, she and her partner TV Smith made an escape in time-honoured fashion from their Devonshire coastal town to London, where they swiftly formed a band. The Adverts became a fixture at pioneering punk venue <a href="http://www.3ammagazine.com/musicarchives/2003/jan/interview_andy_czezowski.html">the Roxy</a> before being snatched up for a tour with the Damned and a contract with Stiff Records.</p>
<p>A devotee of Iggy Pop and the Stranglers’ bassist Jean-Jacques Burnel, Gaye made her musical presence a vital part of the Adverts’ brand of thuggishly intrepid punk. Their breakthrough single <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKG2rG-s29M"><strong>Gary Gilmore’s Eyes</strong></a> hinges on her instrument’s ascending throb. Most Adverts songs are played as though they’re throwing punches, TV Smith’s vocals advancing in one-two jabs while Gaye’s bass lines bob and weave. On stage, she was a static and self-contained sounding-board for Smith’s livewire showmanship.</p>

<p>But her visual presence hit equally hard: she caught your eye, you caught your breath. Her iconic look – battered black leather and a kohl-rimmed thousand-yard stare – drew on Suzie Quattro and Joan Jett’s effortless rocker fundamentalism rather than the try-hard iconoclasm of Jordan or Siouxsie. Gaye was punk’s terrifyingly blank, stark, dead-eyed minimalism made flesh, the girl nihilist next door.</p>
<p>For Greil Marcus, both Gaye and the Slits were punk’s ‘pretty people who made themselves ugly’ – although clearly not ugly enough. As the reminiscences of her admirers on tribute websites and YouTube comments testify, Gaye was punk’s first female pin-up. Her press and TV appearances stirred hearts and hormones across late-70s Britain, pulling the plug on her wish to be one of the boys.</p>
<blockquote><p>I wasn&#8217;t made to feel as conscious of the fact that I was female [at the Roxy], as I was by the rock press.<br />
– Gaye in Vacant: A Diary Of The Punk Years, Nils &amp; Ray Stevenson</p></blockquote>
<p>In a 2001 interview with the website <a href="http://www.punk77.co.uk/groups/advertsinterviewwithgayeadvert.htm">Punk77</a>, Gaye recalled that &#8220;the media would concentrate on irrelevant things like clothes or be extra critical of my playing in the same way that some men are prejudiced against women drivers&#8221;. The hackneyed trope of whether girls can play seems especially incongruous in punk, a musical movement studded with gleeful and defiant amateurism. Nevertheless, Gaye’s playing was picked on as &#8220;plodding&#8221; and her mute ‘fixed sultriness’ unfavourably compared with the vocal talent of other punk women. This latter criticism betrays, among other things, a peculiar disapproval of girls in non-singing positions, as though there were a correct set of requirements for band composition, with musical preoccupation on the part of female members an intrinsically suspicious transgression of their allotted role.</p>

<p>Dismissal of Gaye’s musical credentials went hand-in-hand with an insistence on her value as eye-candy. According to the <strong>NME</strong>, their bassist’s ‘superb squeakers’ were the best thing about the Adverts and the only conceivable cause of any mainstream notice they might attract. Stiff Records instantly latched onto Gaye’s looks as a marketing tool, giving the Adverts’ <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X57IEdkKy8">debut single</a> a cover bearing a close-up of her face &#8211; all eyes and lips, the band’s name an afterthought. This was a stunt pulled without the band’s prior knowledge, which Gaye avenged by refusing to appear in other band photographs for the single.</p>
<p>As the Adverts gained more media attention, Gaye’s image began to dominate the band’s press. Again, the novelty of her status as sole female in a role other than singer seemed to confer as much fascination as her looks. She complained of fending off photographers’ requests for her &#8220;to pose with my jacket undone&#8221; and sudden &#8220;leching&#8221; from men she’d considered her friends. After &#8216;Gary Gilmore’s Eyes&#8217; hit the Top 20 and the band appeared on <strong>Top of the Pops</strong>, the national response to Gaye was extraordinary. <em>The Sun </em>described her, bafflingly, as ‘one of the saucy girl singers who have taken over pop’, and the <strong>Daily Express</strong><em> </em>swooned that she possessed:</p>
<blockquote><p>…[the same] fragile beauty that made the world and Mick Jagger fall in love with Marianne Faithful. Gaye is beautiful, she is as dark as Marianne was fair, with black hair and Castillian white skin…</p></blockquote>
<p>This presentation of Gaye, and its explicit comparison to pliant and angelic pre-punk darling Faithfull, attempted to explain her as a continuation of the past, rather than a messy break with it. As revolutionary a moment as punk was, it operated within a reactionary framework in which its icons were objectified and misunderstood.</p>
<p>The Adverts disbanded in 1979, their split hastened by Gaye’s discomfort with, and other band members’ resentment of, the puddles of critical drool collecting at her feet. Gaye&#8217;s enduring reputation as prototypical punkette pin-up tends to overshadow what she actually did – which was, in her own words, &#8220;[try] to get a good sound and play right. I&#8217;m not one of Pan&#8217;s People.&#8221; She had the misfortune to attempt this within a context in which women on stage, regardless of their reasons for and intentions in being there, were automatically sexualised, examined and evaluated in a manner wholly absent from attitudes towards their male counterparts. Ever get the feeling you’ve been cheated?</p>
