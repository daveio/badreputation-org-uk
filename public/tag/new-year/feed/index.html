										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey people,</p>
<p>I&#8217;d say &#8220;what a year&#8221;, but we&#8217;re not old enough, so &#8230; what a quarter.</p>
<p>Thank you to the sites that have plugged us, to the twitter users who&#8217;ve RT&#8217;d and Follow Friday&#8217;d us, to the people who met us at Ladyfest and emailed their support, and to our guest bloggers.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re turning out the lights for what we reckon&#8217;s a much-earned Christmas break now, but never fear, we&#8217;ll be back in 2011. </p>

<p><strong><br />
In the three months since our launch in October:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li> we&#8217;ve gone from a team of six permanent writers to nine &#8211; please welcome our newest permanent member Rhian Jones, of <a href="http://velvetcoalmine.wordpress.com/">Velvet Coalmine</a> fame, as seen recently in Marie Claire magazine!</li>
<li>we&#8217;ve overshot the little goal we set ourselves of &#8220;200 twitter followers by Christmas!&#8221; by some way &#8211; woo!</li>
</ul>
<p>This is all thanks to you guys, so like we said: THANK YOU, and don&#8217;t stop now! We&#8217;ve just gotten started.<br />
<strong><br />
What you can look forward to next year:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We&#8217;re working out a way to make the artwork from <a href="/category/alphabet/"><strong>The Alphabet of Feminism</strong> </a>available for sale as a selection of prints, so if you dig Hodge&#8217;s artwork for this feature, watch this space! We&#8217;re also considering releasing the full Alphabet as a little hard copy book &#8211; <a href=mailto:badrepeditosr@gmail.com>let us know</a> if that&#8217;s something you&#8217;d be interested in buying, perhaps as a springtime gift for friends of a bibliophilic bent.</li>
<li><a href="/2010/12/07/found-feminism-ciara-like-a-boy/"><strong>Found Feminism</strong></a> is set to continue &#8211; help us out and send us your snapshots of things you&#8217;ve seen that made you feel just that little bit better about life as a feminist today.</li>
<li> We, er, carry on soapboxing, blurting with violent enthusiasm about things we like, and general tomfoolery ensues, or whatever. Yeah!</li>
</ul>
<p>Merry Christmas! Have a great new year, too.</p>
<p>Rock on,</p>
<p>Team BadRep</p>
