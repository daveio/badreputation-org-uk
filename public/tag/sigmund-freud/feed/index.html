										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li><em>Here&#8217;s Libby of the wonderful <a href="http://treasuryislands.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">TreasuryIslands</a> blog again with Part 2 of her post on <strong>American Horror Story</strong>. If you have a guest post a-brewing, <a href="mailto:badrepeditors@gmail.com?subject=pitch">email us on badrepeditors@gmail.com</a>.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>In <a href="/2012/12/03/guest-post-on-american-horror-story-part-12-lovers-and-mothers/" target="_blank">my previous post yesterday</a>, I talked about the first season of <strong>American Horror Story</strong> and its reliance on two female archetypes &#8211; the femme fatale and the overbearing mother &#8211; in its construction of the monstrous.</p>
<p><strong>The spoiler warning, again, goes here!<br />
</strong><br />
Today, I’m going to talk about reproduction, so if you want to sing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSBCWKuSR9Q" target="_blank">that song from <strong>Grease 2</strong></a>, you better get it out of your system now. Ready?</p>
<p>Mothers are, in the world of <strong>AHS</strong>, a danger not only to their children, but also to the others that touch their lives. Pregnancy, with its easy symbolism and suitably melodramatic and gory end bit, lends itself to Horror. But it is not just the obvious that is made an object of fear.</p>
<h3>Vivien, the walking womb-ded</h3>
<p>As I said in part one, Vivien and Ben are a married couple facing difficulties. She’s had a miscarriage, he’s had an affair, and their relationship is in tatters. I think, I <em>think</em>, that we’re meant to be engaged with this crumbling marriage.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/AHSpic04.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="12799" data-permalink="/2012/12/04/guest-post-on-american-horror-story-part-22-the-terrors-of-reproduction/ahspic04/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/AHSpic04.jpg?fit=617%2C760&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="617,760" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="AHSpic04" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/AHSpic04.jpg?fit=243%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/AHSpic04.jpg?fit=617%2C760&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignleft  wp-image-12799" title="AHSpic04" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/AHSpic04.jpg?resize=346%2C426" alt="Poster for American Horror Story showing the cast standing in an eerie living room" width="346" height="426" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/AHSpic04.jpg?w=617&amp;ssl=1 617w, https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/AHSpic04.jpg?w=243&amp;ssl=1 243w" sizes="(max-width: 346px) 100vw, 346px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>But while Ben is a rounded character &#8211; full of hope and regret, sweetness and cruelty, passion and inertia &#8211; his wife is driven only by her desire to save her marriage, which in turn is driven by her maternal desire.</p>
<p>Like Nora, the basement abortionist&#8217;s wife, Hayden (Ben’s deeply sexual and manipulative mistress), and Constance, the terminally abusive and neglectful mother next door, Vivien simply <em>has uterus, will procreate</em>.<sup><a href="/2012/12/04/guest-post-on-american-horror-story-part-22-the-terrors-of-reproduction/#footnote_0_12760" id="identifier_0_12760" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" In a worrying conflation of hetero femininity and queer masculinity, one half of the gay couple who also haunt the house is also constantly yapping about having a child. ">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Vivien is little more than a vessel, a womb with bouncy hair. She is Shroedinger&#8217;s Uterus, forever pregnant or not pregnant, host to a foetus that is alive or not alive, evil or not evil depending on the requirements of the plot in any given episode. Viven’s role as incubator is underlined when she dies in childbirth &#8211; her role is complete, so we need nothing more from her.</p>
<p>Vivien’s pregnancy is unusual. Hers is a product of <a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superfecundation" target="_blank">heteropaternal superfecundation</a> &#8211; she’s carrying twins with different fathers. One is her husband&#8217;s, the other is the result of her rape by a psychopathic ghost.<sup><a href="/2012/12/04/guest-post-on-american-horror-story-part-22-the-terrors-of-reproduction/#footnote_1_12760" id="identifier_1_12760" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" Who, by the way, IS WEARING A LATEX FETISH SUIT because that isn&rsquo;t sex negative, kink-shaming douchery AT ALL. ">2</a></sup> Let’s not even go into the fact that her husband doesn’t believe she’s been raped &#8211; there’s something much worse than that on the horizon.The show’s mythology tells us that a child born of a ghost and a human will be the antichrist, and we all know what that means: apocalypse.</p>
<p>Just in case the implication of that isn’t clear, let me put it in slightly different terms: Vivien’s vagina is the muggletuppin’ Hellmouth.</p>
<h3>Here’s where we get into the really juicy feminist theory</h3>
<p>Much of what I’ve said so far owes a debt to Barbara Creed’s theory of the monstrous-feminine, and in particular the abject body; the demonisation, defilement and objectification of the female body in Horror.</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/AHSpic02.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="12818" data-permalink="/2012/12/04/guest-post-on-american-horror-story-part-22-the-terrors-of-reproduction/ahspic02/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/AHSpic02.jpg?fit=610%2C384&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="610,384" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="AHSpic02" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/AHSpic02.jpg?fit=300%2C188&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/AHSpic02.jpg?fit=610%2C384&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright  wp-image-12818" title="AHSpic02" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/AHSpic02.jpg?resize=427%2C269" alt="Gory birth scene - screenshot form American Horror Story" width="427" height="269" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/AHSpic02.jpg?w=610&amp;ssl=1 610w, https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/AHSpic02.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 427px) 100vw, 427px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Vivien’s labour and delivery is presented as particularly sanguinary; a festival of blood and sweat. It’s a burlesque of the natural; a grotesque, pantomimic affair attended entirely by a gorily deceased medical staff provided by the house.</p>
<p>With neither the clinical intervention of the modern birthing experience nor the cleanliness of the body innocent, the birth plays on both classically Freudian and modern germophobic fears. It is, from both perspectives, unclean.</p>
<p>The point of Horror, if there must be one, is to walk the line between desirable and undesirable; to cross or threaten the boundaries that separate stability and chaos. Childbirth, as a triumph of the primal over the civilised and the inner over the outer, is a natural exemplar of this. It’s naturally yukky and generally unstoppable, and that makes it pretty frightening. Here we’re treated to close ups of Vivien’s sweat covered forehead, wide overhead shots that emphasise the claustrophobic urgency of the scene, and heavy blood-loss.</p>
<blockquote><p>Horror films that depict monstrous births play on the inside/outside distinction in order to point to the inherently monstrous nature of the womb as well as the impossibility of ever completely banishing the abject from the human domain. [&#8230;] The womb represents the utmost in abjection for it contains a new life form which will pass from inside to outside bringing with it traces of contamination &#8211; blood, afterbirth, faeces.</p>
<p>&#8211; Barbara Creed, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Monstrous-Feminine-Feminism-Psychoanalysis-Popular-Fictions/dp/0415052599/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1353272225&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank"><strong>The Monstrous Feminine: Film, Feminism, Psychoanalysis</strong></a> (1993)</p></blockquote>
<p>Childbirth places us on the side of nature, outside of patriarchal order. Flesh is torn, blood is spilled, the sexual organs begin to resemble a wound. The imagery is graphic, base: abject. Vivien’s affinity with uncivilised, feral nature invoked, her threat to patriarchal law is cemented. The birth of Vivien’s twins is a threat fulfilled, a boundary crossed. From the abject comes the ruin of the world.</p>
<p>Vivien is threatened not just by the hell-spawn she’s carrying, but also by three of the ghosts that share her home. Nora and Hayden, who have lost their own children, and Chad, who has never had children, each desire ownership of Vivien’s child and conspire to steal the baby once it is born.</p>
<p>Baby-snatching is a common, well rooted trope in fantasy and horror, which usually points to the degeneracy of a group or being &#8211; a sign that they’re beyond redemption, truly inhuman. Infants are stolen for ingestion (as in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torchwood:_Children_of_Earth" target="_blank"><strong>Torchwood: Children of Earth</strong></a>), as revenge (like the Pied Piper of Hamlyn) or a sacrificial offering (the <a href="http://www.buffyguide.com/episodes/bandcandy.shtml" target="_blank">Buffy episode <strong>Band Candy</strong></a>) and occasionally, though rarely, to be raised as the kidnapper&#8217;s own. It is this which motivates the childless ghosts of <strong>AHS</strong>.</p>
<p>Each conspirator represents a different level of threat. Deceased interior designer Chad, constantly arguing with his (also dead) partner Patrick, is no threat at all. More concerned as he is with decorating than mending his broken relationship, he seems to think the baby will simply be handed to him. Nora, left to her own devices, is an unlikely threat &#8211; she’s narcissistic enough but ethereal and clueless.</p>
<p>But with Hayden, the picture is quite different. Hayden is wicked, determined and operating without fear of consequence &#8211; she’s dead, after all &#8211; and that’s precisely why she’s so dangerous.</p>
<blockquote><p>The feminine is only established, however, if the wish for a penis is replaced by one for a baby.</p>
<p>&#8211; Freud, “Femininity”, <strong>New Introductory Lectures in Psycho-Analysis</strong> (1933)</p></blockquote>
<p>The problem here is one of motivation. Now, I’m not saying there’s something wrong with wanting children. But there’s something wrong with wanting children to the exclusion of everything else. Hayden is a formidable woman brimming with agency and audacity, and, in a stunning display of the roles women play in our diverse society, she’s pregnant too.</p>
<p>When she dies, she’s contributing all her energy to winning Ben back, and then, bam! One blunt-force trauma later, her whole reason for being has changed. Now, I get that dying is the sort of thing that might emotionally scar a person, but COME ON. The child in her belly, previously presented only as a tool of emotional blackmail, will never appear, so she’s obsessed with replacing it.</p>
<p>And that’s the key to understanding both Hayden and Nora. They both want to replace children they’ve lost. It is a narcissistic craving; a desire merely to possess. The possibility of motherhood has stripped them of rationality, maybe even sanity, and turned them into objects of dread. Here motherhood truly is ‘the most powerful feminine wish’ (Freud again, in 1933), and it is dangerous.</p>
<p>In the eyes of <strong>AHS</strong>, women are to be feared. Female sexuality is aberrant if not abhorrent, and represented by crude Freudian symbolism (if you aren’t yet convinced, check out the suckling infant literally devouring his mother’s breast).</p>
<p>I’m with Simone de Beauvoir when it comes to Freud, but not so Messrs. Murphy and Falchuck; it’s like they’ve tried to dramatise <strong>Introduction to Psychoanalysis</strong>.</p>
<p>The second season of <strong>American Horror Story</strong> recently began its run on UK television (<a href="http://www.fxuk.com/shows/american-horror-story-asylum/about" target="_blank">on FX, new episodes Tuesday evening</a>). So far it&#8217;s really pushing the boat out to hate women in a variety of new and exciting ways under the guise of a critical look at the pathologising of sexuality and historic attitudes to poor mental health.</p>
<p>It’s terrible. You’re going to love it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last time I bought a new pair of high heels, an eleven-year old admired them.</p>
<p>&#8216;I like your shoes!&#8217; she said. &#8216;They have red bits at the back!&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Thanks,&#8217; I said, beating a swift retreat before she noticed that the &#8216;red bits&#8217; were in fact open wounds filled with my encrusted blood, patching the backs of my ankles like some kind of visceral rash.</p>
<p>I should have said &#8216;They&#8217;re Christian Louboutin&#8217;.</p>

<h3>Vertigo</h3>
<p>The shoe designer beloved by female celebrities everywhere (Jennifer Lopez has<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rddslX2BrLE"> a whole song about them</a>) is so proud of his trademark &#8216;red sole&#8217; that he recently took erstwhile collaborator Yves Saint-Laurent to court over red sole copyright infringement. He&#8217;s also currently the subject of a career retrospective at London&#8217;s Design Museum.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s notorious for being one of the first designers to insist, in the early 90s, on a heel that truly towers &#8211; his shoes average at about 4 1/2 inches; the highest peak at dizzying 6 (&#8216;<a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/fash-track/christian-louboutin-opens-up-his-260327">but mostly only dancers can wear them</a>&#8216;) and if you&#8217;re looking for someone to blame when you survey <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/fash-track/christian-louboutin-opens-up-his-260327">the heights on the high-street </a>and sigh, you could be more unjust than to point your finger at this foot-obsessed Frenchman.</p>
<p>As a teenager, Louboutin&#8217;s eye was caught by a &#8216;No Stilettos&#8217; sign at the Museum of Oceanic Art, Paris: &#8216;I wanted to defy that,&#8217; he said. &#8216;I wanted to create something that broke rules and made women feel confident and empowered.&#8217; He&#8217;s stuck to this original image for most of his career: there are very few wedges or block heels in his collections; instead, his heels are thin, vertiginously high and splattered with those red soles.</p>

<p>Where such heights can lead is well illustrated by the fate that meets <strong>Little Women</strong>&#8216;s sixteen-year-old Meg, who wears high heels to a ball &#8211; &#8216;The stupid high heel turned&#8230; It aches so, I can hardly stand, and I don&#8217;t know how I&#8217;m ever going to get home&#8217;.</p>

<p>Yet <a href="http://www.corsetsandcrinolines.com/timelineitem.php?index=187016">this is the sort of height we&#8217;re talking about</a>, for the 1860s. Poor Meg was rather dowdily earth-bound compared to Louboutin&#8217;s fantastical &#8216;ballerina&#8217;, whose eight-inch high &#8216;slippers&#8217; are displayed above left. &#8216;Isn’t the classical dancing ballet slipper the ultimate heel? The heel which makes dancers closer than any other women to the sky, closer to heaven..&#8217; waves Louboutin, airily, in explanation.</p>
<h3>Elevation</h3>
<p>He&#8217;s predictably fascinated with elevation &#8211; the exhibition is full of &#8216;pedestals&#8217; and &#8216;birds&#8217;. But he&#8217;s gone a lot further than previous designers: Meg may have been dowdy in comparison, but even the flappers of the Twenties had <a href="http://0.tqn.com/d/shoes/1/0/p/9/1/shoes_from_1920s.jpg">modest block heels</a>, and the Fifties heel looks <a href="http://static.supadupa.me/shop/3469/images/244619/lacepumps1_grande.jpg?1328749498">almost mumsy</a> nowadays.</p>
<p>One of the pairs exhibited here is accompanied by an <em>apologia </em>from Louboutin, thus: &#8216;This shoe is not suitable for walking in. You can only walk from the taxi to the nightclub, and back, on the arm of a man&#8217;. When asked about the point that women can&#8217;t run in his heels, intended for his &#8216;confident and empowered&#8217; working women (apparently) Louboutin was incredulous: &#8216;<a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2003/02/23/footwear-the-sole-of-sexiness.html">Who runs at work?</a>&#8216;.</p>
<p>Yet he&#8217;s also fascinated by showgirls and &#8216;classic&#8217; vintage-style women (such as his great admirer, Dita Von Teese, who makes a holographic appearance in this exhibition morphing into a Louboutin pump, in a rather literal appropriation of the fetish we&#8217;ll come to presently). Such women, he says, can dance and gyrate for hours at a stretch from atop dizzying heels &#8211; Louboutin learned all about this during an early career stint at the Folies Bergere, where showgirls used to put cuts of bloodless meat inside their heels to make them more comfortable.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is echoed in the sexualised red Louboutin sole (originally hastily-applied Chanel nail varnish) &#8211; a flash of red as easily representing the raw and bloodied foot itself as the raw and (un)bridled sexuality of the wearer.</p>

<p>&#8216;A good shoe is one that doesn&#8217;t dress you but undresses you&#8217;, Christian reckons &#8211; a statement with which Helmut Newton (left) would undoubtedly have agreed. The short David Lynch / Louboutin collaboration film <strong>Fetish</strong> (2007), extracts from which are on display here, shows sequences of otherwise naked women<a href="http://www.coolhunting.com/culture/fetish-by-david.php"> wearing a series of &#8216;unwearable&#8217; Louboutin shoes</a> &#8211; following Louboutin&#8217;s conviction that the part of the female body most naturally fetishised is (you guessed it) the foot.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s even got a mini foot anatomy: one of the pumps on display here has a very low vamp, which was initially unpopular. &#8216;Then I realised, it&#8217;s because of<em> the slit</em>&#8216;, he recalls &#8211; an unfortunate word, given that he means &#8216;toe cleavage&#8217;. Too much &#8216;slit&#8217; apparently makes women feel &#8216;dirty&#8217;, but Louboutin&#8217;s well into it, although the instep is <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/christian-louboutin-the-joy-of-toecleavage-413613.html">his favourite part of the foot</a>, perhaps because of his famous belief that the appeal of the high heel is its <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2011/oct/23/christian-louboutin-high-heels-orgasm?fb=native&amp;CMP=FBCNETTXT9038">approximation of the shape a woman&#8217;s foot assumes during orgasm</a>.</p>
<h3>The fetish</h3>
<p>Of course, Sigmund Freud uses the shoe and foot as an illustration for his writings on the fetish &#8211; the mother&#8217;s shoe, says Sigmund, <a href="http://fashionandpower.blogspot.co.uk/2010/05/fetishism-of-high-heel-shoe.html">represents the penis the child originally assumed she has</a>, and to fixate on it assuages castration anxiety. But symbolic castration via the foot pops up in Louboutin&#8217;s favourite fairy tale (whose centrepiece shoes he&#8217;s <a href="http://www.graziadaily.co.uk/fashion/archive/2012/04/26/christian-louboutin-collaborates-with-disney-to-design-the-new-cinderella-glass-.htm">working on for an upcoming<strong> </strong>film</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8216;[The eldest step-sister] could not get her big toe into it, and the shoe was too small for her. Then her mother gave her a knife and said: &#8220;Cut the toe off; when you are Queen you will have no more need to go on foot.&#8221;</p>
<p>The maiden cut the toe off, forced the foot into the shoe, swallowed the pain, and went out to the King&#8217;s son [&#8230;] He looked down at her foot and saw how the blood was running out of her shoe, and how it had stained her white stocking quite red.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>Cinderella</strong>, The Brothers Grimm</p></blockquote>
<p>The mad but occasionally insightful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_Bettelheim">Bruno Bettleheim</a> sees the stepsisters here attempting to make their big feet more dainty, &#8216;and therefore prove their femininity&#8217; through a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Uses-Enchantment-Importance-Psychology/dp/0140137270">symbolic castration</a> (with a literal twist in stage versions, where they are usually in drag). The problem of the shoe being too dainty is one surprisingly near to Louboutin&#8217;s methods: although the average female foot size is a 5, he designs and constructs his shoes in size 4 &#8216;because I prefer to work on a small thing&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8216;He understands women and makes them feel like Cinderellas&#8217; purrs Diane von Furstenberg on the designer. Indeed, it feels appropriate that <em>stilettos</em>, whose c20th renaissance is credited primarily to the 1950s couturier <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Vivier">Roger Vivier</a> (for Dior) owe their name to the Italian &#8216;dagger&#8217; (hence their unpopularity with parquet flooring).</p>
<h3>Domination</h3>
<p>For me, the images in <strong>Fetish </strong>of these women crawling and sidling about in painfully unwearable shoes sums up this retrospective rather well: a fascination with immobility, and a craving for Fabulous Female Domination that suggests more power than it would actually have were it being negotiated from atop a pair of Louboutin <em>pigalles</em>.</p>
<p>But you <em>look</em> like you could walk down the treacherously lumpy terrain of my naked back, make me lick your Louboutin boots&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8216;I declare, it really seems like being a fine young lady, to come home from the party in a carriage, and sit in my dressing-gown with a maid to wait on me,&#8217; said Meg, as Jo bound up her foot with arnica.</p>
<p>&#8211; Louisa May Alcott, <strong>Little Women</strong></p></blockquote>
