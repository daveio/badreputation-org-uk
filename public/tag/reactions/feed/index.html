										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three short months after the release of Ezio’s last dance, <strong>Assassin’s Creed: Revelations</strong>, and we&#8217;ve been graced by the presence of the first <strong>Assassin’s Creed III</strong> reveal.  So Stephen B, Markgraf, Miranda and I had a chatette.</p>
<p>First off: <a title="Assassin's Creed 3 reveal" href="http://youtu.be/amAVgQ8ef3g" target="_blank">go check out the trailer if you haven’t seen it already.</a></p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/amAVgQ8ef3g" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Stephen B:</strong> Well, I&#8217;m a Brit, and that probably colours my reaction to the setting. I&#8217;m just not invested in how glorious the War of Independence was, and killing the dastardly English isn&#8217;t really as exciting to me as Assassins vs. Templars.</p>
<p>My first reaction was concern for the fighting: is going up against guns with a small hand-axe really going to work?  The moves lacked the skill and finesse of previous styles, although they&#8217;re better on a repeat viewing.  Plus, I am a bit disappointed that no-one else is <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/01/09/found-feminism-mass-effect-3-pre-order-box/">following <strong>Mass Effect 3</strong>&#8216;s lead</a> and doing female version trailers. Or&#8230; having <em>even one female</em> in the whole trailer.</p>
<p>All this grand posturing is about English vs. American white guys only and the protagonist is of Native American descent, so while you&#8217;re blowing all those trumpets you&#8217;re ignoring the incredible ongoing &amp; future genocide. The game <em>might</em> highlight how his people are treated as part of the story, but that&#8217;s not clear from the trailer.</p>

<p><strong>Miranda:</strong> Would it be possible to have a leading lady in this franchise? I&#8217;d love that &#8211; I like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando:_A_Biography"><strong>Orlando</strong></a>-esque idea of the protagonist being different genders through time &#8211; but isn&#8217;t <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desmond_Miles">Desmond</a> always the person, er, &#8220;wearing&#8221; the history? So I imagine we&#8217;d have to lose him as well; they&#8217;d have to create a female equivalent? Even without that leap, I&#8217;m personally hoping there are less Sex Assassin type ladies this time around, and more, y&#8217;know, female <em>characters</em>.</p>
<p>Readers might remember the <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/01/19/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-the-frank-miller-effect-strikes-again/">last time we covered Assassin&#8217;s Creed on here and talked about the Sex Assassin NPC thing</a> &#8211; Ubisoft Workshop staff actually read the post, which featured Markgraf&#8217;s own designs for female assassins, and gave it a friendly shoutout, which was nice to see (sadly, when I try to find <a href="http://www.ubiworkshop.com/2011/05/25/home-made-assassin/">the shoutout</a>, it&#8217;s been archived and doesn&#8217;t seem to have the hyperlinks anymore. Shame, that &#8211; we were originally hyperlinked from &#8220;we thought this would quell some people&#8217;s fears on where we stand on important subjects&#8221;). We then had a bit of feedback from people who pointed out that there are female assassins in <strong>ACII</strong> you can deploy places, so then we made <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/02/08/assassins-creed-postscript-and-haystack-challenge/">another post to address that a bit</a>, because the point is, we&#8217;re aware of that, but it&#8217;s not like there isn&#8217;t room for a good deal of progress. </p>
<p><strong>Rai:</strong> I too am concerned about how they’ll fit this protagonist into the grand scheme of things: after all historically it&#8217;s one set of oppressive zealots complaining about being oppressed (by the English) without a shadow of irony as they murder and destroy the indigenous population.  Given the protagonist&#8217;s ethnicity, one has to wonder how he&#8217;s on either side of this war, given the racist sentiments aimed at Native Americans (in that era and beyond).</p>
<p>On the anti-Brit theme, I have my doubts that it&#8217;ll be handled appropriately or even accurately &#8211; there are tendencies when anything American is involved for Brits to be portrayed as some sort of devil spawn (which is getting pretty dull).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty peeved it is <strong><em>still </em></strong>a dude.  What happened to all the stuff at the end of <strong>Brotherhood</strong> when Minerva was telling Desmond to go and find this &#8216;other assassin&#8217; he&#8217;d need to beat the Templars?  Minerva was using female pronouns to talk about this other assassin &#8211; so, where is she?</p>
<p>Changing tack slightly: the trees(!) &#8211; in the trailer we see the guy free-running among the branches. This could be an interesting switch from the buildings we&#8217;re used to thus far.</p>
<p>Also did anyone else hear the theory that <strong>AC3</strong> would be set in the Far East?  If so&#8230; would Far East have been a better setting than 1777 America?  I think so, but then America is of very little interest to me as it all feels quite egomaniacal: could the setting of <strong>AC3</strong> be a ploy to get more US fans?  Or to bring the centre of attention back on to the USA, as is the tendency of <em>so many</em> games?</p>
<p><strong>Stephen B:</strong> Well, I suppose the previous games were quite brave in that the first one had you playing a medieval Arab, and the second went to Italy with no mention of the US. So it could be okay that they do <em>one</em> in the USA&#8230; but the Far East would have been a lot more exciting for me.</p>
<p><strong>Markgraf:</strong> As per Rai&#8217;s reaction, I&#8217;m baffled as to why our hero isn&#8217;t a woman, still &#8211; I mean, come on, it&#8217;s 2012, surely we know that women exist by now and that it&#8217;s fine to have them as protagonists?</p>
<p>But my angle is this one: I&#8217;m keen to see people of colour represented as actual hero-y heroes in games, because it&#8217;s damn rare, it&#8217;s <em>still</em> damn rare, and that&#8217;s frankly an embarrassment to civilisation as a whole.  So I&#8217;m delighted, actually, to see that Ratohnhaké:ton is mixed race and doing his bit for First Nations people in games.</p>
<p>The <strong>Assassin&#8217;s Creed</strong> franchise is doing itself quite proud of multiculturalism in games: it started the series with you playing Altaiir ibn La-Ahad, who is a Syrian Arab, born and raised, which is literally one of the only examples I can think of where the playable protagonist is Arab.  But you&#8217;ll all remember that Altaiir had an American voice, and if you peered under his hood, it was Desmond doing an Altaiir cosplay.  So, you had a character with the right sort of name for the place he was in, but without the right sort of voice, and not really the right sort of face, either, which was pretty much ethnicity-trimming, if you ask me.</p>
<p>No-one can possibly have any problems with the representation of First Nations people &#8211; they&#8217;re under-represented and it&#8217;s uncontroversial to represent them as heroes &#8211; and that&#8217;s <em>great</em>, but I do feel bad for Altaiir, the Arab hero that never really was.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not that thrilled by the setting, either, to be honest.  For all the reasons we&#8217;ve mentioned (yet another America-centric game) but also because&#8230; I just want to see a more diverse range of ethnic backgrounds to playable characters, really.  So couldn&#8217;t we have wandered further afield than America for the third?</p>
<p>(And raise your hand if you&#8217;re bored of having The English!!! as villains in things&#8230;)</p>
<p>Oh, and I&#8217;m also excited that YOU CAN CLIMB TREES!!!!, yes.</p>
<p><strong>Rai:</strong> I too am more than pleased that the <strong>AC</strong> franchise has done good things for protagonists of diverse ethnicity and to have another character in that trend is good; even better if he is actually his own self and not just Desmond-in-a-hood!  Their failings with portraying Altaiir appropriately will always stick in my mind though.</p>
<p>It is a shame it&#8217;s not a woman though, and it is a shame it&#8217;s in America &#8211; if previous form is anything to go by, we may end up with a trilogy of games in that period, and I suspect they&#8217;ve brought it home to America so they can more easily blend into Desmond fighting Templars himself in the present/future.  So I have no idea where on earth this &#8216;she&#8217; assassin Minerva was banging on about is going to come from.  I truly hope they don&#8217;t just let Desmond find her and then she&#8217;s an unplayable sidekick character.</p>
<h3>Conclusions:</h3>
<p><strong>Miranda:</strong> “Hurrah for more beautiful vertigo-inducing rendering, but let&#8217;s hope there are some women NPCs at least in this that are written as characters, not damsels and sex machines!”</p>
<p><strong>Stephen B:</strong> “Potential racial sensitivity GOOD, provided they stick to it. Setting&#8217;s a bit blah; hoping the general &#8216;Assassins vs Templars&#8217; struggle is enough of a hook to keep me interested.”</p>
<p><strong>Markgraf:</strong> “I BET THE FANDOM ARE MORE HAPPY TO ACCURATELY REPRESENT THIS GUY&#8217;S ETHNICITY THAN ALTAIIR&#8217;S BECAUSE HE WON&#8217;T BE ALL WHITEWASHED IN-GAME LOL”</p>
<p><strong>Rai:</strong> “Where is my she-assassin?!  Good to see an appropriately portrayed non-white protagonist, but the American setting feels like a bit of a disappointment, and definitely poked my inner cynic with a very pointy stick.”</p>
