										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello, BadRep.</p>
<p>Today is <a href="http://www.worlddownsyndromeday.org/">World Down Syndrome Day 2011</a>.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how much you know about <a href="http://www.downs-syndrome.org.uk/">Down Syndrome</a> as an individual reader.  Don&#8217;t know much about it? Go and find out more about it. Think you know about it? Take some time to read and listen a bit more. Don&#8217;t be the person who scrolls on, eh? </p>
<p>I learned about Down Syndrome Day because I have a younger sister with Down Syndrome whom I lived with for sixteen years (I only moved out about two years ago) and so my family have lifetime membership of the Down Syndrome Association.  I&#8217;d like everyone to know about it, though.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to tell you a great deal about my family here because this is a short post &#8211; and because I haven&#8217;t asked what my sister thinks either about blogging on here, or being blogged about, yet, and not to do so would be at the least a bit cheeky. And also missing the point massively, in that &#8220;raising awareness&#8221; doesn&#8217;t mean I (an able-bodied person) get to trot out my non-consenting family on the internet in the name of Issues, or decide that <em>me</em> posting is better than actually getting they themselves on here to speak.  </p>
<p>But here are some things to look at and read:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://disabledfeminists.com/2010/11/17/disability-is-a-feminist-issue-gendering-health-access/">Why disability is a feminist issue</a></strong>, from Feminists With Disabilities for a Way Forward.  It&#8217;s a US-based perspective, but really, you should read it. Edit: <a href="http://disabledfeminists.com/2009/10/14/disability-is-a-feminist-issue/">this post too</a>.
</li>
<li>
A <a href="http://blog.thearc.org/2010/11/19/i-am-not-a-disability-eliza-schaaf/">recent case of <strong>completely shitty education-based discrimination</strong></a> against a young woman with Down Syndrome. The words of her parents on this one struck a depressingly familiar chord with mine. They&#8217;ve had to navigate this sort of bullshit far too often, too.</li>
<li>Mencap: <a href="http://www.mencap.org.uk/landing.asp?id=1683">find out more about what a learning disability is</a>. Over 1.5 million people in the UK have a learning disability, so if you really care about activism and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersectionality">intersectionality</a> of any kind, it&#8217;s worth your time. Seriously.</li>
</ul>

<p>Read, think, share links around, and have a good week.</p>
