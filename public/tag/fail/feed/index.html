					<description><![CDATA[When the call came around for horror-themed posts for autumn and winter, I decided to take on the Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter series.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Early December. The leaves have fallen, the sky has darkened. Rain lashes the windows. Doors yawn open before you; blackness whispers chill secrets into your hair, and your worst nightmares take shape &#8216;twixt the smoky trees, taunting, menacing. Waiting.</p>
<p>Basically, at the time of writing it was the month with Hallowe&#8217;en in it, and I hate to waste a perfectly good theme. So without further ado, allow me to welcome you to <strong>Hopeless Reimantic Presents</strong>! In this column I&#8217;ll be going in-depth into the works of specific authors who are in &#8211; or cross over into &#8211; the romance genre. In the spirit of the season, I thought we&#8217;d take a look at the stuff of nightmares: let&#8217;s talk about Laurell K. Hamilton. More specifically, let&#8217;s talk about <strong>Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter</strong>, one of the weirdest and most controversial series I&#8217;ve ever interacted with.</p>

(Via Marvel Wiki.)</p></div>
<p>First of all, a slightly complicated preface. Before I ever picked up an Anita Blake book I knew quite a lot about them, and while I&#8217;d like to stress that I&#8217;m here to talk about the <em></em>books and <em>not</em> Ms Hamilton herself I feel like I&#8217;ll be remiss if I don&#8217;t at least give a quick summary of some common controversies surrounding the series and its author.</p>
<p>I first became aware of Laurell K. Hamilton via Anne Rice. Well, not Anne Rice herself, but <a href="http://www.journalfen.net/community/fandom_wank/515245.html?nc=911" target="_blank">the now-infamous Anne Rice Author Tantrum</a>, which I arrived at a couple of years after the fact and consequently saw linked to&#8230;Laurell K. Hamilton&#8217;s <a href="http://eragon-sporkings.wikispaces.com/Hamiltons_Response_To_Negative_Readers" target="_blank">similarly poor handling of criticism</a> (link to a Wikispace article, as the original blog post has vanished).</p>
<p>Hamilton isn&#8217;t quite as vitriolic in her I Can&#8217;t Believe Not Everyone Likes My Book-ness, but she&#8217;s still pretty irritatingly condescending, although I do agree with her that if someone&#8217;s taking their book up to you so that you can sign it, then opening with &#8220;I hated this one and what you&#8217;ve done with the series&#8221; is kind of poor form.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s since made a name for herself on Twitter for calling her critics <a href="https://twitter.com/LKHamilton/status/200273311530360832" target="_blank">sexually frustrated</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/LKHamilton/status/200272147720056832" target="_blank">jealous</a> <a href="http://lkh-lashouts.livejournal.com/562684.html#cutid1" target="_blank">wannabes</a>, and a name for herself among readers and other writers for<a href="http://mybookgoggles.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/authors-behaving-badly-laurell-k.html" target="_blank"> not handling criticism well </a>and <a href="http://www.likesbooks.com/cgi-bin/bookReview.pl?BookReviewId=9647" target="_blank">shamelessly inserting herself into her books</a>. The <a href="http://lkh-lashouts.livejournal.com/" target="_blank">LKH_lashouts</a> community on LiveJournal keeps a nice catalogue of her various posts, blogs and misdemeanours, and I&#8217;ve been on it all day, which might explain why my brain is starting to feel too heavy for my skull.</p>
<p>As a lot of you probably aren&#8217;t familiar with what makes the Anita Blake series so divisive in the first place, I&#8217;ll give you a quick, neutral description to start us off (don&#8217;t worry, we&#8217;ll get to the incoherent ranting later). The <strong>Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter</strong> series started out as a kind of monster-of-the-week dealio, with some romance in it but not a huge deal. The romantic &#8211; and sexual &#8211; content of the books got a lot more page time as the series went on, and the tenth book in the series, <strong>Narcissus In Chains</strong>, saw a metaphysical event turn Anita Blake into a succubus who needs sex to survive.</p>
<p>Subsequent books are arguably more &#8220;paranormal erotica&#8221; than anything else, and the last time I checked in with Ms Blake she was in a polyamorous relationship with five guys and happy as a clam. This, and the fact that a lot of the events of Anita Blake&#8217;s love life seem to mirror the author&#8217;s, have led to accusations that Laurell K. Hamilton is using Anita to brag about how much sex she&#8217;s having, and have turned a lot of readers off the series.</p>
<p>The upshot of all this is that this time three months ago, your intrepid romance novel enthusiast knew <em>of</em> Laurell K. Hamilton and had formed a pretty strong impression of the <strong>Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter</strong> books &#8211; but had never actually picked one up. So when the call came around for horror-themed posts for autumn and winter, and I decided to take them on, I was&#8230;nervous, but excited. Here was a series with a strong female lead which had lost popularity as the erotic content had upped and the quality of the writing had deteriorated &#8211; the stuff of feminist bad-porn-lovers&#8217; wildest dreams, right?</p>
<p>All that given due consideration, I wanted to approach the series with an open mind, but I didn&#8217;t want to actually buy any of the books because a) this isn&#8217;t somebody I want to give money to and b) there are approximately bleventeen of the damned things and I don&#8217;t have a job. I put out a call on my social medias for donations to the cause.</p>
<p>Three weeks later, I had <em>seventeen Laurell K. Hamilton books</em>. And with various deadlines coming up? I had a week to read them in.</p>
<p>Some would have panicked. Some would have faltered. Some would have done several noisy circuits of the living room, sobbing about the hilarious injustice of life. Some would have said, &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s okay, I don&#8217;t have to read all of these, I&#8217;m not <em>that</em> much of a masochist&#8221;, picked out a selection, and called it a day.</p>
<p>I did all of these things except the last one. Here&#8217;s how I got on. The following are my initial notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Initial thoughts on LKH: The Anita Blake series is not as bad as I thought it would be for the reasons I was told I would hate it, but it is creepingly terrible in ways I didn&#8217;t really anticipate.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Day 3 of LKH immersion. Eyes gritty. Legs heavy. Some subcranial tenderness. Seem to have &#8220;What Does The Fox Say&#8221; stuck in my head.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Laurell K. Hamilton Immersion Week, Day 5. Sore throat, some muscle ache. Have been reading some of the earlier books, which are much better even if I don&#8217;t like murder mysteries that much. I&#8217;m sad that her deep love of stuffed penguins seems to be worn away by all the sexy sexy sex she starts having in a book or so&#8217;s time. What happened to Sigmund, Anita? Did Sigmund mean nothing to you? Developing protective feelings for all penguins.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>LKH Immersion Week, Day 6. I&#8230;I just don&#8217;t even know anymore, you guys. Just leave me alone. I&#8217;m going shopping for leather.</p></blockquote>
<p>By the end of the week I&#8217;d contracted a stomach virus, although the medical jury is still out on whether or not this was a symptom of my burgeoning lycanthropy. The next full moon isn&#8217;t until December 17th, so I guess we&#8217;ll find out then.</p>
<p>This is going to be a difficult bit of analysis to write, because &#8211; well, I read seventeen books, you guys. I&#8217;m having to be extremely choosy about which books I quote and why. Maybe I&#8217;ll upload a list of Supplementary Supportive Material, but, um, I wouldn&#8217;t count on it.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, dear readers, here&#8217;s the thing: <em>I didn&#8217;t hate these books the way I was expecting to</em>.</p>
<p>Look, fourteen-year-old me assumed I&#8217;d hate these books because they were a self-insert Mary-Sue-type series that ended with the main character having far too much ridiculously improbable sex and being the best at everything. Fourteen-year-old me was also scared of non-monogamy, kind of selective in her feminism and a lot more judgmental. Fourteen-year-old me would probably have written this bit of the article in a far more entertainingly vitriolic manner.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you&#8217;re stuck with twenty-three-year-old me, and twenty-three-year-old me doesn&#8217;t have a problem with any of these things on principle. Look, okay, self-insert Mary-Sues aren&#8217;t my cup of tea, and I can see why a sharp rise (hurr) in sexual content in a series which basically had no sexual content at all for the first four books might turn readers off &#8211; but those two facts don&#8217;t make either of those authorial decisions inherently wrong.</p>
<p>For all her flaws (and she has many &#8211; and I&#8217;m not just talking about the fun kind of flaws that make a character seem real, either) Anita Blake has some nice bits of refreshingly feminist outlook. One of the best story arcs in the series comes in <strong>Danse Macabre,</strong> when she has a pregnancy scare. She talks it over with all of her partners, one of them says he&#8217;ll stay at home and raise the baby so that she can keep working, and another says he&#8217;ll marry her:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Jesus, Mary and Joseph, Richard, is that all you think it takes to fix this? Marry me so the baby won&#8217;t be a bastard, and it&#8217;s all better?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see anyone else offering marriage,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s because they know I&#8217;ll say no. Every other man in my life understands that this isn&#8217;t about marriage. It&#8217;s about the fact that we may have created a little person. And we need to do whatever is best for that little person. How will marrying anyone make this work better? &#8230; What do you think having a baby will do to me, Richard? Do you think just because I have a baby I&#8217;ll become this other person? This softer, gentler person? Is that what you think?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8211; Laurell K. Hamilton, <strong>Danse Macabre</strong>, pp. 162-164</p></blockquote>
<p>Whatever else I think about Anita Blake the character, I wholeheartedly rooted for her throughout this story arc. Would it have been unrealistic for her to keep being a federal agent who has all the sex and also a baby? Sure, maybe. But this is a fantasy series and clearly delineated as such, so if that&#8217;s too much suspension of disbelief for you then <a href="http://fuckyeahscifiwomenofcolour.tumblr.com/post/37413846476/author-scott-lynch-responds-to-a-critic-of-the" target="_blank">allow me to refer you to Scott Lynch</a>.</p>
<p>Regarding the non-monogamy&#8230;well, there are not a lot of mainstream series that won&#8217;t even touch non-monogamy with a bargepole, and twenty-three-year-old me quite likes the normalisation of non-mono and monogamous relationships here. What I&#8217;m basically trying to say here is that if Laurell K. Hamilton wants to chronicle her sexy adventures as Badass The Vampire Slayer (And Harem) and people want to read it, I&#8217;m honestly okay with that. I wish she&#8217;d be more honest about what her books are (she seems to do a lot of If You Don&#8217;t Like It You&#8217;re Just Too Mainstream For My Awesomeness-ing), but &#8211; whatever. Fine.</p>
<p>However. The fact that I didn&#8217;t hate these books for the reasons I&#8217;d assumed doesn&#8217;t mean that they in no way made me want to tear my own eyes out. Unfortunately this article is skittering dangerously close to its word limit, so stand by for <strong>Part Two</strong>, in which I attempt to explain why cleanly and concisely but inevitably deteriorate into wordless, feeble sobbing.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t wait! See you then.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello my darlings!  This month I&#8217;m back to my mid-month gaming post (as last month I wandered into the<a title="Silent Witness s15: ‘Calm down, dear…’" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/05/28/silent-witness-s15-calm-down-dear/" target="_blank"> realms of TV</a>) and I&#8217;ll be presenting to you the Humble Bundle V, after which we&#8217;ll be taking a bit of a negative turn&#8230; you will see.  Potential <em>trigger warning</em>, mind you, of the Epic Rage descent.</p>
<h3>Humble Bundle V</h3>
<p>The <strong><a title="The Humble Bundle" href="http://www.humblebundle.com" target="_blank">Humble Bundle</a></strong> is a nice little concept: a collection of indie titles for you to pay what you want for and then decide how much of that fee goes to a) the developers, b) Humble Bundle themselves, or c) charity.</p>
<p>I got it on the first day (and, sorry, but by the time this post goes live I suspect the window will have closed) so I only got the first five games that were included.  Since then there&#8217;ve been three more titles added if you paid over the average.  These were added in light of this bundle making over <a title="PC Gamer: Humble Indie Bundle makes $1.8m in first 15 hours" href="http://www.pcgamer.com/2012/06/01/humble-indie-bundle-5-makes-1-8-million-in-15-hours/?ns_campaign=article-feed&amp;ns_mchannel=ref&amp;ns_source=steam&amp;ns_linkname=0&amp;ns_fee=0" target="_blank">$1.8 million in the first 15 hours</a>.</p>
<p>Included in the Bundle were:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Psychonauts</strong></li>
<li><strong>Amnesia: The Dark Descent</strong></li>
<li><strong>LIMBO</strong></li>
<li><strong>Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sorcery EP</strong></li>
<li><strong>Bastion</strong>*</li>
<li><strong>Braid</strong>*+</li>
<li><strong>Lone Survivor</strong>*+</li>
<li><strong>Super Meat Boy</strong>*+</li>
</ul>
<p><em>* denotes games that were unlocked if you paid over the average; + denotes those titles added at a later stage.</em></p>
<p>Like I say, I only got the first five, but I&#8217;m not too sore as I already have <strong>Braid</strong> (not a big fan) and I&#8217;m not overly interested in the other two.  I&#8217;m not going to discuss the games themselves here because that&#8217;ll be coming in a &#8220;Playing&#8230;&#8221; post later on.</p>
<p>I thought it would be nice show you that sometimes, somewhere out there, someone does something good.  A lot of money has been raised for charity through this: not least through Big Names of Gaming competing to be the top contributors (<em>Notch</em> and <em>HumbleBrony Bundle</em> have been vying for the top spot: when I bought the bundle they were dueling around the $3000 mark, now they&#8217;re on $12,345.67 and £11,111.11 respectively).</p>

<p>Of course, as the popularity of indie games continues to rise, it&#8217;s nice to be able to have the choice to decide how much of your cash goes to the developers as opposed to not really knowing for sure how much just gets kept by various third parties.</p>
<h3>Sigh, Misogyny</h3>
<p>From that nice little snippet of camaraderie, I regret that I must now depress the tone somewhat and talk about InternetFail, and more specifically, how it&#8217;s been discussed recently with regard to the world of gaming.</p>
<p>At the start of June <strong>BBC News Magazine</strong> ran an article highlighting the constant, abhorrent abuse that female gamers get in online play: <a title="BBC News Magazine: Sexual harrasment in the world of video games" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-18280000" target="_blank">here</a>.  It mostly focusses on the experiences of one Wisconsin gamer called Jenny, of the<strong> CoD</strong> ilk, and the abuse she gets daily on voice chats.  She records them and uploads them to her website, <strong><a title="Not in the Kitchen Anymore" href="http://www.notinthekitchenanymore.com/" target="_blank">Not in the Kitchen Anymore</a></strong>, and I gotta say, she handles this shit pretty well but the point is she<em> shouldn&#8217;t have to</em>.  Especially, as the article points out, 42% of US gamers are women, and adult women outnumber teenage boys quite considerably.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a <a title="BBC World Service: Assignment: Guns, Girls and Games" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00s9jly" target="_blank">BBC World Service programme</a> based on her experiences and those of other female gamers.  If you read the article or listen to the programme you might hear some charming young fellows claiming<em> &#8220;freedom of speech&#8221;</em>, but here&#8217;s a point of interest for any such time someone tries to use this smokescreen of an excuse if you call them out as misogynists (or racists, homophobes, etc&#8230; the list, depressingly, goes on).  In both American and European (incl. British) law the &#8220;freedom of speech&#8221; excuse doesn&#8217;t fly.</p>
<p>Why&#8217;s that?  Well, if you actually read the laws you&#8217;ll see there are exclusions to what the precious First Amendment protects: <a title="Wikipedia: Freedom of Speech in the USA - Categorical Exclusions" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech_in_the_United_States#Categorical_exclusions" target="_blank">look here</a>.  What&#8217;s that?  Obscenity?  Threats?  Defamation?  Intentional infliction of emotional distress?  They&#8217;re <em>all</em> excluded from protection by the First Amendment?  OHGAWDNO!  It&#8217;s like living in a world where people treat each other with respect!  How horrible.</p>
<p>And, Euro law?  <em>Just for starters</em> you can consult <a title="Wikipedia: Article 10 of the ECHR" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_10_of_the_European_Convention_on_Human_Rights" target="_blank">Article 10</a> and <a title="Wikipedia: Article 14 of the ECHR" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights#Article_14_-_discrimination" target="_blank">Article 14</a> of the European Convention of Human Rights.  Yeah.  <strong><em>Human rights</em></strong>.  But be careful out there: trying to educate these fools in the error of their ways <strong>and</strong> the legal flaws in their defence might offend them.  The fact you&#8217;ve done some learnings <em>(that aren&#8217;t centred around how to make tasty lunchtime treats)</em> is clearly a work of pure evil!</p>
<p>Although Jenny of Wisconsin might be able to deal with it, there are a lot of people out there who can&#8217;t or don&#8217;t want to.  It takes a lot of effort, seriously.  I&#8217;m an antisocial gamer &#8211; we know this &#8211; I like playing games on my own, I hate chat and I hate voice-chats even more.  I don&#8217;t want to listen to somebody&#8217;s inane drivel while I shoot stuff, regardless of the content.  I ditched the <a title="[Gamer Diary] The Case of the MMOs – Boisterous Behaviour Abounds!" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/08/16/gamer-diary-the-case-of-the-mmos-boisterous-behaviour-abounds/" target="_blank">one MMO I played</a> a long time ago because of the racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic crap that occurred on a daily basis.  Not directed at me, just <em>there</em> &#8211; and no one really ever objected (if you did, you got the abuse turned on you).</p>
<p>My solution is not one that everyone can adopt.  I just avoid the social elements, even if it&#8217;s online team-based play like <strong>TF2</strong>, and I refuse to disclose any information about myself.  Generally, I am the wallpaper: I keep quiet and ignore chat.  This is mostly because I&#8217;m a misanthrope and do not care for being social, but partly it&#8217;s also because I know that a lot of people on chat are going to be dicks.  I just don&#8217;t understand why banter has to be offensive, even if it doesn&#8217;t go near questions of gender.</p>

<p>But back to the specific point of misogyny in the gamingverse.  I mentioned the KickStarter from <strong>Feminist Frequency</strong> in May&#8217;s &#8220;<a title="[Gamer Diary] – What I’ve Been Playing… May 2012" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/06/08/gamer-diary-what-ive-been-playing-may-2012/" target="_blank">Playing&#8230;</a>&#8221; post and the woman behind it, Anita Sarkeesian, has been yet another figurehead victim of abuse.  She put her head over that parapet, so to speak, and has had it all but <a title="New Statesman: Dear Internet, this is why you can't have nice things" href="http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/internet/2012/06/dear-internet-why-you-cant-have-anything-nice" target="_blank">shot to smithereens</a>.  Gladly, however, this isn&#8217;t going to stop her making those videos, nor <a title="KickStarter: Tropes vs women in video games" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/566429325/tropes-vs-women-in-video-games" target="_blank">has it stopped people pledging</a> (when I last checked, she was on $87,000+ with 68 hours left to go).  But this sort of thing does make me want to adopt a superhero persona, fly all over the world, and stand in defence of these women.</p>
<p>I was going to say &#8220;brave women&#8221; just ther, but that, to me, gives too much credit to these scum-sucking parasites of the internet.  It shouldn&#8217;t have to be brave just to identify as female and like games.  <strong>FFS</strong>.</p>
<p>At least &#8211; if we&#8217;re to take anything positive away from this &#8211; this all-too-common abuse is being given more and more of a public face.  A site that BBC article mentions is <strong><a title="Fat, Ugly or Slutty" href="http://fatuglyorslutty.com/" target="_blank">Fat,  Ugly or Slutty</a></strong><em> (because that&#8217;s pretty much all you are if you&#8217;re a female gamer, apparently)</em> where you can upload screengrabs of sexist abuse/harrasment.  So, if you can catch the abuse you receive, or see, in a screen grab or a recording, make it known!</p>
