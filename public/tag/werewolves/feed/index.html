<p><strong>CONTENT NOTE:</strong> Discussions herein of sexual assault, dubious consent, mental health treated badly, homophobia, biphobia and slut-shaming. Oh, and plenty of spoilers.</p>
<p>Welcome back to <strong>Hopeless Reimantic Presents</strong>! <a href="/2013/12/04/hopeless-reimantic-presents-anita-blake-vampire-hunter-part-one" target="_blank">Last time we got our teeth into <strong>Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter</strong></a>, and I found myself actually saying some pretty positive things about the books. (Honestly, I&#8217;m as surprised as you. My fourteen-year-old self is throwing one hell of a sulk.) It&#8217;s not the full story, though, and there&#8217;s still quite a lot about this series to unpack.</p>
<p>First of all, there&#8217;s something I need to make clear: as I said in <a href="/2013/12/04/hopeless-reimantic-presents-anita-blake-vampire-hunter-part-one" target="_blank">Part One</a>, I went into this review determined not to talk about the series in relation to Laurell K. Hamilton herself more than was necessary.</p>
<p>I generally hold that unless an author has done something that I can&#8217;t reconcile myself to morally, I don&#8217;t feel like it&#8217;s my business to talk about their personal life when I am supposed to be reviewing their books. And from what I&#8217;ve read of Laurell K. Hamilton&#8217;s blog posts, she seems kind of entitled and I find her annoying, but&#8230;well, let&#8217;s just say that as far as I can tell she&#8217;s no Orson Scott Card. By and large my problems with the ideas she puts across can easily be expressed in criticism of her work rather than criticism of her.</p>
<p>I ran into some problems with this approach, to be sure; the evidence for Anita Blake being the author&#8217;s avatar is pretty compelling. But for the purposes of analysing the text, I&#8217;m putting that debate to bed. From here on out, guys, they&#8217;re just books, so if anyone is reading this expecting it to be a catalogue of Ms Hamilton&#8217;s character flaws, well, it&#8217;s not going to be. Hashtag sorry not sorry, or something.</p>
<p>Oh, one more thing: I&#8217;m limiting myself to a maximum of one book quotation per point here, because SEVENTEEN BOOKS LORD HAVE MERCY.</p>
<p>Okay! Let&#8217;s get started. Where were we? Was I wanting to tear my eyes out? I think I was wanting to tear my eyes out.</p>
<p>&#8230;I&#8217;m going to need to slip into a more concise format, I think, or that&#8217;s just going to be the entire article. Here, then, in no particular order, are My Main Problems with Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter:</p>
<h3>1) Anita only has one dating experience that I would describe as fully consensual.</h3>
<p>She dates Richard, a werewolf, and then she gets engaged to Richard, and <em>then</em> the vampire she&#8217;s been hanging out with decides that he needs &#8220;equal time&#8221; to win her over, or he&#8217;s got no choice but to duel Richard to the death:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;You have dated him for months, and I have said little. Before you marry him, I want equal time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been trying to avoid you for months. I&#8217;m not just going to give in now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I will start the music, and we will dance. Even if I die, and you die. Richard will die first, I can promise you that. Surely dating me is not a fate worse than death.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8211; Laurell K. Hamilton, <strong>The Lunatic Cafe</strong>, p.221.</p></blockquote>
<p>(I&#8217;m not so sure about that, dude.)</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also the shapeshifter leopard who basically just rapes her (it&#8217;s okay, she enjoys it) and then is her mate and it&#8217;s all fine, and the other shapeshifter leopard who is Terrifyingly Submissive at her until she gives in (more on that later). These are her four main men and, last I checked, the various loves of her life.</p>
<p>There are a couple of things at play here, and I can intellectually grasp them both. One is that an easy way to add darkness and tension to a story is to have your main character interact with a world which doesn&#8217;t recognise their morality, which is how we get all those kind of racist &#8220;I was ravished by a barbarian/sheikh/otherwise rich and dark-skinned man&#8221; stories (remind me to talk to you about <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2180276.The_Panther_and_the_Pearl" target="_blank"><strong>The Panther And The Pearl</strong></a> some time). And that&#8217;s not necessarily a bad thing in a fantasy world where you are dealing with beings that might have witnessed the greater part of human history. I do take the point that you might well not care so much about pesky human morals when you&#8217;ve been living off blood or sex or male tears or whatever for about a thousand years.</p>
<p>And, credit where it&#8217;s due, Laurell K. Hamilton does make some effort to deal with the effect this is having on Anita; she agonises, at least initially, over the detachment she feels from her humanity as she gets drawn deeper into the preternatural world. Hamilton doesn&#8217;t really take that conflict anywhere, which is a shame because it makes the whole thing feel a bit too insta-conflict for my liking, but she tries.</p>
<p>The considerably more disturbing thing is the second point, which is that this is supposed to be <em>hot</em>. We&#8217;ve touched on this before in <a href="/2013/04/23/hopeless-reimantic-3-pack-mentality/" target="_blank">the column on alpha males</a>, but one thing that I think I missed there is actually what I find grossest about this particular fantasy &#8211; that being threatened or coerced, either physically or by other means, into being with someone is supposed to be evidence of part of a woman&#8217;s power and mystique. It&#8217;s not that these guys are proto-rapists, no &#8211; it&#8217;s that women are so damned irresistible that they overwhelm men&#8217;s judgement and common sense. Basically, they are the full moon to every man&#8217;s <a href="http://pervocracy.blogspot.co.uk/2012/08/the-myth-of-boner-werewolf.html" target="_blank">boner werewolf</a> (link NSFW).</p>
<p>There is an element of pick-up artistry that states that when you overcome LMR (last minute resistance, usually to sex) you&#8217;re actually doing the woman a favour, because you&#8217;re taking the responsibility out of her hands. She can&#8217;t be a slut, because she&#8217;s not in control; you&#8217;re preserving her purity while still giving her the sex she wants. That is gross and messed-up and a terrible bit of rape apologia, but it&#8217;s the same kind of logic that I&#8217;m seeing here; it&#8217;s a way to skirt around having Anita own her own sexuality. She can&#8217;t help it! She&#8217;s just got this <em>energy</em>!</p>
<p>And on that note&#8230;</p>
<h3>2) There&#8217;s hella slut-shaming.</h3>
<p>It took me a while to realise this. I started out with <strong>Danse Macabre</strong>, but the more of these books I read, the more I became convinced that having lots of sex was only okay for Anita Blake, and by extension her harem of men, because Anita Blake has sex because she somehow <em>has</em> to &#8211; which is a pretty icky sentence to begin with, by the way. </p>
<p>Anita starts out the series not believing in pre-marital sex. She ends up having quite a lot of it, but there&#8217;s never a sense that she revises that belief, which would be really interesting if it didn&#8217;t have such weird implications for the other women in the books. Anita has sex because of deep love, a deep sense of obligation (erk) and/or because she is a succubus. Metaphysical events or very strong emotion compel her to bone, and the fact that she ends up enjoying it immensely is somehow a coincidence, which is possibly the strangest permutation of the forced seduction trope I&#8217;ve ever seen. </p>
<p>And even that would be okay, were it not for the fact that every single other woman in the books who has sex for such a frivolous reason as the fact she just enjoys it is painted as either a) shallow and heinous, b) mentally unstable, or c) both.</p>
<p>Which brings me neatly to:</p>
<h3>3) There is gratuitous use of mental illness as a plot device.</h3>
<p>Basically every villain is crazy. And there&#8217;s Nathaniel, her second shapeshifter love interest, who is super-submissive and utterly traumatised by his past and hey, did we mention he&#8217;s kinky too and can take more pain than anybody else? Because he&#8217;s damaged?</p>
<p>Urgh. If I had to hazard, I&#8217;d say this follows a lot of the same logic that we see in point 1), but let&#8217;s just be honest here; this isn&#8217;t just offensive, it&#8217;s lazy writing, in the same way that blaming serious criminal offences or terrorism on mental illness is lazy journalism. It&#8217;s a way to avoid grappling seriously with what could actually be some pretty compelling issues and it&#8217;s depressing me. So let&#8217;s move on to our final point:</p>
<h3>4) Gender essentialism and homophobia.</h3>
<p>Hoo boy.</p>
<p>This is a pretty interesting one, actually, because the characters around Anita Blake actually call her on some of it, and it doesn&#8217;t work. I skipped a quotation for mental illness and point 2, so we can have two in here because it&#8217;s my column and I make the rules.</p>
<p>I feel like I need to include this one because it&#8217;s in <strong>Shutdown</strong>, which was actually only released <a href="http://www.laurellkhamilton.org/2013/10/shutdown-press-release/" target="_blank">a few weeks ago</a> &#8211; and, again, in fairness to Ms Hamilton, releasing it the way she did was a nice idea (it was a freebie because of the US government shutdown, in solidarity with government workers who were off without pay). </p>
<p>The story itself is interesting purely because the premise is so flawed: Richard, Anita Blake&#8217;s erstwhile lover, now-Top, is engaged to another woman, and apparently has chosen only now to mention to her that he&#8217;s poly and wants to see other people for wild kinky sex. His fiancee has a problem with this &#8211; not, you understand, because somehow <em>they have got as far as being engaged without this ever having come up</em>, but because she&#8217;s a crazy jealous harpy who can&#8217;t wrap her narrow mind around non-monogamy or sex that isn&#8217;t vanilla. </p>
<p>I liked precisely nobody in this short, but Anita least of all:</p>
<blockquote><p>I hadn&#8217;t had to endure this much small talk in years. We&#8217;d learned a lot about one another, but unless we were looking to date, I didn&#8217;t see the point.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Men understood that sometimes you didn&#8217;t want to smile, but you weren&#8217;t mad either, while women expect other women to be pleasant, and if you&#8217;re not they think you don&#8217;t like them. There are so many reasons that most of my friends are men. </p>
<p>&#8211; Laurell K. Hamilton, <strong>Shutdown</strong>, pp.6-8</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh, Ms Blake, you charmer. I could quote this little piece all day, actually, because it shows you a lot about the mess of contradictions that is gender portrayal in these books, but &#8211; you guys, I can&#8217;t. I just can&#8217;t. I think my brain is leaking out of my ears.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s finish up, then, with one final quote, and my witty and insightful riposte.</p>
<p>Look, okay, this isn&#8217;t even close to the most homophobia I&#8217;ve ever seen in fiction, or the worst. I&#8217;ll give you that I really do think this was&#8230; misguided, but well-intentioned. For what that&#8217;s worth. But the fact remains that I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve seen a non-heterosexual character in the Anita Blake series who wasn&#8217;t sex-obsessed, mentally ill (see above) and/or just plain old mean. </p>
<p>Anita Blake herself later gets a girlfriend and starts identifying as &#8220;heteroflexible&#8221;, which is a completely valid label that I don&#8217;t wish to detract from, but in this case reads to me sort of like she&#8217;s just started adding &#8220;no homo&#8221; to the end of all of her sentences about fancying women.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s&#8230;well, this. For context: some of Anita&#8217;s male partners are bisexual. She has just had a threesome with one of them and another man, which she feels gives her incontrovertible proof that he is, in fact, also into guys. The other men around her do not seem bothered by this revelation. Which prompts the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In college I had a friend, a girlfriend, a girl who was a friend. She and I went shopping together. Slept over at each other&#8217;s dorm rooms. I undressed in front of her because she was a girl. Then toward the end of college she told me she was gay. We were still friends, but she went into that guy category for me. You don&#8217;t undress in front of people who see you as a sex object. You don&#8217;t sleep with them, or&#8230;oh, hell.&#8221; I looked up at Micah. &#8220;Won&#8217;t it weird you out to sleep nude beside him now?&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8211; Laurell K. Hamilton, <strong>Danse Macabre</strong>, p.188.</p></blockquote>
<p>Funny story: my original response to this paragraph was a lot more colourful. I&#8217;m going to try and discuss it briefly, coherently and without expletives.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure which bothers me more, here: the idea that being attracted to members of one gender means you&#8217;re attracted to <em>all</em> members of one gender, or Anita&#8217;s assumption that everybody around her is going to have the same weird hang-ups as she is. I will say, though, that reading this made me briefly see red. You can come hang out with my friends, Anita Blake&#8217;s token lesbian college friend! They&#8217;ll hug you! Even the straight women!</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m struggling to articulate is why, exactly, this paragraph was the exact point that I fully lost patience with the series, because in context it&#8217;s not actually so bad. Anita is laughed at for her small-mindedness, and they all go to sleep naked and it&#8217;s fine.</p>
<p>Except&#8230;</p>
<p>Except that <em>this never really goes away</em>. There&#8217;s a kind of false normal here that you&#8217;re not supposed to stray from, and then even when Anita does, all that happens it that it gets this veneer of &#8220;exotic sexy sex stuff&#8221; that makes the books transgressive and naughty. It doesn&#8217;t read like a straight-up sex fantasy. I definitely don&#8217;t buy that it&#8217;s an honest exploration of sexuality in fiction. I&#8217;m not even sure that it&#8217;s Laurell K. Hamilton bragging about her sex life with extra fantasy elements.</p>
<p>The best way I can describe it is that it reads like a zoo exhibit, if people who have a lot of sex could actually literally <em>be</em> zoo exhibits. It doesn&#8217;t challenge normative attitudes, is what I&#8217;m saying. It takes the stuff Ms Hamilton describes as &#8220;too underground for the mainstream&#8221; and sticks it behind a thick layer of societal assumptions-reinforced glass, so that you can look at it without getting your brain too into all the sex stuff. And then you can go home at the end feeling like you&#8217;ve learned something. And perhaps a little icky.</p>
<p>And that brings us to the end of <strong>Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter</strong>. If you enjoyed this column and want me to do more like it, consider dropping me a comment, because the experience was&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;it was&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;it&#8217;s been an experience, guys. And now, if you&#8217;ll excuse me, I&#8217;m off to read something else. Something gentle, with no sex in it whatsoever. Maybe some Catherynne M. Valente.</p>
<p>See you next time!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[When the call came around for horror-themed posts for autumn and winter, I decided to take on the Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter series.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Early December. The leaves have fallen, the sky has darkened. Rain lashes the windows. Doors yawn open before you; blackness whispers chill secrets into your hair, and your worst nightmares take shape &#8216;twixt the smoky trees, taunting, menacing. Waiting.</p>
<p>Basically, at the time of writing it was the month with Hallowe&#8217;en in it, and I hate to waste a perfectly good theme. So without further ado, allow me to welcome you to <strong>Hopeless Reimantic Presents</strong>! In this column I&#8217;ll be going in-depth into the works of specific authors who are in &#8211; or cross over into &#8211; the romance genre. In the spirit of the season, I thought we&#8217;d take a look at the stuff of nightmares: let&#8217;s talk about Laurell K. Hamilton. More specifically, let&#8217;s talk about <strong>Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter</strong>, one of the weirdest and most controversial series I&#8217;ve ever interacted with.</p>

<p>First of all, a slightly complicated preface. Before I ever picked up an Anita Blake book I knew quite a lot about them, and while I&#8217;d like to stress that I&#8217;m here to talk about the <em></em>books and <em>not</em> Ms Hamilton herself I feel like I&#8217;ll be remiss if I don&#8217;t at least give a quick summary of some common controversies surrounding the series and its author.</p>
<p>I first became aware of Laurell K. Hamilton via Anne Rice. Well, not Anne Rice herself, but <a href="http://www.journalfen.net/community/fandom_wank/515245.html?nc=911" target="_blank">the now-infamous Anne Rice Author Tantrum</a>, which I arrived at a couple of years after the fact and consequently saw linked to&#8230;Laurell K. Hamilton&#8217;s <a href="http://eragon-sporkings.wikispaces.com/Hamiltons_Response_To_Negative_Readers" target="_blank">similarly poor handling of criticism</a> (link to a Wikispace article, as the original blog post has vanished).</p>
<p>Hamilton isn&#8217;t quite as vitriolic in her I Can&#8217;t Believe Not Everyone Likes My Book-ness, but she&#8217;s still pretty irritatingly condescending, although I do agree with her that if someone&#8217;s taking their book up to you so that you can sign it, then opening with &#8220;I hated this one and what you&#8217;ve done with the series&#8221; is kind of poor form.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s since made a name for herself on Twitter for calling her critics <a href="https://twitter.com/LKHamilton/status/200273311530360832" target="_blank">sexually frustrated</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/LKHamilton/status/200272147720056832" target="_blank">jealous</a> <a href="http://lkh-lashouts.livejournal.com/562684.html#cutid1" target="_blank">wannabes</a>, and a name for herself among readers and other writers for<a href="http://mybookgoggles.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/authors-behaving-badly-laurell-k.html" target="_blank"> not handling criticism well </a>and <a href="http://www.likesbooks.com/cgi-bin/bookReview.pl?BookReviewId=9647" target="_blank">shamelessly inserting herself into her books</a>. The <a href="http://lkh-lashouts.livejournal.com/" target="_blank">LKH_lashouts</a> community on LiveJournal keeps a nice catalogue of her various posts, blogs and misdemeanours, and I&#8217;ve been on it all day, which might explain why my brain is starting to feel too heavy for my skull.</p>
<p>As a lot of you probably aren&#8217;t familiar with what makes the Anita Blake series so divisive in the first place, I&#8217;ll give you a quick, neutral description to start us off (don&#8217;t worry, we&#8217;ll get to the incoherent ranting later). The <strong>Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter</strong> series started out as a kind of monster-of-the-week dealio, with some romance in it but not a huge deal. The romantic &#8211; and sexual &#8211; content of the books got a lot more page time as the series went on, and the tenth book in the series, <strong>Narcissus In Chains</strong>, saw a metaphysical event turn Anita Blake into a succubus who needs sex to survive.</p>
<p>Subsequent books are arguably more &#8220;paranormal erotica&#8221; than anything else, and the last time I checked in with Ms Blake she was in a polyamorous relationship with five guys and happy as a clam. This, and the fact that a lot of the events of Anita Blake&#8217;s love life seem to mirror the author&#8217;s, have led to accusations that Laurell K. Hamilton is using Anita to brag about how much sex she&#8217;s having, and have turned a lot of readers off the series.</p>
<p>The upshot of all this is that this time three months ago, your intrepid romance novel enthusiast knew <em>of</em> Laurell K. Hamilton and had formed a pretty strong impression of the <strong>Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter</strong> books &#8211; but had never actually picked one up. So when the call came around for horror-themed posts for autumn and winter, and I decided to take them on, I was&#8230;nervous, but excited. Here was a series with a strong female lead which had lost popularity as the erotic content had upped and the quality of the writing had deteriorated &#8211; the stuff of feminist bad-porn-lovers&#8217; wildest dreams, right?</p>
<p>All that given due consideration, I wanted to approach the series with an open mind, but I didn&#8217;t want to actually buy any of the books because a) this isn&#8217;t somebody I want to give money to and b) there are approximately bleventeen of the damned things and I don&#8217;t have a job. I put out a call on my social medias for donations to the cause.</p>
<p>Three weeks later, I had <em>seventeen Laurell K. Hamilton books</em>. And with various deadlines coming up? I had a week to read them in.</p>
<p>Some would have panicked. Some would have faltered. Some would have done several noisy circuits of the living room, sobbing about the hilarious injustice of life. Some would have said, &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s okay, I don&#8217;t have to read all of these, I&#8217;m not <em>that</em> much of a masochist&#8221;, picked out a selection, and called it a day.</p>
<p>I did all of these things except the last one. Here&#8217;s how I got on. The following are my initial notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Initial thoughts on LKH: The Anita Blake series is not as bad as I thought it would be for the reasons I was told I would hate it, but it is creepingly terrible in ways I didn&#8217;t really anticipate.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Day 3 of LKH immersion. Eyes gritty. Legs heavy. Some subcranial tenderness. Seem to have &#8220;What Does The Fox Say&#8221; stuck in my head.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Laurell K. Hamilton Immersion Week, Day 5. Sore throat, some muscle ache. Have been reading some of the earlier books, which are much better even if I don&#8217;t like murder mysteries that much. I&#8217;m sad that her deep love of stuffed penguins seems to be worn away by all the sexy sexy sex she starts having in a book or so&#8217;s time. What happened to Sigmund, Anita? Did Sigmund mean nothing to you? Developing protective feelings for all penguins.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>LKH Immersion Week, Day 6. I&#8230;I just don&#8217;t even know anymore, you guys. Just leave me alone. I&#8217;m going shopping for leather.</p></blockquote>
<p>By the end of the week I&#8217;d contracted a stomach virus, although the medical jury is still out on whether or not this was a symptom of my burgeoning lycanthropy. The next full moon isn&#8217;t until December 17th, so I guess we&#8217;ll find out then.</p>
<p>This is going to be a difficult bit of analysis to write, because &#8211; well, I read seventeen books, you guys. I&#8217;m having to be extremely choosy about which books I quote and why. Maybe I&#8217;ll upload a list of Supplementary Supportive Material, but, um, I wouldn&#8217;t count on it.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, dear readers, here&#8217;s the thing: <em>I didn&#8217;t hate these books the way I was expecting to</em>.</p>
<p>Look, fourteen-year-old me assumed I&#8217;d hate these books because they were a self-insert Mary-Sue-type series that ended with the main character having far too much ridiculously improbable sex and being the best at everything. Fourteen-year-old me was also scared of non-monogamy, kind of selective in her feminism and a lot more judgmental. Fourteen-year-old me would probably have written this bit of the article in a far more entertainingly vitriolic manner.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you&#8217;re stuck with twenty-three-year-old me, and twenty-three-year-old me doesn&#8217;t have a problem with any of these things on principle. Look, okay, self-insert Mary-Sues aren&#8217;t my cup of tea, and I can see why a sharp rise (hurr) in sexual content in a series which basically had no sexual content at all for the first four books might turn readers off &#8211; but those two facts don&#8217;t make either of those authorial decisions inherently wrong.</p>
<p>For all her flaws (and she has many &#8211; and I&#8217;m not just talking about the fun kind of flaws that make a character seem real, either) Anita Blake has some nice bits of refreshingly feminist outlook. One of the best story arcs in the series comes in <strong>Danse Macabre,</strong> when she has a pregnancy scare. She talks it over with all of her partners, one of them says he&#8217;ll stay at home and raise the baby so that she can keep working, and another says he&#8217;ll marry her:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Jesus, Mary and Joseph, Richard, is that all you think it takes to fix this? Marry me so the baby won&#8217;t be a bastard, and it&#8217;s all better?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see anyone else offering marriage,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s because they know I&#8217;ll say no. Every other man in my life understands that this isn&#8217;t about marriage. It&#8217;s about the fact that we may have created a little person. And we need to do whatever is best for that little person. How will marrying anyone make this work better? &#8230; What do you think having a baby will do to me, Richard? Do you think just because I have a baby I&#8217;ll become this other person? This softer, gentler person? Is that what you think?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8211; Laurell K. Hamilton, <strong>Danse Macabre</strong>, pp. 162-164</p></blockquote>
<p>Whatever else I think about Anita Blake the character, I wholeheartedly rooted for her throughout this story arc. Would it have been unrealistic for her to keep being a federal agent who has all the sex and also a baby? Sure, maybe. But this is a fantasy series and clearly delineated as such, so if that&#8217;s too much suspension of disbelief for you then <a href="http://fuckyeahscifiwomenofcolour.tumblr.com/post/37413846476/author-scott-lynch-responds-to-a-critic-of-the" target="_blank">allow me to refer you to Scott Lynch</a>.</p>
<p>Regarding the non-monogamy&#8230;well, there are not a lot of mainstream series that won&#8217;t even touch non-monogamy with a bargepole, and twenty-three-year-old me quite likes the normalisation of non-mono and monogamous relationships here. What I&#8217;m basically trying to say here is that if Laurell K. Hamilton wants to chronicle her sexy adventures as Badass The Vampire Slayer (And Harem) and people want to read it, I&#8217;m honestly okay with that. I wish she&#8217;d be more honest about what her books are (she seems to do a lot of If You Don&#8217;t Like It You&#8217;re Just Too Mainstream For My Awesomeness-ing), but &#8211; whatever. Fine.</p>
<p>However. The fact that I didn&#8217;t hate these books for the reasons I&#8217;d assumed doesn&#8217;t mean that they in no way made me want to tear my own eyes out. Unfortunately this article is skittering dangerously close to its word limit, so stand by for <strong>Part Two</strong>, in which I attempt to explain why cleanly and concisely but inevitably deteriorate into wordless, feeble sobbing.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t wait! See you then.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is no secret, to this or any section of the internet, that I love werewolves. Like, <em>really</em> love werewolves. I love werewolves with a fiery burning passion that glows with an embarrassing ardour. I&#8217;ve been into werewolves since I was old enough to pick up books about them. When I doodle mindlessly, it&#8217;s snarling werewolf faces that I draw by default, and when I draw to relax, the things I find easiest and most therapeutic to draw are werewolves. I love the twisted, terrifying combination of human and wolf anatomy. I like to draw thick, maned necks and sharp, curved teeth. I like to draw hand-paws, half human and half wolf, and I like to draw big, burning eyes and long, soft ears.</p>
<p>I hasten to add that I&#8217;m not a furry.</p>

They&#8217;re great, big, vicious monsters that will pull a person to shreds with their claws, and yet can disguise themselves very effectively as the thing they prey on to hide amongst them. There&#8217;s lots of story potential lurking in the legend of the lycanthrope. They&#8217;re transformation, liberation, sexuality, secrets, puberty, forbidden passion, rage, hunger and loneliness all at once. The idea of a human that can literally turn into a terrifying predator and go on a rampage has been inherent in legends and folklore since before we could write, probably because of the storytelling and thematic potential in such a creature. What <em>can&#8217;t</em> you do with a werewolf? (Still not a furry.)</p>
<p>So I went to see <strong>Red Riding Hood</strong> because, well, it&#8217;s a werewolf film and I have this biological imperative when it comes to werewolf films, and also because I was interested to see what they&#8217;d do with them. It&#8217;s directed by <strong>Catherine Hardwicke</strong>, also responsible for the heinous pile of shite that was <strong>Twilight</strong>, which made me cautious &#8211; but I still wanted to see what threads of the werewolf myth would be re-spun for the <strong>Twilight</strong> generation. I&#8217;m all for innovative takes. And, you know, with all that potential behind the werewolf, surely they&#8217;d find something fun to run with, right?</p>
<p>Wrong.</p>
<p>Wrong, wrong, wrong, oh god, wrong. I didn&#8217;t set my bar particularly high in the first place because, you know, <strong>Twilight</strong> (do I really need to go into why I don&#8217;t like that franchise? Really?) but <strong>Red Riding Hood</strong> neatly limboed right underneath.</p>

<p>The setting is what you&#8217;d expect: pseudo-Medieval village in the middle of an unrealistically spiky forest, with an insulting gender dimorphic, binary society. The characters are nothing more than pages from <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomePage">TV Tropes</a> printed off and pasted onto cardboard cut-outs. The dialogue is emotionless tedious drivel that I&#8217;ve seen beaten in artistry by ten-year-olds writing about their lunchboxes and the plot wouldn&#8217;t know what &#8220;innovation&#8221; meant if the OED definition was carved into the side of its face with a screwdriver.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know about you, but I am hopeless &#8211; absolutely hopeless &#8211; at being bored. I get violent. It&#8217;s a dreadful personality flaw, and really I should be more patient, but if I find myself stuck doing, watching or listening to something that bores me, I get enraged to the point of being pugnacious.</p>
<p>Half an hour in, and I was seriously considering starting a fight in the auditorium.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s as simplistic and colourful as a child&#8217;s toy. I know it&#8217;s aimed at the prepubescent, hormonal tweenagers that take <strong>Twilight</strong> as seriously as people take their religious texts, but it&#8217;s so monodimensional that I found myself Photoshopping in new, imaginary dimensions just to keep myself from falling asleep.</p>
<p>When can we all get as bored as I am of this heterocentric one-girl-two-guys trope? The story, instead of revolving around something interesting and mutable (like, say, werewolves), revolved around the personality vacuum that passed as the lead character (<strong>Amanda Seyfried</strong> being fought over by HER ONE TRUE LOVE and HER FINANCIALLY VIABLE FIANCÉ (<strong>Shiloh Fernadez </strong>and <strong>Max Irons</strong>). Neither of whom was a werewolf. And neither was she. It was like the bloody werewolf was an inconvenient distraction from the real &#8220;meat&#8221; of the Fisher Price plot.</p>
<p>It did, however, keep me guessing, if just because I couldn&#8217;t believe how intellect-insultingly bland it was. &#8220;Ooh, the werewolf is going to be her One True Love boy,&#8221; I thought, initially. &#8220;It&#8217;ll be an exploration of forbidden passion and how lust can turn you into a monster.&#8221; A well-trodden, predictable and dreadfully slut-shaming path, but at least it was werewolf-centric.</p>
<p>But it wasn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Disappointed, I then thought, &#8220;Okay, it&#8217;ll be her grandmother, and it&#8217;ll be a sisters-doing-it-for-themselves female sexuality tribal-loyalties thing. Look, they&#8217;ve even colour-coded her, her mum and her grandma in transcendental Virgin Mary blue!&#8221; But no. No, nothing that complex or potentially interesting from a feminist perspective.</p>
<p>It was, in fact, neither of these. The werewolf part of the plot &#8211; and I have no idea why I&#8217;m being so careful not to spoil it for you &#8211; chose the most boring, incidental and lazy option that it could possibly find, and didn&#8217;t even bother meshing it into the love-triangle schtick. It was Scotch-taped on like an afterthought, as if just to get a bit of mileage out of the &#8220;STAY AWAY FROM ME I AM BAD FOR YOU&#8221; unattainable-boy routine that made bloody <strong><em> </em>Twilight</strong> so popular.</p>
<p>And after all that, there was only one rampage! It was a good rampage, however, because there was lots of the werewolf smashing stuff, biting people&#8217;s arms off and leaping across rooftops &#8211; but there was no blood. In fact, this was the most bloodless werewolf film I have ever seen. It was about as horrific and monstrous as a Mr Men book. I felt betrayed. But more than betrayal, I felt pity. Perhaps they didn&#8217;t know how to make fake blood? I considered writing to the director and sending her my tried-and-tested recipe for realistic fake blood, but then realised that this might encourage her to make more films and no-one needs that.</p>
<p>Pretty werewolf, though, if a bit plasticine-y. And there was Gary Oldman being a fiendish, villainous priest, and that&#8217;s definitely something I can get behind in an extremely visceral sense.</p>
<p><em>The artist would like to apologise for the lack of illustrations accompanying this review. The reasons for this are twofold: firstly, he is going on holiday tomorrow morning. Secondly, he doesn&#8217;t think Miranda would ever forgive him for just filling an entire article with werewolves doing random things, like ironing.</em></p>
<h3>YOU SHOULD SEE THIS FILM BECAUSE:</h3>
<ul>
<li>It has a nice werewolf in</li>
<li>Gary Oldman is on Level 5 Ham and god help me but I&#8217;d do him lopsided</li>
<li>The soundtrack is pretty lush</li>
</ul>
<h3>YOU SHOULD NOT SEE THIS FILM BECAUSE:</h3>
<ul>
<li>You could make a better, more engaging story with a set of MegaBlocks dragons</li>
<li>Angela Carter already did the Red Riding Hood theme a thousand times better with<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Company_of_Wolves"><strong> The Company Of Wolves</strong></a></li>
<li>It makes <strong>Twilight</strong> look like a seminal feminist masterpiece</li>
<li>Watch <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_Soldiers_film"><strong>Dog Soldiers</strong></a> instead</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><br />
Right! That&#8217;s it for us until after Easter <del>and the bloody Royal Wedding</del>. We&#8217;re taking a quick holiday breather, but we&#8217;ll be back after the Bank Holidays, following on from this review, with a week of fairytale-themed posts! See you on the other side&#8230; </strong></p>
