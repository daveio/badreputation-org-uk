					<description><![CDATA[Here's my attempt at a feminist Christmas stocking! Woo!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>HEY READERS. I&#8217;m actually, due to some real life $stuff, staying with my family earlier than planned, meaning that some of the stuff I&#8217;d have photographed for this post I&#8217;ve not been able to, but here&#8217;s my makeshift effort:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/XMASBR2.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="9133" data-permalink="/2011/12/22/a-very-badrep-christmas-miranda/xmasbr2/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/XMASBR2.jpg?fit=2592%2C1936&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="2592,1936" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.8&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;iPhone 4&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1324576967&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;3.85&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;1000&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.066666666666667&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="XMASBR2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/XMASBR2.jpg?fit=300%2C224&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/XMASBR2.jpg?fit=1024%2C764&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-9133" title="XMASBR2" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/XMASBR2-1024x764.jpg?resize=574%2C428" alt="Photo showing blue christmas stocking surrounded by books, CDs and DVDs, by Miranda" width="574" height="428" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/XMASBR2.jpg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/XMASBR2.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/XMASBR2.jpg?w=401&amp;ssl=1 401w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/XMASBR2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>The stocking was made by my mum in timeless 1980s acid brights. Some things basically NEVER go out of fashion, and let me tell you, a turquoise, pink, yellow and orange felt medley is one of those things. Talking of classic, yes, that is an original <a href="http://www.ponylandpress.com/mip/merrytreat.shtml">My Little Pony</a> guarding the stocking.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Immediately behind her is a pretty swish-packaged edition of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Ella-Fitzgerald-Sings-Porter-Songbook/dp/B0000047EG"><strong>Ella Fitzgerald Sings The Cole Porter Songbook</strong></a>, which was originally released in 1956 and went into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2000. I love the image of her on the front. She looks like she&#8217;s taking precisely no crap from anybody. In a similar vein, to the left of that we&#8217;ve got <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Essential-Billie-Holiday/dp/B000077JRZ"><strong>The Essential Billie Holiday</strong></a>, which is a three-disc gateway to the sublime.</li>
<li>Jon Klassen&#8217;s <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/childrens-books-site/video/2011/sep/07/hatback-trailer"><strong>I Want My Hat Back</strong></a> was our Markgraf&#8217;s Christmas present to me this year. So beloved of the internet has it become, it has an entry on <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-want-my-hat-back">KnowYourMeme</a>, and I&#8217;m including it because throughout the entire text of the book only one animal is gendered as &#8220;he&#8221; and the rest are up to the reader to gender &#8211; if they need gendering at all. After the <a href="http://maxbarry.com/2011/07/08/news.html">Dogs and Smurfs debate</a>, I reckon that&#8217;s a good thing. It&#8217;s hardly stridently feminist, but it&#8217;s very good at not prescribing anything but a story. The second reason I&#8217;m including it is the general sense of righteous fury in the <a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-sx5r1g7-nk0/TsZ7qDsmVSI/AAAAAAAA6TY/OvfRJ__uJ3o/s640/best_story_book_ever_11.jpg"><em>I HAVE SEEN MY HAT</em> moment</a>. I&#8217;ve had a dozen political click-moments which definitely come under the heading <em>I HAVE SEEN MY HAT.</em> If you get what I mean.</li>
<li>From bears to kangaroos, next to that is <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Tank-Girl-Odyssey-Peter-Milligan/dp/1900097079"><strong>Tank Girl: The Odyssey</strong></a>. I&#8217;m actually (SHOCK) quite new to actually reading TG but <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/08/03/tank-girl-vs-my-enemies/">here&#8217;s Sarah J persuading me.</a></li>
<li>And next to that we&#8217;ve got <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Serious-Concerns-Wendy-Cope/dp/0571167055"><strong>Serious Concerns</strong></a> by poet Wendy Cope, which contains important lines such as <em>Bloody Christmas, here again. / Let us raise a loving cup. / Peace on earth, goodwill to men / And let them do the washing-up.</em> and <em>My cat is dead / But I have decided not to make a big / tragedy out of it</em> &#8211; but also some really touching poems. You can read some of them <a href="http://albalondres.com/2011/04/poems-from-serious-concerns-by-wendy-cope/">here</a> &#8211; I remember <strong>Flowers</strong> and <strong>Defining The Problem</strong> really struck chords with me.</li>
<li>WEIGHTIER TOMES: <a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/books/2010/05/rowbotham-women-dreamers-20th"><strong>Dreamers of a New Day: Women Who Invented the 20th Century</strong></a> by Sheila Rowbotham, which came out this year. And William Golding: not an obvious choice for a feminist blog, perhaps, but <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Double-Tongue-William-Golding/dp/0571178030"><strong>The Double Tongue</strong></a>, his last novel, retrieved in draft form from a drawer and published posthumously, is told entirely from the point of view of the Delphic Oracle, and I loved it. (It&#8217;s much more enjoyable than <strong>Lord of the Flies</strong>.)</li>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Pre-Raphaelite-Women-Artists-Jan-Marsh/dp/0500281041"><strong>Pre-Raphaelite Women Artists</strong></a>: because the Pre-Raphaelite <em>Brother</em>hood was not the <em>whole</em> hood. Tired of women being erased from mainstream art history (for more on which, read <a href="http://womenshistorymonth.wordpress.com/resources/women-and-series/women-and-art/where-are-women-in-the-history-of-art/"> this</a>), Jan Marsh and Pamela Gerrish-Nunn&#8217;s glossy book puts the Sisterhood back on record, with wonderful illustrations.</li>
<li><em>Who&#8217;s Queen?</em> Nurse your Boxing Day hangover with Miranda Richardson&#8217;s finest moments on <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Blackadder-Complete-Collection-Rowan-Atkinson/dp/B000ASALUQ"><strong>Blackadder: The Complete Collection</strong></a>. (I recently rewatched <strong>Blackadder the Third</strong> and apart from her turn as a squirrel-shooting highwaywoman, I also loved Helen Atkinson-Wood&#8217;s supreme comic timing as housekeeper <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mrs_Miggins">Mrs Miggins</a>.</li>
<li>Forgive the big beardy patriarch figure looming in the background, but in these days of strikes and kettles, Karl Marx is looking good on everything. And in the absence of a Rosa Luxemburg shirt, he&#8217;s looking best of all on this tee. LOOK AT HIS FACE. HE IS UNIMPRESSED. Let&#8217;s not have the whole Commodification of Marxism debate now &#8211; the shirt&#8217;s ethically sourced by Fair Wear Foundation (a thing to look out for, or you&#8217;ll defeat the point somewhat) and you can purchase one from <a href="http://savagelondon.com/"><strong>Savage London</strong></a> who have a shop in London&#8217;s Covent Garden. And you could do worse than wrap it around Terry Eagleton&#8217;s latest book on the topic, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Why-Marx-Right-Terry-Eagleton/dp/0300169434"><strong>Why Marx Was Right</strong></a>, an accessible and funny primer for lefty political activists of any stripe (and much easier to read with aforementioned Yule Hangover than <strong>Das Kapital</strong>, eh).</li>
<li>Oh, and TEA. Everybody needs tea. Twinings are doing some cute tins which I kind of wanted to graffiti when I saw them in the shop with &#8220;Psst! Riots, not diets!&#8221; and &#8220;Priscilla! Are we fair trade, do you know?&#8221; so the ladies could chat to each other. But otherwise, any tea will do.</li>
