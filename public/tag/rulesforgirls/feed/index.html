<p>Twitter hashtags make conversations and exchanges that would previously have been invisible to anyone not involved in them available to everyone. You can stick your head out of your own online bubble and peer into someone else’s. If you listen in to a conversation on a bus or in a bar you’ll often get a similar effect, and if you ever share a train carriage with a stag party you may well overhear some of the same sentiments.</p>
<p>There are a lot of possibilities and interesting conversations growing out of this (here’s a good <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/10/14/twitter-cross-cultural/">Mashable post</a> about cross-cultural conversations) but it can be uncomfortable having a front row seat for the social reproduction of gender stereotypes in real time.</p>
<h3>Tweeting gender</h3>
<p>[Apologies to any gender theorists out there for this next bit, in which I will be oversimplifying some complex ideas.]</p>
<p>[Oh and just to be clear, when I&#8217;m talking about men and women I don&#8217;t mean <em>all</em> men or<em> all</em> women, and I know those categories are far more fluid than our friends the hashtaggers would like to admit.]</p>
<p>Part of the Great Promise of the internet was that in the gap between your avatar and your fingertips on the keyboard all kinds of subversive genderfuck fun was to be had. And it is being had (hooray!), but there’s a tangible disappointment in some areas that the web is used as much to police and reinforce gendered ideas of appropriate behaviour as it is to undermine them. Social networks, it turns out, are simply another arena in which to enact and consolidate gender identity. Like the bus, like the pub.</p>
<p>And a big part of successfully Being A Man or Being A Woman is policing the behaviour of others. By laying down the rules you’re letting everyone know you understand them. In fact you’re an expert. By calling out someone else on their inappropriate behaviour (for example, women that are ‘loud’ &#8211; how unfeminine!) you’re picking up gender points for yourself. And appropriate gender behaviour points <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=F7vd7JQ4zlcC&amp;pg=PA391&amp;lpg=PA391&amp;dq=appropriate+gender+behaviour+rewards&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oIgpBlhobo&amp;sig=FIG-3K8iC2TbO_Qb7Co11WKNNKY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=9WQ7TfrbFtOxhQfZ__zNCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">win prizes</a>!</p>
<p>You can see this in action in the huge numbers of women participating in sexist hashtags and imparting helpful advice to their own gender:</p>
<blockquote><p>#rulesforgirls stoppp being so easyyyy!</p>
<p>#ihatefemaleswho act like they in to sports</p>
<p>#agoodwoman sucks her mans dick w|. out no hesitation lOl.</p>
<p>#agoodwoman aims to please</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks for that. Now I&#8217;m all set. In another recent hashtag, #youneedanewboyfriend, large numbers of male and female Twitter users took the opportunity to remind everyone that male femininity = gay! Which as we all know = very bad indeed:</p>
<blockquote><p>
your man has more clothes with different shades of pink than you.#youneedanewboyfriend</p>
<p>If your man turns down sex from you, #youneedanewboyfriend</p>
<p>#youneedanewboyfriend If he knows all the words to every @ladygaga song out there #notnormal</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s not just about putting women in their place, it&#8217;s about keeping men in line as well. If you can do both that makes you the Manliest Man of all, and king of all you survey. The tweets I quoted in the first post are part of this process. On the one hand encouraging traditionally feminine behaviours, and on the other boosting the masculinity points of the men tweeting, and asserting their dominance and entitlement (consider yourself lucky if you missed #itaintrape – that one was Not Nice).</p>
<p>What I think is happening here is that a large number of people are using a new medium to do exactly what an even larger number of people have already been doing for centuries, millennia, even. What’s different is that the isolated conversations are being collected and shared on a global platform.</p>
<h3>What now?</h3>

<p>The flagrant misogyny of most of these trending topic  hashtag tweets makes me furiously angry. But I don&#8217;t find them shocking. I  think Germaine Greer is wrong on lots of things but right on this one:  “Women have very little idea of how much men hate them.” Well, now we have a handy index in our Twitter sidebar. The scale of the problem is intimidating, I agree, but being shocked  isn’t going to help.</p>
<p>The good news is we don&#8217;t need to start a cultural  revolution from scratch. There’s some excellent work already going  on: for example, <a href="http://www.womankind.org.uk/uk-schools.html">Womankind</a> and <a href="http://www.pinkstinks.co.uk/">PinkStinks</a> are challenging misogyny and sexist attitudes among young people (who seem like the obvious group to start with, to my mind).</p>
<p>There are also lots of truly wonderful online projects that are trying to break down some of these poisonous  stereotypes and ideas. BadRep is one, of course ;-) .  But another of my  favourites is <a href="http://genderfork.com/">Genderfork</a> – follow them on Twitter for the perfect antidote to all this #rulesforgirls/boys crap.</p>
<p>What else can we do? Mocking the hashtags is fun. Hijacking them is fun too. It might not overthrow the sexist idiot regime, but if it makes just one person stop and think then it&#8217;s surely worth it. Another blogger on the topic of hashtags suggested getting some  feminist hashtags circulating. Suggestions included #feminist and  #ilovemybody. That&#8217;d be nice for other feminists, but I can’t see how they’d have  very wide appeal, particularly because they don’t invite people to  personalise them.</p>
<p>So I’m going to end with a challenge: <strong>can we come up  with a funny, pro-feminist / genderfuck hashtag people might actually  use?</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you use Twitter, chances are you’ll have clicked on a hashtag listed under the ‘trending’ (i.e. most popular) topics sidebar at least once. And perhaps only once – I can see why you might never do it again, especially if you clicked on <strong>#rulesforgirls</strong> or <strong>#ihatefemaleswho</strong>.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of standard fare, from apparently male users. Apologies. They’re pretty grim.</p>
<blockquote><p>#aGOODWOMAN knows how to shut the fuck up!!!!!!</p>
<p>#agoodwoman is always ready to give head!</p>
<p>#Agoodwoman cooks for u when u get in from work and gets up and cooks breakfast when u leavin to go to work</p>
<p>when y&#8217;all cheat, expect for it to be over&#8230; when us men cheat, you have to be forgiving and give us another chance&#8230; #rulesforgirls</p>
<p>#rulesforgirls When we say we wana watch football, that means no cleaning,no talking,NO FORM OF INTERACTION.We will Chris Brown you.</p>
<p>#ihatefemaleswho slap they boyfriend thinkin he wont hit you back</p></blockquote>
<p>And my two favourites, from the same guy:</p>
<blockquote><p>#IHateFemales Who want to be men. God gave you the best gift ever bitch, acknowledge it!</p></blockquote>
<p>You tell her! Why on earth would she want to be a man? *scratches head*</p>
<blockquote><p>#IHateFemales Who don&#8217;t see the beauty in them &amp; still don&#8217;t take care of their bodies &amp; looking decent.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why can’t she see how beautiful she is? And maybe get a wax?</p>
<p>These make for depressing reading, and when you’re faced with a whole screenful and 60 more appear in a few minutes, it’s easy to feel hopeless.  But I don’t think what we’re watching is a misogynist Twitter takeover as some people have suggested. So what’s going on? I’ll start with some theories I have encountered and explain why I don’t think they’ll do as an answer.</p>
<h3>A) &#8220;There are just more sexist idiots on Twitter / the internet than in Real Life&#8221;</h3>
<p>I was at an event recently where Yasmin Alibhai-Brown spoke briefly about her recent <a href="http://www.pickledpolitics.com/archives/10743">run-in with Twitter</a>, and was disappointed that the insight she chose to pass on to the room of feminists was to be careful of using Twitter because it’s filling up with horrible geeky misogynists.</p>

<p>This comment on a blog post about hashtags clarified it for me: “I wish I understood how and why stupid hashtags become trending topics.”</p>
<p>Um. Because they’re popular?</p>
<p>Sorry everyone, I know you don’t want to hear this, but Twitter <em>is</em> people with misogynist views, at least if the trending topics are anything to go by. I would hazard that Twitter might feel like a feminist space that has been invaded by these &#8216;orrible &#8216;ashtags because you follow feminists. But we&#8217;re in the minority, just like in Real Life.</p>
<p>It’s much easier to craft your own media bubble online than offline, but it’s basically the same thing. If you read the <strong>Guardian</strong>, and hang out with other people who read the <strong>Guardian</strong>, then <em>Guardian</em>-y sort of opinions are going to appear to be the norm. Whereas the norm, in <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/dec/10/november-abcs-daily-star">circulation figures</a> at least, is actually the <strong>Sun</strong>. And then the <strong>Daily Mail</strong>.</p>
<p>Like I said, sorry.</p>
<h3>B) &#8220;Because black people are more sexist than white people&#8221;</h3>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Click on a sexist trending topic hashtag. Everyone in the hashtag stream is African American. Therefore…</p>
<p>Just, whoa there. Wait a second. Since when are ALL BLACK PEOPLE represented by a subsection of a social network? Following that logic you might think that every single white person owns an iPad. And besides, there’s plenty of misogyny to be found in ‘white’ hashtags streams too &#8211; some of the trolling on #mooreandme for example &#8211; and on Twitter in general. Sexism isn’t restricted to hashtags.</p>
<p>I’ve seen a number of people describe trending topics hashtag streams as the &#8216;dark undercurrent&#8217; or ‘dark side’ of Twitter.  I don’t think for a second that they were referring to the ethnicity of the users but I think it’s illuminating nonetheless. There are some fascinating (and sometimes toe-curling) discussions going on at the moment about ‘<a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2263462/">blacktags</a>’ or ‘<a href="http://whattamisaid.blogspot.com/2011/01/rejecting-notion-of-black-people.html">black people twitter</a>&#8216; which I recommend checking out, in particular this <a href="http://toomuchnick.com/post/173146454/shai-lays-down-science-on-the-black-people-on-twitter">comment</a>.</p>
<p>I think it’s safe to say that there is greater uptake of the attitudes and poses of hip hop and R&amp;B – genres notorious for misogyny and heavily polarised gender stereotypes &#8211; in the young African American twitter demographic than there is in, say, the middle-aged white British demographic, and that’s probably part of it.</p>
<p>But before you try and tell me that black people invented sexism (that must be why wholesome family entertainers like Jim Davidson hate them so much!) I recommend reading this 1994 article on <a href="http://race.eserver.org/misogyny.html">misogyny and gangsta rap</a> by bell hooks.</p>
<h3>C) &#8220;Because the web encourages people to be shitheads&#8221;</h3>
<p>There is definitely some truth in this one, and I can’t put it more eloquently than <a href="http://xkcd.com/438/">this</a>.</p>
<p>I think it’s also about the hashtag format. It’s a joke, and there’s an age-old link between cheap gags and crude gender stereotypes.
