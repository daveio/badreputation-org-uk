										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s that (second) most wonderful time of the year for another slew of &#8220;sexy lady&#8221; costumes. Around the country, women are being flogged some fairly ghastly red (or <a href="http://www.overstock.com/Health-Beauty/Womens-Sexy-Mrs.-Santa-Claus-3-piece-Costume/3668988/product.html?SID=popshops&#038;TRACK=affcjfeed&#038;PID=1487366&#038;AID=10654383&#038;CID=207442&#038;fp=F">perhaps even pink</a>) and white ensembles in the name of festive fun.<br />

<p>Seriously, <a href="http://www.allfancydress.com/SearchResult.aspx?QueryExpr=mrs%20santa&#038;resultspage=1">look</a> <a href="http://www.fancydressball.co.uk/christmas-fancy-dress/ladies-christmas-costumes.htm">at</a> <a href="http://www.partypacks.co.uk/santas-siren-costume-pid86172.html">this</a> shit.</p>
<p>Right, now I&#8217;ve shared my pain I feel ready to move on. Also, we&#8217;ve already covered this topic in some depth with <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/10/31/the-halloween-costume-interlude/">our</a> <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/10/31/the-halloween-costume-interludes-round-two-sassy-sassy-superheroes/">Halloween</a> <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/10/31/the-halloween-costume-interludes-final-round/">posts</a>, so I won&#8217;t go over it again, but if you <strong>really</strong> want to experience some more truly awful costume fails, then by all means, do type &#8220;mrs santa costume&#8221; into Google.</p>
<p>Just don&#8217;t blame me for the results.</p>
<p>But looking at all those dresses (and bikinis, and crop tops &#8211; seriously, crop tops &#8211; you come from the NORTH POLE!), once I&#8217;d finished washing my eyeballs, made me think about the female version of that jolly Christmas avatar&#8230;</p>
<h3>Mrs Santa Claus, step on down in all your glory.</h3>
<p>The origin of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Claus">Santa Claus</a> himself is a (turkey) bone of contention, with some camps claiming antecendents from folklore around 4th century saint <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Nicholas">St Nicholas</a> via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinterklaas">Sinterklaas</a>.</p>
<p>Some (including the brand itself) claim parts of the modern incarnation are <a href="http://www.thecoca-colacompany.com/heritage/cokelore_santa.html">entirely the creation of the Coca-Cola company</a>, especially the red and white costume.</p>
<p>What we can see is that as the Christmas holidays start to move from a solemn religious event to being increasingly secular and perhaps commercial, we lose the holy charitable man and get a fat jolly gift-giving man.</p>

<p>Possibly because it is not a good idea for single chaps to be portrayed as climbing into houses where small children lie sleeping, Santa gets a wife along with heteronormativity and a slew of other &#8220;traditional&#8221; family values that put the whole breaking and entering thing into a context of good, clean fun.</p>
<p>As a side note, I&#8217;d like to add that my father (also a fan of BadRep &#8211; hi Dad!) is currently being Santa for a local charity, so I&#8217;m not knocking the concepts of chaps who have families, fun or even enjoy climbing down chimneys. Though Dad, if you are reading, <strong>please don&#8217;t</strong>.</p>
<p>The closest thing I could find to a bio for our Mrs Claus online is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mrs._Claus">here on Wikipedia</a>. She arrives in what passes for the social media sphere of the mid to late 1800s, roughly the same time that we get <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Visit_from_St._Nicholas"><strong>The Night Before Christmas</strong></a> and the <a href="http://www.billcasselman.com/wintergram_archive/nast_santa.htm">drawings of Thomas Nast</a>, premiering as the unamed wife in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katharine_Lee_Bates">Katherine Lee Bates&#8217;s</a> poem <strong>Goody Santa Claus on a Sleigh Ride</strong>.</p>
<p>Wiki&#8217;s entry on Santa himself says: </p>
<blockquote><p>The 1956 popular song by <a title="George Melachrino" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Melachrino">George Melachrino</a>, <strong>Mrs. Santa Claus</strong>, and the 1963 children&#8217;s book <strong>How Mrs. Santa Claus Saved Christmas</strong>, by <a title="Phyllis McGinley" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phyllis_McGinley">Phyllis McGinley</a>, helped standardize and establish the character and role of <a title="Mrs. Claus" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mrs._Claus">Mrs Claus</a> in the popular imagination.</p></blockquote>
<p>Modern Santa is almost always presented in one way: as an old, fat white bearded man, although Billy Bob Thornton in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Santa"><strong>Bad Santa</strong></a> certainly gave us at least a refreshingly dishonest take on things. Mrs Santa comes in two, perhaps three distinct forms. The two key ones are old, fat white haired woman and the attractive, buxom younger model.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s also a rarer type. This one is neither young nor old, glamour model nor well-rounded jolly lady. You have to do a bit of digging, but she could almost be a normal woman (gasp!), albeit a bit mumsy. I am chosing to term this <strong>The Angela Lansbury Option</strong> for reasons that will become apparent (and awesome) later.</p>
<p>Hmmm.  Three different depictions across some rather familiar age ranges &#8211; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Goddess_%28Neopaganism%29">maiden, mother, crone</a> anyone? Although looking (if we must) at those cheeky<sup><a href="/2011/12/13/looking-for-mrs-santa-claus/#footnote_0_8998" id="identifier_0_8998" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" As an aside, I hate this use of word &ldquo;cheeky&rdquo;.

Anyway&hellip; ">1</a></sup>  Mrs Santa costumes, I&#8217;m less sure about whether advertisers had &#8220;maidens&#8221; in mind as opposed to &#8220;ho ho ho&#8221;.</p>
<h3>So, who are these Mrs Clauses and what are they doing?</h3>
<p>The original version is simply a female counterpart to Santa. She&#8217;s a &#8220;goodwife&#8221; and the grandmother to his grandfather role, where all the children of the world are their beloved grandkids &#8211; once a year, at least.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s good to see positive depictions of old women in circulation amidst all the other negative presentations of &#8220;wicked witches&#8221;. So far, so good, but how is she used in the media? Like her husband, she seems to be a vehicle for &#8220;sell, sell, sell&#8221; especially in <a href="http://smallbusinessadvertisingstrategies.com/christmas-advertising-ideas-5-christmas-advertising-ideas-for-small-businesses/">marketing for women</a>. She is, however, pretty much welded to the kitchen.</p>
<p>Over at <a href="http://www.northpole.com/kitchen/">northpole.com</a> and <a href="http://www.claus.com/kitchen/htmlkitchen.php">claus.com</a> you can find her making cakes in the kitchen. Not that I&#8217;m against women in kitchens (<a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/12/06/the-revolution-will-not-be-microwaved-modern-female-protest-at-home/">obviously not</a>), and those gingerbread men look tasty, but are there alternatives for festive octogenarian females?</p>
<p>Well, in <a href="http://www.hymnsandcarolsofchristmas.com/Poetry/Goody_Santa_Claus/goody_santa_claus.htm">her first appearance in Bates&#8217;s poem</a> &#8211; which is an interesting read in and of itself with its portrayal of the feminine sphere &#8211; we find her blagging her way onto hubby&#8217;s sleigh to mend the stockings of poor children so that they too can share the presents.</p>
<blockquote><p>But I&#8217;ll mend that sock so nearly it shall hold your gifts completely.<br />
Take the reins and let me show you what a woman&#8217;s wit can do.</p></blockquote>
<p>If we skip a few generations along, she gets even more awesome, and we find &#8220;Mrs North&#8221;, in the film <strong>Mrs. Santa Claus</strong>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mrs._Santa_Claus">crash landing in New York in 1910 and getting involved in the women&#8217;s suffrage movement.</a></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t knock the Angela Lansbury option, bitches.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sexy&#8221; Mrs Santas, meanwhile (and note how that automotically means young and beautiful), are sadly confined to selling a lot of ill-advised and probably itchy costumes, including some truly dreadful underwear.</p>
<p>My most strange discovery is that they are also allegedly <a href="http://www.comicvine.com/mrs-santa-claus/29-22192/">comic book heroes</a> &#8211; this one is especially odd, given that the main image on this webpage should be of the older version. (However, I&#8217;m not that surprised at the choice of image given much of the comic industry&#8217;s ongoing campaign these days to replace all women with fembot boobtastic sexed up versions of themselves.)</p>
<p>But to end on two positive notes, first up are five woman who I want to see as Mrs Santa Claus:</p>
<ul>
<li>Helen Mirren. Let&#8217;s try and get over this idea that older can&#8217;t be sexy, please?</li>
<li>Dawn French. She&#8217;d get the &#8220;jolly&#8221; vote, but she&#8217;s also pretty damn cool.</li>
<li>Dame Judi Dench. Bonus points if this occurs during the next Bond film. Extra bonus points if Daniel Craig takes his top off and a Christmas related joke is uttered. We deserve this following the Bond girl whose name was Christmas.</li>
<li>Tilda Swinton. I do not believe this needs any reason.</li>
<li>Margaret Thatcher. Oh come on. It would be hilarious, and the MOST IRONIC THING EVER.</li>
</ul>
<p>And finally, here&#8217;s a video of our newest, and perhaps most interestingly political heroine: Mrs Claus. Here she gives her opinion on the world and spreads a message of peace, tolerance, environmental activism and joy. Certainly an improvement on the Queen&#8217;s Speech in my opinion: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zjgU-DBU2w">Mrs Claus Speaks Up</a>.</p>
