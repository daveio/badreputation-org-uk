										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li><em><strong>Alyson Macdonald</strong>, who blogs for <a href="http://brightgreenscotland.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Bright Green</strong></a>, sent us this review. She&#8217;s previously written badass posts for us on the feminist issues in issue 1 of Kieron Gillen and Kamie McKelvie&#8217;s <a href="/2013/01/31/guest-post-young-avengers-1-sex-and-the-female-gaze/" target="_blank"><strong>Young Avengers</strong></a> and <a href="/2013/01/09/guest-post-found-feminism-rewatching-dirty-dancing/" target="_blank"><strong>Dirty Dancing</strong></a>. Do you have a guest post brewing in your brain? email us on <a href="mailto:badrepeditors@gmail.com">badrepeditors@gmail.com</a>.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Writer <a href="http://mattfraction.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Matt Fraction</strong></a> and artist <a href="http://zdarsky.tumblr.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Chip Zdarsky</strong></a> have created a warm and intelligent comic with an overtly pro-feminist take on sex and relationships. Don&#8217;t let the fact that it&#8217;s called <strong>Sex Criminals</strong> put you off – the title is a play on words and refers to the main characters&#8217; ability to literally stop time when they have sex, which they use to carry out bank robberies.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/sexcriminals1-cover.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="14092" data-permalink="/2013/09/30/guest-post-review-sex-criminals/sexcriminals1-cover/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/sexcriminals1-cover.jpg?fit=596%2C900&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="596,900" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="sexcriminals1-cover" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/sexcriminals1-cover.jpg?fit=198%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/sexcriminals1-cover.jpg?fit=596%2C900&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-14092 alignright" alt="Cover for Sex Criminals issue 1" src="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/sexcriminals1-cover.jpg?resize=271%2C409" width="271" height="409" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/sexcriminals1-cover.jpg?w=596&amp;ssl=1 596w, https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/sexcriminals1-cover.jpg?resize=198%2C300&amp;ssl=1 198w" sizes="(max-width: 271px) 100vw, 271px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a surreal concept, and one which is difficult to write well, but Fraction has built a successful career out of telling these kinds of stories, and is skilled in persuading readers to suspend their disbelief.</p>
<p>In <strong>Sex Criminals</strong>, time is not presented as strictly linear: events are shown out of sequence, and the adult version of the lead character Suzie narrates scenes from her adolescence, sometimes even appearing next to her younger self on the page. This time-travel effect makes it easier for the reader to accept Suzie&#8217;s time-stopping powers, while also establishing her as our link to the story.</p>
<p>By choosing a female lead character, writer Fraction is challenging popular culture&#8217;s tendency to shy away from female leads, as well as the relative taboo of women&#8217;s sexuality.</p>
<p>In particular, his willingness to discuss female masturbation is refreshing because, while male wanking is openly discussed, joked about, and accepted as a fact of life, there&#8217;s still a lingering sense that it&#8217;s dirty when women do it.</p>
<p>Early on in the comic, we see young Suzie discovering the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYzlVDlE72w" target="_blank">Greatest Love of All</a> in the bath, and it&#8217;s dealt with in a sensitive, not overtly-eroticised way &#8211; adult Suzie, narrating while fully clothed and perched on the edge of the bathtub, is the focus of the panel.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/SC1.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="14082" data-permalink="/2013/09/30/guest-post-review-sex-criminals/sc1/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/SC1.jpg?fit=802%2C352&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="802,352" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="SC1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/SC1.jpg?fit=300%2C131&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/SC1.jpg?fit=802%2C352&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-14082" alt="Panel from Sex Criminals 1. Suzie discusses her first orgasm." src="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/SC1.jpg?resize=578%2C254" width="578" height="254" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/SC1.jpg?w=802&amp;ssl=1 802w, https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/SC1.jpg?resize=300%2C131&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 578px) 100vw, 578px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Although we are aware that young Suzie is masturbating in this scene, the aim is not to sexualise her but to introduce her orgasm-related superpower, so the masturbation is less important than what happens immediately afterwards. In a pastiche of the old comics trope of an ordinary kid acquiring superpowers when they hit puberty, Suzie realises that time stops when she comes. Here, Fraction takes an inspired dig at the state of sex education in American schools, because Suzie has no idea whether her experience is normal, and she&#8217;s forced to rely on the dubious wisdom of a classmate when the adults won&#8217;t answer her questions.</p>
<p>Despite this, Suzie eventually becomes more confident about sex, and it&#8217;s made very clear to the reader that when she has sex with a partner it&#8217;s her choice to do so. As the narrator, she informs us that the first time she slept with her high school boyfriend Craig she had decided to do so in advance, and we see her enjoy the experience, even though it doesn&#8217;t live up to her expectation that it would be a profound, life-changing event. From a feminist point of view, the most interesting of the comic&#8217;s sex scenes is Suzie&#8217;s first encounter with Jon, who has just been introduced as the love interest. Jon explicitly checks for consent before initiating physical contact, in a way that seems natural, relaxed, and pretty damn sexy.</p>

<p>The admirable gender politics of the writing are perfectly complemented by Zdarsky&#8217;s art, which fits perfectly with a comic which is played for laughs as much as for titillation. It isn&#8217;t drawn in an overtly erotic style, and there isn&#8217;t as much nudity as you might expect. The fact that the art isn&#8217;t wank-bank material in and of itself highlights the more cerebral aspects of Suzie&#8217;s attraction to Jon; they fancy one another, but their interest is sparked by shared interests over looks.</p>
<p>The art is also key to conveying the comic&#8217;s humour, whether it&#8217;s in Craig&#8217;s ridiculous gurning expression when he&#8217;s frozen in time right at the point of orgasm, or the crude drawings of nonsensical sex acts that Rachelle uses to explain “the real raw sex shit” to teenage Suzie. There are also a range of less obvious visual gags worked into the art in backgrounds or on characters&#8217; clothes, including numerous references to a celebrity called “Sexual Gary” who appears to be a pin-up figure for teenage girls.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/SC4.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="14085" data-permalink="/2013/09/30/guest-post-review-sex-criminals/sc4/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/SC4.jpg?fit=722%2C364&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="722,364" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="SC4" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/SC4.jpg?fit=300%2C151&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/SC4.jpg?fit=722%2C364&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-14085" alt="Suzie discovers her orgasm has frozen time." src="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/SC4.jpg?resize=520%2C262" width="520" height="262" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/SC4.jpg?w=722&amp;ssl=1 722w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/SC4.jpg?resize=300%2C151&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Although <strong>Sex Criminals</strong> is a very funny comic, it also has emotional depth. The scenes from Suzie&#8217;s adolescence aren&#8217;t solely about her sexual development, but also deal with her father&#8217;s sudden death and her mother&#8217;s difficulty in coping afterwards. Young Suzie&#8217;s reactions are balanced by the narration from her adult self, creating a richer and more satisfying narrative.</p>
<p>Sex comedies can often disappoint feminists, but <strong>Sex Criminals</strong> shows that writers don&#8217;t have to rely on tired sexist stereotypes when writing jokes about sex, and that decent gender politics don&#8217;t have to be po-faced and humourless. Whether you&#8217;re a devoted comics fan or simply curious, this one is definitely worth a look.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Guest blogger Alyson Macdonald on why Gillen and McKelvie's Young Avengers is your new superhero comic to watch. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li><em><strong>Alyson Macdonald</strong>, who blogs for <a href="http://brightgreenscotland.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Bright Green</strong></a>, sent us this post. Do you have a guest post brewing in your brain? You know the drill: email us on <a href="mailto:badrepeditors@gmail.com">badrepeditors@gmail.com</a>.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Last week&#8217;s long-awaited, big-release comic was Kieron Gillen and Jamie McKelvie&#8217;s <strong>Young Avengers #1</strong>, a classic coming-of-age story about a group of 18-year-olds who just happen to be superheroes.</p>
<p>While many mainstream comics are still producing the kind of material that gets sent up on <a href="http://eschergirls.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Escher Girls</a> and <a href="http://thehawkeyeinitiative.com/" target="_blank">The Hawkeye Initiative</a>, Gillen and McKelvie actively reject the kind of objectification that gives the genre such a bad reputation amongst feminists. In contrast to the stereotypical tits-and-ass fare, the opening sequence of <strong>Young Avengers</strong> provides the reader with a three-page essay on the (straight/bi) female gaze. In a medium that overwhelmingly caters for straight male desires, this is a rare demonstration of how to do a sexy scene with decent gender politics.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2013/01/31/guest-post-young-avengers-1-sex-and-the-female-gaze/ya1/" rel="attachment wp-att-13060"><img data-attachment-id="13060" data-permalink="/2013/01/31/guest-post-young-avengers-1-sex-and-the-female-gaze/ya1/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/YA1.jpg?fit=1073%2C1665&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1073,1665" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="YA1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/YA1.jpg?fit=193%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/YA1.jpg?fit=659%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-13060 aligncenter" alt="YA1" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/YA1.jpg?resize=580%2C899" width="580" height="899" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/YA1.jpg?w=1073&amp;ssl=1 1073w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/YA1.jpg?resize=193%2C300&amp;ssl=1 193w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>On page one, Kate Bishop wakes up in an unfamiliar bed, having just hooked up with a man whose name she can&#8217;t quite remember. At this point anyone who&#8217;s familiar with comics, or popular culture in general, would expect to see some slut-shaming, or at least some titillating semi-nudity, but we get neither. Kate is dressed in a t-shirt which comes down to her mid-thigh, and it&#8217;s clear that she has no regrets, thinking: <em>For a second, some part of me thinks, “I should be ashamed.” I think that part of me is really stupid. </em></p>
<p>In the fourth panel we even see Kate smiling as she thinks back to the earlier part of her evening, and it&#8217;s the smile of someone who has just got laid and is pretty damned pleased with herself.<br />
The second page introduces us to Noh-Varr, whose bed Kate has woken up in, and this is where we see another convention subverted, because he&#8217;s the one in nothing but his underwear. In an interview with <a href="http://www.comicsalliance.com/2013/01/23/young-avengers-interview-kieron-gillen-jamie-mckelvie/#ixzz2IodBaUVn" target="_blank">Comics Alliance</a>, artist Jamie McKelvie explains the idea behind this scene:</p>
<blockquote><p>We&#8217;ve long had a problem in comics where the women are &#8220;sexy&#8221; (in a sexist fashion) and the men aren&#8217;t. Time to redress the balance. And there&#8217;s a big difference between sexist and sexy.</p></blockquote>

<p>Although male superheroes are usually drawn with extremely muscular physiques, it&#8217;s not normally sexualised in this way – the reader is supposed to want to <em>be</em> them, not have sex with them. This is a rare acknowledgement that people who fancy men read superhero comics too.</p>
<p>But rather than providing equality of objectification, the aim here is to have a sexy scene which enhances the story and doesn&#8217;t devalue either of the characters. If you&#8217;re enjoying the view of Noh-Varr in his underwear, it&#8217;s just a bonus, not the entire point of the sequence; if you&#8217;re not into it, his lack of clothes is incidental. As Gillen puts it in <a href="http://kierongillen.tumblr.com/post/40045596084/meet-the-team-marvel-boy" target="_blank">an introduction to the character of Noh-Varr</a> on his Tumblr:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;characters being sexy is cool but objectification in the process is bullshit. An inability to see the difference is a fundamental weakness. My wife’s in the next room watching Lord of the Rings, and I guarantee she’s thinking sexy thoughts about Aragorn. But that works without anything which annihilates him as a character, y’know?</p></blockquote>
<p>The reader is supposed to see this scene through Kate&#8217;s eyes, and as she watches Noh-Varr dancing around in his pants, it acknowledges the existence of the female gaze, both through Kate&#8217;s interest in watching him, and the <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice" target="_blank">fanservice</a> of the artwork.</p>
<p>Noh-Varr has a masculine appearance, but – perhaps because he&#8217;s an alien from another dimension – he doesn&#8217;t appear to be burdened with ideas of conventional masculinity, as we can see from his music choices. The comic&#8217;s title page states that the record he puts on is &#8216;Be My Baby&#8217; by the Ronettes (incidentally, this is the track played over the opening titles of the film <strong>Dirty Dancing</strong>, which is also about <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2013/01/09/guest-post-found-feminism-rewatching-dirty-dancing/">female sexual awakening</a>), and he talks about his enthusiasm for “close harmony girl groups” in a way that a heterosexual Earth man probably wouldn&#8217;t, because he&#8217;d be afraid of seeming effeminate. The play on gender roles is, of course, entirely deliberate, as one of the major influences in this version of the character is David Bowie during his androgynous, bisexual-identifying period in the early 1970s.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2013/01/31/guest-post-young-avengers-1-sex-and-the-female-gaze/ya3/" rel="attachment wp-att-13062"><img data-attachment-id="13062" data-permalink="/2013/01/31/guest-post-young-avengers-1-sex-and-the-female-gaze/ya3/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/YA3.jpg?fit=1043%2C1067&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1043,1067" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="YA3" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/YA3.jpg?fit=293%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/YA3.jpg?fit=1000%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-13062" alt="YA3" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/YA3.jpg?resize=526%2C538" width="526" height="538" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/YA3.jpg?w=1043&amp;ssl=1 1043w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/YA3.jpg?resize=293%2C300&amp;ssl=1 293w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/YA3.jpg?resize=1000%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 526px) 100vw, 526px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>As Kate watches Noh-Varr, the scene is interrupted by a Skrull attack (Skrulls are a species of warrior aliens that occasionally pop up in the Marvel Universe to attack either Earth or Noh-Varr&#8217;s species of warrior aliens). If this was a horror movie, this would be the moment where Kate&#8217;s decision to go back to Noh-Varr&#8217;s place for sexytimes gets her killed in a disgustingly graphic way, but rather than being punished for her naughty behaviour, Kate is rewarded with another adventure, when she pilots the space ship.</p>
<p>As well as understanding what many female fans want to see, Gillen also accepts that sometimes our appreciation goes beyond what&#8217;s on the page:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ever since our work on <a href="http://www.phonogramcomic.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Phonogram</strong></a>, Jamie have [sic] strove to make our comics – for want of a better phrase – <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_fiction" target="_blank">slash-fic</a>-able. If you’re working in certain heroic fantasy genres, that’s part of the emotional churn.</p>
<p>(taken from Gillen&#8217;s <a href="http://kierongillen.tumblr.com/post/40045596084/meet-the-team-marvel-boy" target="_blank">tumblr post on Noh-Varr</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>Recent comic book adaptation movies like <strong>Avengers Assemble</strong> and <strong>X-Men:First Class</strong> have been gleefully adopted by fanfiction writers, who find that the gender imbalances and close friendships between male characters give them plenty of material to work with. While slash has sometimes been treated as fandom&#8217;s dirty secret, Gillen and McKelvie are obviously quite comfortable with it. The title page even provides a nod to fangirl culture by adopting their language: editors Jake Thomas and Lauren Sankovitch are credited with “LOLs” and “feels” respectively – that&#8217;s “humour” and “emotions” to anyone who isn&#8217;t up-to-date on their internet memes.</p>
<p><strong>Young Avengers</strong> clearly demonstrates something which I&#8217;ve long suspected to be true: it really is possible for male writers to “get” female fans. Although there are female comics creators producing work that doesn&#8217;t make women cringe – even with big publishers like Marvel and DC – it doesn&#8217;t mean that their male colleagues should have a free pass to be obnoxiously sexist. We should be holding more men to the pro-feminist standard that Gillen and McKelvie have set, not just in comics, but in all forms of pop culture.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following on from Miranda&#8217;s  illustrator-themed posts a while back (<a title="Illustration Interlude" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/02/02/illustration-interlude/">here</a> and <a title="Another Illustration Interlude" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/02/14/another-illustration-interlude/">here</a>) I thought I&#8217;d send a few more graphical delights your way.</p>
<p>I say &#8216;feminist&#8217; up there, I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;s how all these artists would define themselves, but if you are a feminist or even have an interest in gender I think you may find a lot to love in their work. To be honest I&#8217;m not even sure they&#8217;d all call themselves cartoonists either&#8230; You may well have heard of them before, but if not, you&#8217;re in for a treat.</p>

<p>I picked up <strong><a title="Fantagraphics - I Love Led Zeppelin" href="http://www.fantagraphics.com/browse-shop/i-love-led-zeppelin-5.html?vmcchk=1" target="_blank">I Love Led Zeppelin</a></strong> after Forney was mentioned in Trina Robbins&#8217; fantastic book <strong><a title="From Girls to Grrrlz" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/From-Girls-Grrrlz-Trina-Robbins/dp/0811821994/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1340993055&amp;sr=1-2" target="_blank">From Girls to Grrrlz</a></strong>. It would have been worth it just for the fantastic &#8216;how to&#8217; series, which include: how to re-attach an amputated finger, how to dominate someone, how to talk to your kids about drugs. But there&#8217;s lots of good stuff here (especially if you like your stuff on the queer side) and I love Forney&#8217;s warm, clear lines.</p>

<h3>4)<a title="Dame Darcy" href="http://www.damedarcy.com/" target="_blank"> Dame Darcy</a></h3>
<p>Artist, doll-maker, banjo-player, part-time mermaid&#8230; Dame Darcy is morbid and fabulous just like her comic <strong><a title="Fantagraphics - Meat Cake" href="http://www.fantagraphics.com/index.php?keyword=meat+cake&amp;Search=Search&amp;Itemid=62&amp;option=com_virtuemart&amp;page=shop.browse" target="_blank">Meat Cake</a></strong>, which largely defies description. A bizarre and chaotic mix of Victoriana, fairytales, gothic and goth, <strong>Meat Cake</strong> has a cast of equally strange characters which include a smooth-talking wolf, a superbitch mermaid, and the tragic undead Strega Pez who can communicate only through messages delivered on Pez-like tablets from her slashed throat. Makes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloomcookie"><strong>Gloom Cookie</strong></a> look like <strong>The Archers</strong>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the first Friday Linkpost of 2012!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.jimchines.com/2012/01/striking-a-pose/">Author Jim C Hines tries out some female poses from fantasy fiction cover art</a></strong> &#8211; and discovers that bodies don&#8217;t work like that.</li>
<li>Which doesn&#8217;t surprise anyone, because <strong>Ils</strong> at <strong>Justsayins</strong> is a martial-artist AND contortionist, and <a href="http://justsayins.tumblr.com/post/14957660366/this-needs-to-stop-and-let-me-tell-you-why"><strong>she can&#8217;t do the poses either</strong></a>. (Her reply post is <a href="http://justsayins.tumblr.com/post/15063906958/its-funny">well worth reading too</a>.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some follow-up links to previous items now, as <strong>Lego</strong>&#8216;s disastrous decision to make <A href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/lego-is-for-girls-12142011.html">pastel-themed and differently-sized Lego just for girls</a> has brought out a whole load of customisation from people who want to give them back an adventuring, building, exciting Lego experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>This <a href="http://superpunch.blogspot.com/2012/01/more-fun-with-lego-for-girls.html"><strong>Badass Retro Aviator</strong></a> by <strong>Nathaniel Brill</strong> made us very happy!</li>
<li>And <a href="http://margotmagowan.wordpress.com/2012/01/04/letter-from-14-yr-old-girl-to-lego/" /><strong>AWESOME 14 year-old Ann Garth</strong></a> wrote to Lego to complain.</li>
<li>We also posted before on <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/09/27/found-feminism-my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic/">the Brony phenomenon</a>, where guys of all ages are becoming fans of <strong>My Little Pony &#8211; Friendship is Magic</strong>, and now <strong>Jonny Sims <a href="http://jonnysopiumden.wordpress.com/2011/12/21/bronies/">suspects he&#8217;s cracked exactly why it&#8217;s happening&#8230;</a></strong></li>
<li>And finally, <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fat-Ladies-Spaaaaace-body-positive-coloring/dp/1463786832">Fat Ladies In Spaaaaace!</strong></a> is the title of a children&#8217;s colouring-book, showing &#8220;<em>Eighteen fat sci-fi heroines doing what they do best: trekking across the time and space, blasting off into adventure, and saving the day.</em>&#8220;</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s a bunch of geeky, fandom and feminism-relevent things I&#8217;ve been enjoying lately. We&#8217;re hoping to turn this into a regular feature, and our ed, Miranda, has called it <strong>Awesomewatch</strong>, presumably knowing of my love of watching Chris Packham and team harass the nation&#8217;s wildlife every week on <strong>Autumnwatch</strong>&#8230;<sup><a href="/2011/10/20/awesomewatch-or-things-which-are-awesome-right-now-by-jenni-aged-24-34/#footnote_0_7829" id="identifier_0_7829" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" Ed: &ldquo;I may not have been entirely sober when I thought of this, but it&rsquo;s too late now, we&rsquo;re GOING WITH IT.&rdquo; ">1</a></sup></p>

<h2>Game: Mass Effect</h2>
<p>About a hundred years behind the rest of the entire internet, I&#8217;m playing<strong> Mass Effect 2</strong>, and I&#8217;m enjoying it so, so much. I want to book a week off work just to complete it, and game all day long.</p>
<p>You play Commander Shepard, who can be a man or woman, and it&#8217;s amazingly refreshing to be able to play a female war hero (either way, you&#8217;re pretty famous, after saving the galaxy in <strong>Mass Effect 1</strong>). It&#8217;s great to be able to play this female character who inspires so much respect in her colleagues, military and civilian &#8211; everywhere she goes, even big scary warlike aliens are afraid of her. My Shepard&#8217;s a not-very-physically-intimidating blonde, so it&#8217;s kind of fun.</p>
<p>I love the team-building aspects of the game, too. You have to persuade people to join you, and keep them happy and loyal throughout the game. You can play as a good guy or a bad guy, and some of the choices the game gives you (allow genocide to continue for the good of the galaxy?) are brilliant to play through. As writer and fellow Garrus fangirl <a href="http://sennydreadful.com/">Jennifer Williams</a> said in <a href="http://sennydreadful.com/3-reasons-why-mass-effect-is-the-greatest-of">her review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bioware seem to specialise in making the sort of games where you have to put the controller down for a bit and have a really good think about the consequences of your actions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Several <a href="http://geekfeminism.org/2011/06/21/quick-hit-shepard-ain%E2%80%99t-white-playing-with-race-and-gender-in-mass-effect/">articles</a> have been written on how feminist-friendly the game can be, some <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/05/16/gamer-diary-rpg-advertising-women/">on this blog</a>, so I won&#8217;t go into too much detail here except to add my name to the many reviewers recommending it. Even if you don&#8217;t play many games, you should try this one. I&#8217;m running it on my laptop; you can <a href="http://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri/">check here</a> whether you can run it on your computer&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Mass Effect 3</strong>, out next summer, looks like it&#8217;ll be even better. They&#8217;re promising to use a female Shepard in the marketing drive, and although there were lesbian options<sup><a href="/2011/10/20/awesomewatch-or-things-which-are-awesome-right-now-by-jenni-aged-24-34/#footnote_1_7829" id="identifier_1_7829" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" I was going to let my Shepard have a lesbian romance, but, well, the Tank Girl lookalike on my team is straight as a very straight thing, and Space Batman alien Garrus has caught my eye. He was on Shepard&rsquo;s team in Mass Effect 1, and their dialogue&rsquo;s adorable in a kind of equals-and-comrades-under-fire kind of way. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one in the galaxy I respect more than you, Shepard.&rdquo; Bless. ">2</a></sup> available for Shepard to romance in <strong>Mass Effect 1</strong> and <strong>2</strong>, in <strong>3</strong> male Shepard will be able to romance some of the guys, too. I&#8217;m not sure why these things weren&#8217;t done before, but I feel like Bioware is at least a company that listens to what its fans want. I&#8217;ll be checking out their <strong>Dragon Age II</strong> next (another game highly recommended by geeks and feminists!) while I wait impatiently for <strong>ME3</strong>&#8230;</p>

<p>As much as many DC52 comics have been a disappointment, (Harley Quinn <a href="http://www.comicsalliance.com/2011/06/20/dc-relaunch-costume-roundtable-fashion/">loses half her costume</a>! Catwoman wants to show you ALL HER BRAS. <a href="http://www.comicsalliance.com/2011/09/22/starfire-catwoman-sex-superheroine/">ALL OF THEM</a>. Amanda Waller <a href="http://www.comicsalliance.com/2011/09/14/amanda-waller-skinny-thin-reboot/">becomes skinny</a>! Disabled character Oracle <a href="http://www.comicsalliance.com/2011/06/06/batgirl-barbara-gordon-disabled/">walks</a>, becomes Batgirl! DC comics manage to become <em>even less</em> diverse!) I still have to say, this one looks promising.</p>
<p><strong>Demon Knights</strong> is set in the Middle Ages, and Paul cites <strong>Dragon Age II</strong> and &#8216;the medieval Magnificent Seven&#8217; as points of inspiration. Much like my old favourite <strong>Secret Six</strong>, (sadly, sadly, <em>outrageously</em> cancelled for the DC52,)  it seems as though it will star protagonists who range from reluctant antiheroes who&#8217;d rather be at the pub, to absolute bastards who are just along for the fun of it, saving the day and arguing and falling in and out of bed with each other while they do it. My favourite kind of heroes.</p>
<p>Promisingly for the fans of this blog, it also looks as though not only will four of the seven &#8216;knights&#8217; be of the female persuasion, but the main baddie, the Questing Queen, is also very much a lady.</p>
<p>Well, I say four ladies&#8230; Sir Ystin, a knight <a href="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.comicsalliance.com/media/2011/09/shiningknight.jpg">who self-introduces as &#8216;sir&#8217;</a>, may turn out to be more nuanced than that. Earlier versions of the character, the Shining Knight, have been both a cissexual man, and a young girl disguised as a man in pursuit of her true love, Sir Gawain, but neither of those seem to fit here. Hints dropped by Paul, and Ystin&#8217;s insistence on the title &#8216;sir&#8217; in this volume, however, despite the other characters&#8217; doubt, makes me wonder whether we&#8217;re actually seeing the first gender variant character of the DC52&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to judge an entirely new comic on just twenty pages, but this issue made me laugh, and made me want to know a lot more about all seven of the main characters, which is pretty much what I want in a first issue.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also extremely quotable:</p>
<blockquote><p>We find the source of the problem, and we throw dragons at it.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;m enjoying the way they&#8217;ve named it after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Sue">Mary Sues</a>, as well.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Team BadRep were put on the spot again this month: in the wake of <a href="http://dcwomenkickingass.tumblr.com/post/7985599811/panels">SDCC Batgirl</a> igniting the gender-and-comics conversation loud &#8216;n&#8217; proud, the team were asked to take a look at their favourite comic book titles and characters &#8211; some obvious choices, some less so&#8230; and here&#8217;s Rob.<br />
</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“Everyone knows my story. I get dressed up. The clock strikes twelve. I lose a shoe. And it’s all downhill from there. My name is Cinderella, Cindy to my friends. Don’t tell anyone, but I’m a spy. One of the best, even if I’m being humble. And there are times I love my job.” </p>
<p>&#8211; Cinderella, From Fabletown with Love</p></blockquote>
<p>Swapping the genders of characters around to put female characters in the roles usually filled by men and vice versa isn’t anything shockingly new. But that doesn’t make it any less cool when someone goes and does it well. Which, arguably, is exactly what <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Cinderella_(Fables)"><strong>Cinderella</strong></a> (in her spin-off miniseries from the <strong>Fables </strong> universe) does. (Note: this recommendation is based on the first volume of her tales, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinderella:_From_Fabletown_With_Love"><strong>From Fabletown With Love</strong></a>. I haven’t read the second arc yet, <strong>Fables Are Forever</strong>.)</p>
<p>Cinderella, as far as most of her fellow Fables know, is an empty-headed fashionista, owner of the local shoe shop, and one of Prince Charming’s ex-wives. What most of them don’t know is that she’s also a master spy and sometimes assassin, their very own James Bond. Only better.</p>
<p>We open with Cinderella punching out a gun-toting mook, diving off Big Ben’s clock tower, and hang-gliding out over London. It’s one hell of an introduction and far from the most kickass moment she gets in the book. Along the way, she also finds time to kick the ever-loving crap out of some shapeshifting monsters, storm an oil rig, deal with armed assassins and overthrow an evil regime with a well-thrown clog.</p>
<p>So her badass credentials are certainly up to spec for the super-spy genre, but what else? Well, it wouldn’t be a spy story without a Bond girl. That role here is ably filled by Aladdin, Cinderella’s intelligence-gathering counterpart from the Baghdad Fable community. True to form he’s capable and effective but not quite up to Cinderella’s level and practically carries a glowing neon sign reading “capture and imprison me so I can be daringly rescued!”.</p>
<p>There are two particularly nice little points in the interaction between Cinderella and Aladdin. First up, the hook-up that’s pretty much inevitable with the genre. When it does happen, Cinderella is very definitely the active party in deciding when and initiating things. There was the risk that we’d see that whole scene take a more traditional approach, which would have entirely undermined the character, but fortunately she remains entirely herself and entirely in charge.</p>
<p>The other nice moment is the ideological exchange between them, shortly after they get done kicking monsters in the jaw for the first time. The conversation comes round to Islam and, honestly, it’s handled pretty fairly. It’s only one page worth of stuff, but writer Chris Roberson deals with it well. It’s certainly a nice change from the slightly cringe-inducing pro-Israel speech Bill Willingham included in the main Fables series.</p>
<p>The art is pretty solid too. At no point, as far as I can tell, does Cinderella adopt <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/04/13/found-feminism-tomorrow-when-the-war-began-film-poster-on-the-london-underground/">that terrible spine-breaker pose</a> so commonly inflicted on comic book women. The outfits are sensible too, with the daring infiltration of an old oil platform taking place in appropriate combat gear and her regular wear never getting any more risqué than an evening dress. (Well, one of the covers does feature a wetsuit with an inexplicable cleavage window. Cleavage windows aside, Chrissie Zullo’s work on the covers is gorgeous.)</p>

Art by Chrissie Zullo." width="193" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-6773" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/023-cinderella-from-fabletown-with-love-3-chrissie-zullo.jpg?w=193&amp;ssl=1 193w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/023-cinderella-from-fabletown-with-love-3-chrissie-zullo.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w" sizes="(max-width: 193px) 100vw, 193px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-6773" class="wp-caption-text">How does that wetsuit even work with a hole in it?</p></div>
<p>So that’s Cinderella, Fabletown’s very own badass super-spy. Hopefully she&#8217;s just as fantastic in her second story arc. Oh, and she comes from good company too, with others like <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Rose_Red">Rose Red</a>, <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Snow_White">Snow White</a>, and <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Frau_Totenkinder">Frau Totenkinder</a> rocking along in the main series. Frau Totenkinder in particular is worthy of mention, since it’s nice to see a much older female character who’s still awesome.</p>

<p>Ah, comics. Or <em>graphic novels</em>, if they are trying to seduce me across a pseudy coffee bar in Edinburgh, which they did &#8211; more on that later.</p>
<p>Dear reader, this is a tale of a long, passionate, but fractious love affair.</p>
<p>It started early. I noticed them, but they never seemed to be the right one for me, stocked as they were in the &#8220;boys&#8217; section&#8221; of the magazine racks. I kept myself busy with the garish colours of the (probably) gender neutral <a href="http://www.dandy.com/"><strong>Dandy</strong></a> and the <a href="http://www.beano.com/"><strong>Beano</strong></a>. Whilst being amused but ultimately concerned by the levels of naughtiness from <a href="http://www.beano.com/characters/minnie-the-minx">Minnie the Minx</a> (I was a very conscientious child), I found myself captured by a few sections from the pages of hand-me-down copies of the now-defunct &#8220;girls&#8217; own&#8221; annual <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunty"><strong>Bunty</strong></a>. Looking back on it, the artwork was poor and the storylines were hammy with a sprinkling of schmaltz, but some stood out: tales of mystery, adventure, aliens and heroines were hidden amidst the pages of dreary &#8220;girl stuff&#8221;. Now we&#8217;re talking!</p>

<p>Flash forward, and I&#8217;m at university in Edinburgh with actual money in my pocket. I&#8217;ve caught flickers of images in such hallowed sanctuaries as <a href="http://forbiddenplanet.com/">Forbidden Planet</a>, which is exciting but mostly full of plastic models. <a href="http://www.deadheadcomics.co.uk/">Deadhead</a>, lurking on the crooked medieval road across from the pub where I&#8217;ve just earned my actual money, is poky and rammed with paper; pleasingly reminiscment in layout and smell of old bookshops.</p>
<p>On the shelves I spot a beautifully painted (thank you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_Fegredo">Duncan Fegredo</a>) issue of Mike Carey&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer_%28DC_Comics%29"><strong>Lucifer</strong></a>, where a winged schoolgirl escapes the giant maw of a fiery demon; the first of the new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catwoman"><strong>Catwoman</strong></a> where Selina Kyle is resplendent and powerful in a jumpsuit and combat boots; and the gothic lusciousness of Serena Valentino&#8217;s  <a href="http://serenavalentino.com/gloomcookie/"><strong>GloomCookie</strong></a>. <em>And that was just the covers!</em></p>

<p>The stories, oh, oh, oh the stories. Magical, fantastical, intricate and complex tales of all kinds with interesting and varied female characters being just as magical, just as fantastically intricate and complex as their male counterparts.</p>
<p>I am doing my level best to just not list all of them because that would be a little tedious &#8211; check the Wiki articles or better yet come round and read them &#8211; my point is that they were there, and they were<em> so far</em> removed from any other female heroes (or anti-heroes, or villains) that I had ever seen before, and there were just SO MANY of them.</p>
<p>Over the next many years I spent a lot of time and money on comics. I was in love.  Besotted. I compulsively collected every issue of the jaw-dropping <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fables_%28comics%29"><strong>Fables</strong></a> and <a href="http://www.dccomics.com/vertigo/graphic_novels/?gn=1736"><strong>Y: The Last Man</strong></a> (a must for any comic collection). As I tend to be when in love, I was somewhat obsessed. I wrote my dissertation on postmodernist structuralism in Grant Morrison&#8217;s <a href="http://www.barbelith.com/bomb/"><strong>The Invisibles</strong></a> (I know better now, it should have been postmodern superhero archetypes in <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Doom_Patrol:_Crawling_from_the_Wreckage"><strong>Doom Patrol</strong></a>).</p>
<p>I found the most perfect fairy tale ever told in the form of Jeff Smith&#8217;s independent offering <a href="http://www.boneville.com/"><strong>Bone</strong></a>. This is an epic adventure of derring do, lost princesses who need to save the kingdom, war, friendship, quiche and dragons. I cannot recommend it enough.<br />

<p>The character of Grandma Ben blasts away so many female stereotypes. She is mysterious, strong, forthright, takes no nonsense and just plain funny.  She also races cows. As in, races against them. I aim to also do this when I am her age (which she refuses to tell anyone, of course).</p>
<p>But as I read my way through everything that caught my eye, I was spotting a change.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Transmetropolitan_characters#Yelena_Rossini">Filthy Assistant number two</a> Yelena Rossini romped her way through Warren Ellis&#8217; <strong>Transmetropolitan</strong> and stole my heart somewhat with her hard smoking, futuristic gumshoe gonzo journalism and attack womb. Zee Hernandez from Brian Wood&#8217;s spectacular <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMZ_%28comics%29"><strong>DMZ</strong></a> played Beatrice to the lost photographer and guided both him and the reader through a ghastly vision of New York as the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>These women were still good, still interesting, but they were second fiddle, playing traditional (albeit revamped and turbo-boosted) support roles such as healers and helpmeets whilst also filling the &#8220;minority quota&#8221;, especially in the case of Zee who is both non-white and non-male. Naturally all of them end up sleeping with or as love interests for the male protagonists, although at least the storylines of those titles made up for the stereotypes.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the way, it started to go wrong. Bit by bit by bit, even these characters faded away. The series that I loved ended (I cried at the end of <strong>Lucifer</strong>) and were replaced with weaker, less interesting versions. Costumes became smaller, boobs bigger. I started my &#8220;never buy a comic where the cover art has a woman with breasts bigger than her head&#8221; campaign, and found myself wealthier but with a<em> lot less</em> comics.</p>
<p>Female characters and their stories became less widely available. There were still some bright sparks but these were increasingly ghettoised in the narrow &#8220;independent&#8221; section of the store or as part of autobiographical works such as the excellent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persepolis_%28comics%29"><strong>Persepolis</strong></a>. The lack of new work meant that shops began pushing long-standing books like <a href="http://www.strangersinparadise.com/"><strong>Strangers in Paradise</strong></a> or reprints of classics  obviously aimed at women such as <a href="http://dykestowatchoutfor.com/"><strong>Dykes to Watch Out For</strong></a>.</p>
<p>There were still good stories in comic book world, with great artwork, but the women I had come to love had gone missing from the mainstream. Titles such as <strong>Wonder Woman</strong> or <strong>Lady Death</strong> looked like bad pornography, and the artwork for some of my favourite writers became downright ridiculous to the point of offensive. My relationship with comics was getting rocky.</p>
<p>I can pinpoint the exact moment that caused us to break up. It was <a href="http://www.ignitioncity.com/"><strong>Ignition City</strong></a> by Warren Ellis, specifically the way that almost every page had a massive pair of tits or tight (female) bottom in it, regardless of whether that was particularly appropriate or relevant. The male characters, of course, could be as fat, wrinkly, gross, old, multicultural and multidimensional as actual people. The female characters only existed to ensure that there were toned body parts for the consumption of the reader (who obviously wasn&#8217;t meant to be me).</p>
<p>What happened to my love?  What changed? I don&#8217;t know. I have moved to pastures new &#8211; online comics such as <a href="http://www.freakangels.com/"><strong>Freak Angels</strong></a>, <a href="http://www.girlgeniusonline.com/"><strong>Girl Genius</strong></a>, <a href="http://www.sinfest.net/"><strong>Sinfest</strong></a> and <a href="http://xkcd.com/"><strong>XKCD</strong></a> fulfill my panel-related addiction, but every now and then I look longingly at my groaning bookshelf with all those beautiful trade paperbacks, wondering when, if ever, there might be a return to form.</p>
<p>Come back, baby. I miss you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No doubt most of you will have heard of <a title="Kickstarter" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, the crowdfunding platform for creative projects. If this were a newspaper the headline would probably be &#8220;Move over boys&#8221; or &#8220;The feminists are coming&#8221; or something like that because I&#8217;m going to point out that there are some feminists using it.</p>
<h3>Kickstarter</h3>
<p>I like Kickstarter because of its pleasing by-the-people-for-the-people ethos and the fact it gives independent filmmakers, writers, musicians and artists a chance to make their ideas a reality. It&#8217;s all very &#8216;open&#8217; as they say. In fact <a href="http://opensource.com/business/10/1/giving-creative-projects-community-kickstart">Open Source blog</a> says this:</p>
<blockquote><p>The beauty of Kickstarter is that it bypasses the traditional channels artists would need to navigate in order to fund a project. Here funding depends on community participation rather than closed-door gatekeepers. The individual investments can be small and spread among those who care about that project’s success.</p></blockquote>
<p>What we have here of course is also a fantastic opportunity for political or minority groups to get unpopular projects off the ground, projects that would never be able to attract funding from traditional investors (who tend to be of the wealthy white male variety) because they can&#8217;t see the &#8216;market&#8217; for them.</p>
<h3>Some awesome feminist projects</h3>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Womanthology-Cover-Big.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="6484" data-permalink="/2011/07/18/crowdfunding-feminism/womanthology-cover-big/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Womanthology-Cover-Big.jpg?fit=400%2C314&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="400,314" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Womanthology-Cover" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Womanthology-Cover-Big.jpg?fit=300%2C235&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Womanthology-Cover-Big.jpg?fit=400%2C314&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6484" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Womanthology-Cover-Big-300x235.jpg?resize=300%2C235" alt="Womanthology cover art" width="300" height="235" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Womanthology-Cover-Big.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Womanthology-Cover-Big.jpg?w=382&amp;ssl=1 382w, https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Womanthology-Cover-Big.jpg?w=400&amp;ssl=1 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Have a search on Kickstarter and you&#8217;ll find all kinds of socially conscientious and community projects about race, sexuality, disability, class and yes: gender. In fact Ms Magazine in the US have started a regular <a title="Ms Feminist Booster Club" href="http://msmagazine.com/blog/blog/2011/07/07/feminist-booster-club-help-a-native-filmmaker-finish-her-doc-on-ladonna-harris/" target="_blank">Feminist Booster Club</a> feature on their blog to spotlight different feminist projects deserving of support.</p>
<p>And it works. One example is the fantabulous <a title="Kickstarter - Womanthology" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/renaedeliz/womanthology-massive-all-female-comic-anthology" target="_blank">Womanthology</a> project which has managed to fully fund itself in a matter of weeks:</p>
<blockquote><p>Womanthology is a large scale anthology comic showcasing the works of women in comics. It is created entirely by over 140 women of all experience levels&#8230; The purpose of the book is to show support for female creators in comics and media. There will be multiple short stories, how to&#8217;s &amp; interviews with professionals, and features showcasing iconic female comic creators that have passed, such as Nell Brinkley and Tarpe Mills. A Kids &amp; Teens section will also be included, showcasing their work, and offering tips &amp; tricks to help them prepare themselves for their future careers in comics.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/portfolio-face-sm.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="6485" data-permalink="/2011/07/18/crowdfunding-feminism/portfolio-face-sm/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/portfolio-face-sm.jpg?fit=447%2C246&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="447,246" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Illusionists face" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/portfolio-face-sm.jpg?fit=300%2C165&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/portfolio-face-sm.jpg?fit=447%2C246&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6485" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/portfolio-face-sm-300x165.jpg?resize=300%2C165" alt="Face with criticism (&quot;My eyelid is droopy&quot;) taken from women's magazine" width="300" height="165" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/portfolio-face-sm.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/portfolio-face-sm.jpg?w=447&amp;ssl=1 447w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Of course it helps that the project has the support and involvement of a number of big names (for geeks anyway) such as Gail Simone, Bonnie Burton and Neil Gaiman. But still: awesome.</p>
<p>A project I&#8217;d been following for a long time before it was at the Kickstarter stage is <a title="Kickstarter - The Illusionists" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1085595579/the-illusionists-documentary-insecurity-sells" target="_blank">The Illusionists</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Illusionists is a feature-length documentary about the commodification of the body and the marketing of unattainable beauty around the world.</p>
<p>The film will explore the influence that corporations have on our perceptions of ourselves, showing how mass media, advertising and several industries manipulate people&#8217;s insecurities about their bodies for profit.</p></blockquote>
<p>Having followed its development over the last couple of years I think its going to be a corker. And it&#8217;s not quite at its funding target yet, so you know&#8230; *cough* stump up! *cough*</p>
<h3>Microloans for women in the developing world</h3>
<p>The idea of crowdfunding has taken off in a big way over the last couple of years, and it&#8217;s often linked to the microfinance initiative in development, particularly in relation to empowering women.</p>
<p>There is something quite thrilling about using <a title="Kiva" href="http://www.kiva.org/" target="_blank">Kiva</a> or another platform to give funding directly to a woman in Kenya or Nepal to help her start a business. And of course you get your money back so you don&#8217;t have to lose any time worrying whether genuine altruism really exists.</p>
<p>However it&#8217;s worth bearing in mind that even though you may be helping one woman, her family and maybe her community (which is nothing to be sniffed at!) spreading capitalism to every corner of the earth isn&#8217;t necessarily the best way to help women as a group. Microloans don&#8217;t do much to tackle the structural causes of poverty and inequality. In fact they <a title="Wikipedia - Microcredit" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcredit" target="_blank">don&#8217;t always help</a> individual women.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t stop giving, but think about giving to projects that will also help women protect themselves from violence, disease and discrimination while they run their business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, here are three recent-ish comics, one good, one with potential but some issues, and one of them so eye-meltingly bad that quite possibly I am a worse person for having read it.</p>
<p>So, let’s start with the bad, because that’s where the fun is, right? Right.</p>
<h3><em>Neonomicon</em> – Alan Moore</h3>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/neonomicon.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="5770" data-permalink="/2011/05/31/yes-maybe-no-three-comics/neonomicon/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/neonomicon.jpg?fit=662%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="662,1024" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="neonomicon cover" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/neonomicon.jpg?fit=193%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/neonomicon.jpg?fit=662%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5770" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/neonomicon-193x300.jpg?resize=193%2C300" alt="Cover of issue 1 of Alan Moore's comic series Neonomicon.

<p>A four part mini-series that wrapped up just recently, <strong>Neonomicon</strong> was… well, it was, as much as we might wish it hadn’t been. A modern spin on Lovecraft’s Cthulu Mythos, <strong>Neonomicon</strong> actually looked like it had potential to start with. A good Mythos tale lures you in with mundane normality and then – bam! – unspeakable eldritch abomination and the creeping madness behind your eyes. In a similar way, <strong>Neonomicon</strong> lures you in with a clever enough idea and characters and then – bam! – racism and gang rape. We’ll get to that in a moment.</p>
<p>So, that acceptable start we mentioned. We’re given a pair of FBI agents investigating some strange goings on that very quickly become Mythos related. And hey, we think, the two lead characters are not square jawed white guys. We’ve got a female lead and a black male lead, nice to see some variety in character design for a change. Sure, some of the Lovecraft references are a bit heavy handed, but that’s okay.</p>
<p>And then the second issue happens. Our two agents have followed the lead to a Mythos sex shop in a quiet New England town. It’s not sure whether it wants to be creepy or played for laughs with some of the novelty items visible in the background. One thing leads to another, and they’re infiltrating a sex cult and… oh, now the guy has been shot, and the racial slurs are flowing freely. And now it’s gang rape time for the female agent. Thanks for that, Alan Moore.</p>
<p>Now, Moore did say (there&#8217;s a quote in <a href="http://www.theskinny.co.uk/article/100258-choose-your-reality-alan-moore-unearthed">this interview here</a>) that when he was writing this he thought (paraphrased): “&#8230;let’s put all of the unpleasant racial stuff back in, let’s put sex back in.”  And that could have been interesting, handled differently. It could have been a chance to tackle some of the issues with Lovecraft, to look at the fact that Lovecraft was a bit of a terrible racist and misogynist. But that isn’t what happens here. This isn’t a story that uses sex and racism to raise questions and make a point. It’s just a story full of non-consensual sex and racism. Or, as a friend put it: &#8220;If God were to look down upon this benighted planet in judgement, he’d probably think the place worthy of a second chance. Until he read<strong> Neonomicon</strong>. Then he’d remember why he commissioned the Book of Revelation in the first place.&#8221;</p>
<h3><em>Carbon Grey</em> – Hoan Nguyen</h3>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/550w_comics_carbon_grey.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="5771" data-permalink="/2011/05/31/yes-maybe-no-three-comics/550w_comics_carbon_grey/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/550w_comics_carbon_grey.jpg?fit=550%2C825&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="550,825" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Carbon Grey Cover" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/550w_comics_carbon_grey.jpg?fit=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/550w_comics_carbon_grey.jpg?fit=550%2C825&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5771" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/550w_comics_carbon_grey-200x300.jpg?resize=200%2C300" alt="Cover of issue 1 of Hoan Nguyen's comic Carbon Grey. Published by Image Comics" width="200" height="300" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/550w_comics_carbon_grey.jpg?w=200&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/550w_comics_carbon_grey.jpg?w=550&amp;ssl=1 550w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Carbon Grey</strong> is our “has potential, but also issues”. Let’s look at the potential first.</p>
<p>Set in a slightly steampunky spin on First World War-era Europe, the story follows the Sisters Grey. Each generation, we’re told, see three sisters born to the Grey family, hereditary defenders of the Kaiser. Three sisters, one for strength, one for grace, one for wisdom. Except in this generation, where the youngest sister has a twin, a fourth Grey, a sister for revolution.</p>
<p>What does this get us? It gets us explosions, and action, and the four very deadly Sisters Grey kicking ass and changing the face of politics in Mitteleuropa. It gets us spies and assassins and clever dialogue. And did I mention the ass-kicking? In the opening sequence of the first issue the youngest Grey pulls off more awesome action stuff than can be found in an entire <strong>Die Hard</strong> marathon.</p>
<p>The issues, then? Well, mostly it revolves around one thing: the art (which for the most part is very, very pretty, as long as you don’t mind the manga influences). With one notable exception in the form of a background character with no lines, all the female characters have essentially the same body type. It’s that improbable superhero-woman build, all gravity defying breasts and waist lines that surely don’t leave enough room for internal organs. The Queen of Germany lounges around in a scrap of white fabric that’d make Emma Frost blush.</p>
<p>The intro arc has just wrapped up, so now’s a good time to get in on the main story of Carbon Grey, if you can look past the art problems.</p>
<p>And now, on to the good.</p>
<h3><em>Scarlet</em> – Brian Michael Bendis</h3>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/scarlet-cover-issue-5-663x1024.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="5772" data-permalink="/2011/05/31/yes-maybe-no-three-comics/scarlet-cover-issue-5-663x1024/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/scarlet-cover-issue-5-663x1024.jpg?fit=663%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="663,1024" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Scarlet Cover" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/scarlet-cover-issue-5-663x1024.jpg?fit=194%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/scarlet-cover-issue-5-663x1024.jpg?fit=663%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5772" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/scarlet-cover-issue-5-663x1024-194x300.jpg?resize=194%2C300" alt="Cover for issue 5 of Brian Michael Bendis' comic, Scarlet. Published by Icon." width="194" height="300" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/scarlet-cover-issue-5-663x1024.jpg?w=194&amp;ssl=1 194w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/scarlet-cover-issue-5-663x1024.jpg?w=663&amp;ssl=1 663w" sizes="(max-width: 194px) 100vw, 194px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Bendis is a lot better on his creator-owned work than he is when he’s writing superheroes for Marvel, and <strong>Scarlet</strong> is among the best of his creator-owned stuff. The first plot arc just finished, so now’s as good a time as any to get started here.</p>
<p>Scarlet was a regular hipster kid in Portland, just generally existing. Then things went wrong and she learnt a harsh lesson in how messed up the world is. Now she’s running a grass-roots revolution. That’s the basic gist of the series. Oh, and she wants your help and is telling the whole story via fourth-wall breaking narration. Between some excellent lines and a fantastic snapshot life sketch in the first issue, we get Scarlet as a nicely well-developed character, someone we can accept as real.</p>
<p>It’s an interesting look at what it takes to shake someone out of their comfortable middle-class white comfort zone, and what they do next. And with everything being told to us via Scarlet, who very definitely has an agenda, we get to see how bias colours perception. The police and politicians aren’t all corrupt and evil, but seen through Scarlet’s eyes they become significantly darker. These aren’t events as they are, they’re events as one person believes they are. And I’m a sucker for an unreliable narrator.</p>
<p>The art serves as a distinct counterpoint to <strong>Carbon Grey’s</strong> over-the-top women and frequently absurd costumes. Scarlet, and the people she interacts with, look like real people. They dress, move and talk like real people. This is perhaps not surprising, given that (long-time Bendis collaborator and fantastic artist) <strong>Alex Maleev</strong> does a hell of a lot of photo referencing, to the point where it’s almost a comic equivalent of a rotoscoped film like <strong>A Scanner Darkly</strong>. It’s definitely nice to see, though.</p>
<p>So there you go. Go read <strong>Scarlet</strong>, consider <strong>Carbon Grey</strong>, and bin any spare copies of <strong>Neonomicon</strong> you find, before Judgement Day rolls around.</p>

You&#8217;ve studied Anglo-Irish supernatural fiction at university, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhartach">Abhartach</a> appears in <em>Róisín Dubh</em> and the ghost of Oscar Wilde turns up in your other comics project, <em>Jennifer Wilde</em>. Which other myths or historical figures can we expect to turn up in <em>Róisín Dubh</em>,  and do you have any favourite people, legends or mythological monsters from Irish history and folklore?</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Robert Curley at Atomic Diner comics pitched the core idea of <strong>Róisín Dubh</strong> to me and told me about the existing myth around Abhartach. I did what I  always do: research. I thought a great deal about the time period, the story of Abhartach, Róisín herself and her situation.</p>
<p>For me, I need to find what I think of a &#8216;mythic resonance&#8217; in a story that I&#8217;m trying to create. Making a character swing a sword and lop off a head is easy: making a story with horror and fantasy elements feel like it could possibly be real requires that it resemble mythology itself.</p>
<p>So, I went back to my books on Irish mythology &#8211; of which I have many  &#8211; and kept reading until elements connected with what I already had in  my head about the story. I added a few Irish gods into the mix, a  companion character and a couple of magical items. I widened the canvas. And I gave Róisín a very painful thing to do, which happens in issue 2 and is something that will haunt her forever. </p>
<p>Equally, I thought a lot about Abhartach. I don&#8217;t like simplistic villains. I added to his backstory and made him into a person who does unpleasant things, but who has motivations and reasons for his view of the world. Thankfully, Rob was very receptive to me bringing all this to the characters and the story!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been reading mythological stories from all cultures since childhood. One story that holds a lot of fascination for me is &#8216;the descent into the underworld&#8217;. There is a variation on that in issue 1 of <strong>Róisín Dubh</strong> &#8211; though I&#8217;m not always aware of every element like this that I&#8217;m tapping into when I write the story. Sometimes it doesn&#8217;t become obvious until later.</p>
<p>Ultimately, when writing I try to feed my subconscious to stuffing point with lots of influences and then allow it to serve me up suggestions as I&#8217;m going on. I trust it to give me the right element at the right time. Then, some time afterwards, I marvel at how it all came together. That&#8217;s when it&#8217;s really doing its job.</p>
<p>But I have days when it gives me nothing and I soldier on anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Creating a comic book in this way, with a separate writer  and artist, is a collaborative process, and one that tends to be favoured by most American and European publishers. How did this process work for you, how much input did the artists have, and what was it like seeing your character come to life in their hands?</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;The collaborative element is what I enjoy the most. I can&#8217;t tell you how amazing it is to see the words I&#8217;ve written translated into images. Mostly, it&#8217;s better than I hoped.  Sometimes we&#8217;ll discuss how a certain panel is working and ask for changes.</p>
<p>No one is going to draw the Róisín in my head unless I do &#8211; so I have  to allow the artists to bring their version of her to the page.  A successful comic book collaboration &#8211; in my experience &#8211; is about respecting the strengths each person brings to the project. The writer understands story dynamics and the artist knows visual storytelling. You have to learn to depend on the other person&#8217;s knowledge and experience to guide changes in the comic book.</p>
<p>Also, you have to be open to seeing things from a different perspective, and accepting change. I&#8217;m always happy when the artist makes suggestions that are innovative and work better than my original concept.  We&#8217;re all pulling together for the same goal: to create a comic book people will enjoy.&#8221;</p>

You&#8217;re a busy woman! Why don&#8217;t you tell  us a bit more about the projects you&#8217;re working on at the moment besides <em>Róisín Dubh</em>?</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://jenniferwildecomic.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Jennifer Wilde</strong></a> is a fun project. Again, Robert Curley came to me with the core idea, and I went off and did my research &#8211; and that was just brilliant. The 1920s was an amazing era of change: social, economic, and cultural. The story is lighter, and more in the detective genre &#8211; albeit with a  supernatural element.  Jennifer is a French artist who &#8211; through personal  tragedy &#8211; becomes embroiled in a mystery that takes her from France, to England and finally to Ireland &#8211; all helped by the ghost of Oscar Wilde.</p>
<p>Writing Wilde is the most intimidating aspect of the project. I&#8217;ve done a lot of research on him, and he was a brilliant, complex man, but not always wonderful. I try to be respectful of who he was and to bring as much of that to the project as possible.</p>
<p>Most of the art is complete on issue 1, and it should be out in about six weeks. Our artist Stephen Downey has done a fantastic job.  I&#8217;m currently working on the scripts for issue 2 and 3. Issue 2 of <strong>Róisín Dubh</strong> is in the editing stage at the moment, so that should be good to go soon enough.</p>
<p>I usually have other projects in the sidelines, in various stages of  completion: non-fiction, screenplays short stories, poetry, a novel. I even have an idea for a comic book strip, which I would draw as well as write. These projects go up and down in priority depending on deadlines.</p>
<p>All things going well, I&#8217;ll probably write another volume of <strong>Róisín Dubh</strong> and <strong>Jennifer Wilde</strong> for <a href="http://www.atomicdiner.com/">Atomic Diner</a>. I&#8217;d also like to create and write my own comic book series. I have several stories in development.</p>
<p>As well as this I have my job with the Irish Playwrights&#8217; and Screenwriters&#8217; Guild as their blogger and website-wrangler.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s good to be busy!&#8221;</p>
