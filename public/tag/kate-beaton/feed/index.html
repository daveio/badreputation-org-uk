					<description><![CDATA[‘How do you spot a snake vampire cultist lady? She’ll be playing snakes and ladders. In thigh high boots.’]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://filmburble.wordpress.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Emily McQuade</strong></a> takes the guest post slot now. She last wrote <a href="/2013/02/27/guest-post-the-countess-is-waiting-for-you-daughters-of-darkness/" target="_blank">a highly amusing piece for us on the movie <strong>Daughters of Darkness</strong></a>, so we asked her to pick another favourite female monster from the silver screen for Halloween. Then the Ed wasn&#8217;t well for a bit, so we didn&#8217;t put the post up for a while. But here it is now! Do you have a guest pitch? Pitch that pitch to <a href="mailto:badrepeditors@gmail.com"><strong>badrepeditors@gmail.com</strong></a>!</em></li>
</ul>
<p>One thing to be aware of when watching any of Ken Russell’s films is that you will spend at least three quarters of the running time saying to yourself, ‘What THE HELL am I watching.’</p>
<p>Mr Russell’s <strong>The Lair of the White Worm</strong> (1988) is so bizarre that&#8230; well, let’s just take a look at the notes I made the last time I watched it: </p>
<blockquote><p>‘How do you spot a snake vampire cultist lady? She’ll be playing snakes and ladders. In thigh high boots.’ </p>
<p>‘Gratuitous historically inaccurate nun torture.’ </p>
<p>‘Where IS Peter Capaldi keeping that mongoose?’ </p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Lair_of_the_white_worm.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="14252" data-permalink="/2013/12/03/guest-post-lady-sylvia-lair-white-worm/lair_of_the_white_worm/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Lair_of_the_white_worm.jpg?fit=325%2C483&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="325,483" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Lair_of_the_white_worm" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Lair_of_the_white_worm.jpg?fit=201%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Lair_of_the_white_worm.jpg?fit=325%2C483&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Lair_of_the_white_worm-201x300.jpg?resize=201%2C300" alt="Lair_of_the_white_worm" width="201" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-14252" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Lair_of_the_white_worm.jpg?resize=201%2C300&amp;ssl=1 201w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Lair_of_the_white_worm.jpg?w=325&amp;ssl=1 325w" sizes="(max-width: 201px) 100vw, 201px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Very loosely based on Bram Stoker’s original story, the film takes an olde worlde horror setup and adds a fantastic lady monster (Lady Sylvia Marsh, as played by Amanda Donohoe – a saucy aristocratic predator who thinks white three corner hats are casual wear) and a high pile of hallucinatory WTF.</p>
<p>(Unfortunately, Bram Stoker’s <strong>The Lair of the White Worm</strong> is not a great read. It’s got potential – Lovecraftian horrors stirring beneath the English countryside – but it’s clunky as hell. And contains so much sexism and racism that it reads like an unsubtle parody of a Victorian horror tale.) </p>
<p>Peter Capaldi plays Angus, an archaeology student who finds the skull of some kind of monster in the garden of a B&#038;B in Derbyshire. The B&#038;B is run by two sisters – Eve and Mary (Catherine Oxenberg and Sammi Davis. Note the unsubtle choice of names) whose mother has disappeared in mysterious circumstances. </p>
<p>Then Lord D’Ampton (Hugh Grant) invites them to his ancestral hall for an 80s folk/rock party, where he re-enacts the legendary tale of an ancestor of his, who killed a giant worm (guess what colour it was.) that was terrorising the village some centuries previously. </p>
<p>(The beast that his ancestor had the squabble with was the D’Ampton Worm. As in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambton_Worm" target="_blank">Lambton Worm</a>. Both Stoker’s and Russell’s version of ‘White Worm’ take place in Derbyshire and not Durham. There were a lot of worm monsters about in the olden days, apparently.)</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/LairWorm.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="14255" data-permalink="/2013/12/03/guest-post-lady-sylvia-lair-white-worm/lairworm/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/LairWorm.jpg?fit=600%2C862&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="600,862" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="LairWorm" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/LairWorm.jpg?fit=208%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/LairWorm.jpg?fit=600%2C862&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/LairWorm-208x300.jpg?resize=208%2C300" alt="LairWorm" width="208" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-14255" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/LairWorm.jpg?resize=208%2C300&amp;ssl=1 208w, https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/LairWorm.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w" sizes="(max-width: 208px) 100vw, 208px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>This gets Angus wondering – could his new-found skull have something to do with the one in the tale? Lord D’Ampton is foppishly sceptical. And then Lady Sylvia slinks into view. And spits venom on a crucifix. I haven’t seen <strong>Downton Abbey</strong> for ages, but I’m pretty sure that her TV namesake is not in  the habit of doing such things.</p>
<p>What follows is an unsettling campfest. Lady Sylvia does some horrible things (that poor boy scout) but she’s also horribly fascinating. I don’t know if she was meant to be a satire on the ‘sexy sex ladies who are EVIIILL’ trope or an unsubtle parody of 80s decadence (see Kate Beaton’s <a href="http://www.harkavagrant.com/index.php?id=285" target="_blank">marvellous Dracula cartoon</a> for a nice pisstake of how this trope came up in Stoker’s most famous tale). But either way Ms Donohue looks to be really enjoying herself. </p>
<p>Eve and Mary are sketchily drawn characters – it transpires that Eve is a virgin, which makes her sacrifice fodder for the great big worm beast living under Sylvia’s mansion (paging Doctor Freud). Lord D’Ampton has some rude dreams and tries to fix things with his super posh man skillz. Eventually, Angus has to face vamped up Sylvia alone. Yep, Peter Capaldi is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_girl" target="_blank">Final Girl</a>. </p>
<p>He does a bit of snake charming with a kilt and a set of bagpipes. And a mongoose. If anyone’s concerned that <strong>Doctor Who</strong>-loving kids might come across Malcolm Tucker’s epic swears by accident online, wait until they get a load of this.</p>
<p><strong>Lair of the White Worm</strong> is basically awesome trash. Or it’s trash cinema French kissing arthouse cinema down a dingy alleyway. And sometimes that’s what you want.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[That's right, folks: I'm talking about babies.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>For more about this series on Romance Novel Tropes, read <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/08/01/new-series-hopeless-reimantic/">Rei&#8217;s Hopeless Reimantic intro post</a> and <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/08/20/hopeless-reimantic-part-one-virginal-heroines/" target="_blank">Part 1: Virginal Heroines</a>.</em></p>
<p>(The author recognises that the phenomenon discussed below is not, in fact, limited to people who are married and in love. I&#8217;ll get to marriage in romance novels some other time.)</p>
<p>[<strong>TRIGGER WARNING:</strong> Discussion of infertility and failed pregnancies below.]</p>
<p>[<strong>SPOILER WARNING: </strong>This piece discusses happenings from the first and third episodes of the new season of <strong>Doctor Who</strong>, as well as containing mild spoilers for <strong>Game Of Thrones</strong>.]</p>
<p>Last time on <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/category/bookshelf/hopeless-reimantic-bookshelf/" target="_blank"><strong>Hopeless Reimantic</strong></a> we talked about virginal heroines, and while I wasn&#8217;t totally positive on the topic, I will give the virginal heroine this: at least most of the time, she doesn&#8217;t stay virginal throughout the book. That trope has an expiration date, if you will. This next one is actually significantly more irritating to me &#8211; partly, admittedly, because it&#8217;s outside my experience in a way that I have no particular interest in remedying, but mainly because even if I didn&#8217;t feel that way I still think I&#8217;d find the topic clumsily handled and often just shoehorned in to make the romance more&#8230;legitimate.</p>

Image by the illustrious Kate Beaton (http://www.harkavagrant.com), shirt by topatoco.</p></div>
<p>That&#8217;s right, folks: I&#8217;m talking about babies. Well, in brief. I suppose more accurately (and more vaguely) what I&#8217;m talking about is parenthood.</p>
<p>I suppose putting this column in second is kind of cheating, because it jumps to the end of the standard romance novel narrative &#8211; or, depending on how much edginess we&#8217;re going for, about three-quarters of the way through &#8211; and for that I apologise, but I promise you that the baby trope is all-pervasive enough that it&#8217;s not going  to matter. An Extremely Standard Romance Novel, you see, goes something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>[Play]boy meets [virgin] girl</li>
<li>They deny their attraction to one another for a while (usually this consists of Mr Man insisting that our heroine is Just Like All Other Women and although she makes his dick hard he could never actually love her, and our heroine protesting any kind of attraction to Mr Man at all)</li>
<li>Inevitably, sex.</li>
<li>A brief honeymoon period, usually compounded by more sex</li>
<li>Some kind of big misunderstanding that breaks them apart [at this point the heroine may or may not discover that she is pregnant]</li>
<li>Reunion. Marriage. BABIES.</li>
</ol>
<p>The story outlined above is common to a lot of romance novels (including our old friend from last time, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Bought-Destitute-Yet-Defiant-ebook/dp/B004NBZGGK/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1345324117&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank"><strong>Bought: Destitute Yet Defiant</strong></a>) but it is by no means the only sprog-imbued narrative out there in Romancelandia. Nor is it even the most baby-heavy. A quick search on <a href="http://dearauthor.com/" target="_blank">Dear Author</a> for &#8220;babies&#8221; turned up eight pages of hits and reminded me that Dear Author actually <a href="http://dearauthor.com/tag/secret-baby/" target="_blank">has a tag</a> for &#8220;secret baby&#8221; plotlines &#8211; yes, they exist, and they&#8217;re common enough that they get their own category on review sites. These stories might start out with two separated lovers meeting again after many years &#8211; but wait! She has a child! The fact that it&#8217;s <em>his</em> child is blindingly obvious throughout, but often only revealed at the very end! What could be more romantic?</p>
<p>A nicely infuriating example of this trope on my Kindle is a little tale called <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Emergency-Wife-Lost-Found-ebook/dp/B004NBZGFQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1348656852&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank"><strong>Emergency: Wife Lost and Found</strong></a> &#8211; a Mills&amp;Boon Medical Romance by Carol Marinelli that, to be fair, I have to admit was less awful upon revisitation than I remember it being the first time around. It&#8217;s a reunion tale between two doctors who met in medical school and married young because &#8211; shockingly &#8211; they got pregnant, but whose marriage then fell apart upon the loss of the baby.</p>

The loss of a child is a devastating one, and especially to a couple who married essentially because of the child (there are some token protests that it would have happened anyway because they were in Real True Love, but still) &#8211; I can only imagine the effects of that on their relationship. It&#8217;s no wonder they divorced, and believeable that their meeting again after so long would be fraught with emotional tension (and I don&#8217;t wanna go into the whole thing, but there&#8217;s a lot of emotional tension for their meeting to be fraught with). And it&#8217;s understandable that some of the tension between them also comes from Lorna, the heroine, having since discovered that due to <a href="http://www.endometriosis-uk.org/" target="_blank">endometriosis</a> she&#8217;s unlikely to carry another pregnancy to term. I would actually have been extremely interested in a book that <em>had</em> dealt with those issues &#8211; that explored the characters coming to term with Lorna&#8217;s infertility, and how that might have changed or strengthened their relationship.</p>
<p>The thing is, the book doesn&#8217;t actually deal with any of those issues. It skates over them briefly, and then True Love Sex happens, and Lorna&#8230;gets pregnant. Magically. And by the book&#8217;s epilogue, she has another child on the way, and her happiness is complete. See, true love fixed her!</p>
<p>Secret babies and miracle pregnancies are not limited to contemporary romance fiction, either, although it&#8217;s only here that the total absence (or extremely brief, give-it-one-sentence-and-handwave-it-away mentions of) abortion, adoption (either way!) and foster care are so totally and thoroughly angering. Historicals often feature a heroine whose dark secret is that, for whatever reason, she thinks she can&#8217;t have children but then, inexplicably, has at least one child by the end of the book; the widow whose husband never gave her children, but who then meets the hero and gets pregnant so fast you&#8217;d think they had some sort of corresponding velcro arrangement, is a particularly common one. Because that is the miracle that true love can provide.</p>
<p>True love also, incidentally, provides the incentive for wanting the kids in the first place in roughly half of these cases &#8211; there are quite a lot of cases of heroines (and heroes, to be fair) for whom a family was always endgame, but also a depressing number of heroines who get pregnant, having never wanted or thought about children before, and are midway through a totally justified freakout when they realise that the baby must be Mr Man&#8217;s and melt into a puddle of warm, maternal goo and aren&#8217;t scared anymore. And don&#8217;t get me started on the reaction some heroes have to this. I distinctly remember a book I read a few months ago &#8211; it was called <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Momentary-Marriage-ebook/dp/B008OJ8AEC/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1348657105&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank"><strong>Momentary Marriage</strong></a>, one of those &#8220;we&#8217;ll just marry for a year or so to help us both out of a jam that could totally not be solved any other way!&#8221; storylines &#8211; and the hero of our tale not only makes plans to impregnate the heroine without her knowledge so that she&#8217;ll stay with him, but spends about half a page getting turned on at the idea. If art does imitate life, there are a lot more pregnancy fetishists out there than you&#8217;d expect. All I&#8217;m sayin&#8217;.</p>
<p>The thing is, while this trope may be extremely common in romance novels &#8211; overwhelmingly, nauseatingly common, even &#8211; it isn&#8217;t confined to them. Remember <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_of_the_Daleks" target="_blank"><strong>Asylum of the Daleks</strong></a>, the first episode of the new season of <strong>Doctor Who</strong>? That one that came out a few weeks ago? Remember Rory and Amy&#8217;s Fifty Seconds Of Conflict, when he shouts at her for leaving him and her response is WELL YOU WANTED CHILDREN AND I CAN&#8217;T HAVE THEM, SO I GAVE YOU UP RATHER THAN ACTUALLY TRY TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS? Yeah. Because in the UK in 2012, apparently adoption doesn&#8217;t exist, and neither does speaking to your partner. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Town_Called_Mercy" target="_blank">Later on</a> in the series we have Mad Scientist Alien, who looks at Amy and can immediately tell that she&#8217;s had children because she is sad and fierce and caring, as if motherhood is the only experience that could confer these characteristics. Genre-hopping a bit to <strong>Game of Thrones</strong>, we have Daenerys Targaryen, who becomes a mother to her people because she&#8217;s never going to have children who aren&#8217;t dragons. (Which I personally don&#8217;t see the problem with. I would <em>much</em> rather have dragon-babies than baby-babies, although I suppose feeding them would be something of a negotiation.) And these are just the examples I can think of off the top of my head.</p>
<p>I appreciate that a lot of people do want children. I appreciate that some would even go so far as to say that their children are the best things in their lives, and that is valid and legitimate and completely worthy of representation in fiction. In spite of all that, though,  as you may be able to tell, I have extremely little patience with this trope, and I&#8217;m going to try and explain why without sputtering too incoherently. Bear with me a moment.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>First of all, I have a huge problem with motherhood being portrayed as the only really worthwhile thing a woman can aspire to. Motherhood is worthwhile, and it is important, and it deserves to be venerated and respected. But I object to the idea that it is the <em>only</em> thing that is worthwhile and important and worthy of veneration and respect. This elevation to the exclusion of all other things is not, as I&#8217;m not the first person to point out, extended to fatherhood, either &#8211; a man who never has children may well have been doing other, equally important, things, whereas a woman who&#8217;s never had children is often seen as an object of either pity or scorn. </p>
<p>So far, it seems that the only wish-fulfilment medium aimed specifically at women overwhelmingly portrays babies as the reward a good woman gets for being a good person and a good lover and without which no other goodness is really, truly good. Where does that leave women who have real-life style infertility &#8211; the kind that isn&#8217;t fixed by falling in lasting love &#8211; or those who just never had that wish in the first place?</p>
<p>And that brings me to my next point. I&#8217;d like everyone to bear in mind, by the way, that I say this next part as a person who doesn&#8217;t actually <em>like</em> children that much. I&#8217;ve definitely mellowed towards them as I&#8217;ve grown older &#8211; meeting some actually nice ones that I wasn&#8217;t forced to hang out with because I was presenting female at the time has helped &#8211; but I&#8217;m not a particular fan. They&#8217;re okay; I might want my own someday, but right now I&#8217;m leaning towards not. (That&#8217;s right, Friend Of My Friend&#8217;s Family Who Wrote Me That Poem About How Not Having Kids Is A Waste Of My Genes Five Years Ago<sup><a href="/2012/09/26/hopeless-reimantic-2-that-thing-that-comes-after-love-and-marriage/#footnote_0_12444" id="identifier_0_12444" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" True freaking story. ">1</a></sup> &#8211; the answer&#8217;s still no.)</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s review, shall we? So far this segment we&#8217;ve talked about pregnancy, secret pregnancy, miracle pregnancy, infertility, abortion, adoption and the concept of motherhood.</p>
<p>What have we not &#8211; really &#8211; talked about?</p>
<p>Any actual babies.</p>
<p>I do understand that it can be difficult to write about the children in child-plotlines themselves, especially if the story in question is actually supposed to be focused on relationships between adults. But there&#8217;s a pretty big difference between &#8220;this character is important but doesn&#8217;t really do much beyond eat and cry and poop, so I can&#8217;t write too much about them&#8221; and &#8220;we need something important in this story! What&#8217;s important to women? BABIES! Let&#8217;s put some babies in here&#8221;. </p>
<p>I suppose my overwhelming thought is that if it&#8217;s so difficult to write about pregnancies or children in a well-rounded way that makes them more than plot devices (or Plot Moppets, as the good folk over at Smart Bitches refer to them) writers should maybe think more carefully about including a pregnancy storyline, and how to treat it if they do decide to put one in (as, er, it were). Babies are the tiny humans that shape the future of our world. They deserve more respect than that.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it for today! Next time on Hopeless Reimantic&#8230;either marriage or playboy heroes, I haven&#8217;t decided yet.</p>
<p>See you then!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following on from Miranda&#8217;s  illustrator-themed posts a while back (<a title="Illustration Interlude" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/02/02/illustration-interlude/">here</a> and <a title="Another Illustration Interlude" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/02/14/another-illustration-interlude/">here</a>) I thought I&#8217;d send a few more graphical delights your way.</p>
<p>I say &#8216;feminist&#8217; up there, I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;s how all these artists would define themselves, but if you are a feminist or even have an interest in gender I think you may find a lot to love in their work. To be honest I&#8217;m not even sure they&#8217;d all call themselves cartoonists either&#8230; You may well have heard of them before, but if not, you&#8217;re in for a treat.</p>

<p>I picked up <strong><a title="Fantagraphics - I Love Led Zeppelin" href="http://www.fantagraphics.com/browse-shop/i-love-led-zeppelin-5.html?vmcchk=1" target="_blank">I Love Led Zeppelin</a></strong> after Forney was mentioned in Trina Robbins&#8217; fantastic book <strong><a title="From Girls to Grrrlz" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/From-Girls-Grrrlz-Trina-Robbins/dp/0811821994/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1340993055&amp;sr=1-2" target="_blank">From Girls to Grrrlz</a></strong>. It would have been worth it just for the fantastic &#8216;how to&#8217; series, which include: how to re-attach an amputated finger, how to dominate someone, how to talk to your kids about drugs. But there&#8217;s lots of good stuff here (especially if you like your stuff on the queer side) and I love Forney&#8217;s warm, clear lines.</p>

<p>Artist, doll-maker, banjo-player, part-time mermaid&#8230; Dame Darcy is morbid and fabulous just like her comic <strong><a title="Fantagraphics - Meat Cake" href="http://www.fantagraphics.com/index.php?keyword=meat+cake&amp;Search=Search&amp;Itemid=62&amp;option=com_virtuemart&amp;page=shop.browse" target="_blank">Meat Cake</a></strong>, which largely defies description. A bizarre and chaotic mix of Victoriana, fairytales, gothic and goth, <strong>Meat Cake</strong> has a cast of equally strange characters which include a smooth-talking wolf, a superbitch mermaid, and the tragic undead Strega Pez who can communicate only through messages delivered on Pez-like tablets from her slashed throat. Makes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloomcookie"><strong>Gloom Cookie</strong></a> look like <strong>The Archers</strong>.</p>

<p>Sydney Padua is responsible for taking the already badass Ada Lovelace, putting her in breeches, giving her a raygun and setting her off on a series of steampunk adventures where she can use MATHS to fight crime, solve mysteries, battle vampire poets etc&#8230; There&#8217;s a book on the way it seems, but in the meantime you can buy <a title="Zazzle - Sydney Padua" href="http://www.zazzle.com/sydney_padua" target="_blank"><strong>2D Goggles</strong> merch</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[*Dramatic pause* Feminism killed chivalry! Gasp. But you knew that already.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chivalry is dead, I&#8217;m told. And now you are all conveniently gathered here in the lobby of this stylish hotel / bar of this cruise ship / dining car of this luxury train I am ready to unmask the culprit. Yes, she&#8217;s here in the room with us. *Dramatic pause* Feminism killed chivalry!</p>
<p>Gasp.</p>
<p>But you knew that already. It&#8217;s the least mysterious murder mystery ever. Even <a title="Wikipedia - Hastings" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Hastings" target="_blank">Hastings</a> could have cracked it (well, maybe). Just google &#8220;chivalry is dead!&#8221; and you&#8217;ll find plenty of witnesses to testify to the fact that it was feminism what done it.</p>
<p>It is also, apparently, a tragic case of mistaken identity as countless Daily Fail and Torygraph writers assert that chivalry wasn&#8217;t even sexist. It&#8217;s just about being nice to women. Isn&#8217;t that what you want, slavering harpy hordes? For us to be nice to you?</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/DSCF4215.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="9462" data-permalink="/2012/01/25/keep-the-gift-pay-what-you-owe/dscf4215/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/DSCF4215.jpg?fit=350%2C262&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="350,262" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Knight" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/DSCF4215.jpg?fit=300%2C224&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/DSCF4215.jpg?fit=350%2C262&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-9462" title="Knight" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/DSCF4215.jpg?resize=350%2C262" alt="Knight in plate armour.

I spend quite a lot of time arguing about gender on the internet, as you might imagine. And recently the most inflammatory topic seems to be chivalry. Sparked by a call from Graham Linehan on Twitter for chivalry to be resurrected (see <a title="Glinner twitter status" href="https://twitter.com/#!/Glinner/status/132627658944151552" target="_blank">here</a> and <a title="Glinner status 2" href="https://twitter.com/#!/Glinner/status/132630145675694080" target="_blank">here</a>) I&#8217;ve gotten into a number or heated discussions disputing the value of chivalry today. Sadly, I believe rumours of the death of chivalry to have been greatly exaggerated.</p>
<p>Some people I spoke to claimed that they were defending chivalry as a general approach, towards all genders. But isn&#8217;t that just &#8216;not being an arse&#8217;? Why does it need a special name? Especially one with such deeply gendered associations. However pure the intention, bringing chivalry back from the dead serves no one. It&#8217;s a problematic idea in any context because it fetishises an imbalance of power. It&#8217;s fairness as charity rather than right, in which a privileged group extend a superficial form of power to another group along highly formalised lines.</p>
<p>As it is most commonly understood, as a code of behaviour for men towards women, chivalry is sexist. As <a title="Traditional romance is creepy" href="http://pandagon.net/index.php/site/comments/traditional_romance_is_creepy" target="_blank">Amanda Marcotte</a> says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Chivalry is a set of behaviors where men feign servitude and humility towards women, but in practice they tend to actually reinforce men&#8217;s greater social status.</p></blockquote>
<p>In my recent conversations I&#8217;ve been confirmed in my suspicion that there are a lot of Nice Guys out there who don&#8217;t want to hear this. I think the most common objections I&#8217;ve encountered go like this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;But I believe in equality/I&#8217;m a feminist, how dare you tell me I&#8217;m sexist just for being nice to women? That doesn&#8217;t fit with my carefully constructed self-image *cries*&#8221;</p>
<p>Following codes of behaviour towards women forged hundreds of years ago isn&#8217;t really an act of gender resistance. Sorry. Try turning your deeply-held commitment to equality to use by being considerate and respectful to everybody. If you already are: great! Why not drop the silly name for it?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;But I&#8217;m only being nice. Would you rather I punched you in the face rather than opening the door for you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Are you nice in this way to everyone? If so, good for you! If not: lots of women find chivalric or &#8216;gentlemanly&#8217; behaviour patronising or irritating at best, and creepy and coercive at worst.  Of course I prefer chivalry to brazen misogyny, but those aren&#8217;t the only choices, people. And both enshrine an archaic, damaging attitude toward women and reinforce the idea that women should be treated as women rather than as people.</p>
<p>You may have seen the pithy, ironic poems by suffragist Alice Duer Miller that Lili Loofbourow shared on the <a title="Hairpin - Are Women People?" href="http://thehairpin.com/2012/01/are-women-people" target="_blank">Hairpin</a> the other day. Her meditation on chivalry is one of my favourites, and neatly captures the problems with the idea:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s treating a woman politely<br />
As long as she isn&#8217;t a fright:<br />
It&#8217;s guarding the girls who act rightly,<br />
If you can be judge of what&#8217;s right;<br />
It&#8217;s being—not just, but so pleasant;<br />
It&#8217;s tipping while wages are low;<br />
It&#8217;s making a beautiful present,<br />
And failing to pay what you owe.</p></blockquote>
<p>Exactly. Women are owed equality. In the context of hundreds of years of struggle to be taken seriously, for agency, autonomy, self-representation, and social, political and economic power, the feeble gift of a seat or a door held open can feel like a joke. Or even an insult. For me it acts as a reminder of the social expectation &#8211; even now &#8211; <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/12/20/an-alphabet-of-femininism-12-l-is-for-lady/">to be ladylike</a>. Grateful, graceful, delicate. Powerless.</p>
<h3>Epilogue</h3>
<p>Besides, chivalry can quickly become desperately tedious, as <a title="Hark! A Vagrant" href="http://harkavagrant.com/" target="_blank">Kate Beaton</a> understands:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Quick one this week, as some of us are COVERED IN PREP for their <a href="http://newcrossturnleft.blogspot.com/">Other Projects</a>. The dirty traitors. </p>
<ul>
<li>Pablo K (for the second week running; clearly it&#8217;s a love-in) in a response to <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/06/24/we-are-man-falls-over/">our Sarah J&#8217;s post on the <strong>We Are Man!</strong> campaign</a>, has <a href="http://thedisorderofthings.wordpress.com/2011/06/25/we-are-the-genuine-hegemonic-masculine-a-note-on-anti-rape-politics/">some worthwhile things to say over on The Disorder of Things about marketing and anti-rape campaigns</a>. </li>
<li>Hark! A Vagrant brings us <a href="http://harkavagrant.com/">STRONG FEMALE CHARACTERS </a>and is bang on the money about everything, as usual.(Bonus: and now <a href="http://www.comicsalliance.com/2011/06/30/strong-female-characters-inspires-strong-female-fan-art-animt/">all the fanart ever has been created</a>, which is probably a little ironic in ways we can&#8217;t quite put our finger on.)</li>
<li>As the Guardian trumpets that <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/jun/29/la-barbe-feminism-france">French feminism is back &#8211; with beards</a> (it went somewhere, apparently), <a href="http://ladyfestparis.tumblr.com/">Ladyfest Paris 2011</a> is this weekend. Anyone in France read us? (Google Analytics says quite possibly, so go for a wander and tell us all about it.)</li>
<li>Womankind Worldwide launch a wonderful slideshow titled <a href="http://www.womankind.org.uk/">&#8220;Our Work With Men&#8221;</a>. </li>

<li>It&#8217;s the <strong>Twelfth Annual International Transgender Day of Remembrance</strong> on 20th November. There&#8217;s an event in Brighton on Sunday 21st November.  <a href="http://www.transgenderdor.org/">Read more about events around the world, and what the day itself is all about, here</a>. In brief, it&#8217;s an event to remember everyone who has died this year as a result of widespread prejudice against genderqueer and transpeople.  The list is deeply saddening. Some of the BR team will be going to the Brighton event, and hopefully there will be lots of people there.</li>
<li>Gabby Schulz: comic on <a href="http://www.gabbysplayhouse.com/?p=1444">sexism and online etiquette.</a> (Invoked debate to the tune of <em>666 </em>comments!)</li>
<li>It would be churlish at this point not to link to Kate Beaton&#8217;s <a href="http://harkavagrant.com/">Hark! A Vagrant</a>, which if you haven&#8217;t checked out before, you should.  You may well be aware of it already, but it bears repeating, because when I first discovered it, I cheered at my monitor screen with the kind of excitement I&#8217;d not exhibited since about 1994 when Terry Deary&#8217;s <em>Horrible Histories</em> were my favourite buys at the school Book Fair.<em> </em> Contains Susan B Anthony, Wonder Woman, Tesla, mermaids, and the Brides of Dracula supporting universal suffrage.</li>
<li><a href="http://dontinterrupt.tumblr.com/">Don&#8217;t Interrupt</a> &#8211; Lizzie B blogs &#8220;work, politics, the media and being a woman.  So just about everything, except, of course, the kitchen sink&#8221;. Nice.</li>
<li>This blog was featured recently in Marie Claire magazine, no less, and frankly, you can&#8217;t knock their taste on this one bit: <a href="http://velvetcoalmine.wordpress.com/">Rhian Jones on Velvet Coalmine blogs music and politics.</a></li>
<li>Here&#8217;re some blogs aiming to engage male readers with gender issues and/or feminism: <a href="http://mendaredo.com/">What Men Dare Do</a>, <a href="http://feministallies.blogspot.com/">Feminist Allies</a>, and <a href="http://goodmenproject.com/">The Good Men Project</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2010/04/how-to-make-showering-awesome-again.html">Hyperbole And A Half joins the pressing debate for the alpha dude on How To Make Showering Awesome Again.</a> Well, have YOU ever seen a coconut burst into flames from sheer excellence?</li>
