										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This post is belated &#8211; I thought I&#8217;d lost these pictures on an old phone &#8211; but wonder of wonders, miracle of miracles, I found them on my computer the other day. </p>
<p>Some time in 2010 or 2011 (I&#8217;m dating this by my handset) the Harley Medical Group started advertising plastic surgery on the tube. Images of pert models told women that they needed &#8216;new year, new confidence&#8217;. Plastic surgery is nothing new, but pushing that advertising on people as they go up the escalators was a new and unwelcome assault. &#8220;You&#8217;re on your way to work, by the way, have you considered that your tits could be better?&#8221; Then something wonderful happened: people started answering back. (Click on images for zoom.)<br />

<p>I was tickled to see a few with red printed &#8216;sexist shit&#8217; stickers which I&#8217;d seen sold at a feminist event a couple of weeks before&#8230; but then more appeared. People were writing their own slogans on stickers and whacking them on as the escalator sped them past. At first I just saw them at Kings Cross where I commuted through every day. Then, little by little, I saw them in more and more places. More handwriting, more slogans. This was&#8230; a movement.</p>

And then, as the posters went away, so the stickers did too. I noticed there was a second wave of plastic surgery ads a few months later which seemed to have toned down their rhetoric a little. Still crap that unnecessary surgery was being pushed on women but something seemed to have twigged with the advertisers, too. This level of crap will not stand. I salute you, culture-jammers of London. Long may you reign.</p>
