					<description><![CDATA[Sinfest is one of my favourite webcomics.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.sinfest.net/"><strong>Sinfest</strong></a> is one of my favourite webcomics. I can&#8217;t quite work out why I haven&#8217;t written it up as a Found Feminism before, I guess I just made the assumption that like kittens with captions, everyone already knew about it. The strip has been going for a while, and I love the mix of anti-dinner table talk  (politics, sex and religion) with the more winsome or just for gags strips.  It&#8217;s updated pretty regularly and has a massive archive so I&#8217;ve just fixed that question over what you are going to do for the next week &#8211; go read!</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Sinfest-comics.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="7990" data-permalink="/2011/10/25/found-feminism-sinfest/sinfest-comics/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Sinfest-comics.jpg?fit=337%2C262&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="337,262" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Sinfest comics" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Sinfest-comics.jpg?fit=300%2C233&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Sinfest-comics.jpg?fit=337%2C262&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7990" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Sinfest-comics-300x233.jpg?resize=300%2C233" alt="" width="300" height="233" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Sinfest-comics.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Sinfest-comics.jpg?w=337&amp;ssl=1 337w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>On the face of it, a drugs-and-porn fuelled pig, bikini devil girls and a lead female character who talks a lot about clothes and boys doesn&#8217;t seem like an instant win for Team Bad Rep &#8211; but appearances can be deceptive.</p>
<p>Monique (with the awesome purple hair) is a revolutionary and a style guru, whilst still being a well-rounded character. Proving, if more proof were needed &#8211; and it sometimes is &#8211; that feminism isn&#8217;t about wearing dungarees and being angry all the time. It&#8217;s a thing that people do, to make other people&#8217;s lives better. And it can be light-hearted, well meaning, serious AND funny. With amazing hair.</p>
<p><strong>Sinfest</strong> is written and drawn by <strong>Tatsuya Ishida</strong>, a Japanese American writer/artist who takes pop culture references and uses them to make some really good points about gender politics and <a href="http://www.sinfest.net/archive_page.php?comicID=2966">American consumer culture</a> and mashes them up into a great read. I distinctly remember following the strip more closely than the American election, especially because Sarah Palin Pig made me cry with laughter. The artwork is wonderful, with some lovely bits of line art. He also does some cute dog and cat jokes as well as some <a href="http://www.sinfest.net/archive_page.php?comicID=3411">beautiful calligraphy word-to-shape panels</a>. There really is very little not to like.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve really pulled out all the stops with the recent <a href="http://www.sinfest.net/archive_page.php?comicID=4051">Patriarchy</a> series, which neatly uses the idea of the Matrix to describe living in the &#8220;patriarchy&#8221; &#8211; I&#8217;m going to print out copies and hand them out to anyone who asks what this feminism malarky is all about.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Ah, comics. Or graphic novels if they are trying to seduce me across a pseudy coffee bar in Edinburgh, which they did - more on that later. Dear reader, this is a tale of a long, passionate but fractious love affair.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Team BadRep were put on the spot again this month: in the wake of <a href="http://dcwomenkickingass.tumblr.com/post/7985599811/panels">SDCC Batgirl</a> igniting the gender-and-comics conversation loud &#8216;n&#8217; proud, the team were asked to take a look at their favourite comic book titles and characters &#8211; some obvious choices, some less so&#8230; here&#8217;s Sarah C&#8217;s take.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Ah, comics. Or <em>graphic novels</em>, if they are trying to seduce me across a pseudy coffee bar in Edinburgh, which they did &#8211; more on that later.</p>
<p>Dear reader, this is a tale of a long, passionate, but fractious love affair.</p>
<p>It started early. I noticed them, but they never seemed to be the right one for me, stocked as they were in the &#8220;boys&#8217; section&#8221; of the magazine racks. I kept myself busy with the garish colours of the (probably) gender neutral <a href="http://www.dandy.com/"><strong>Dandy</strong></a> and the <a href="http://www.beano.com/"><strong>Beano</strong></a>. Whilst being amused but ultimately concerned by the levels of naughtiness from <a href="http://www.beano.com/characters/minnie-the-minx">Minnie the Minx</a> (I was a very conscientious child), I found myself captured by a few sections from the pages of hand-me-down copies of the now-defunct &#8220;girls&#8217; own&#8221; annual <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunty"><strong>Bunty</strong></a>. Looking back on it, the artwork was poor and the storylines were hammy with a sprinkling of schmaltz, but some stood out: tales of mystery, adventure, aliens and heroines were hidden amidst the pages of dreary &#8220;girl stuff&#8221;. Now we&#8217;re talking!</p>

<p>Flash forward, and I&#8217;m at university in Edinburgh with actual money in my pocket. I&#8217;ve caught flickers of images in such hallowed sanctuaries as <a href="http://forbiddenplanet.com/">Forbidden Planet</a>, which is exciting but mostly full of plastic models. <a href="http://www.deadheadcomics.co.uk/">Deadhead</a>, lurking on the crooked medieval road across from the pub where I&#8217;ve just earned my actual money, is poky and rammed with paper; pleasingly reminiscment in layout and smell of old bookshops.</p>
<p>On the shelves I spot a beautifully painted (thank you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_Fegredo">Duncan Fegredo</a>) issue of Mike Carey&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer_%28DC_Comics%29"><strong>Lucifer</strong></a>, where a winged schoolgirl escapes the giant maw of a fiery demon; the first of the new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catwoman"><strong>Catwoman</strong></a> where Selina Kyle is resplendent and powerful in a jumpsuit and combat boots; and the gothic lusciousness of Serena Valentino&#8217;s  <a href="http://serenavalentino.com/gloomcookie/"><strong>GloomCookie</strong></a>. <em>And that was just the covers!</em></p>

<p>The stories, oh, oh, oh the stories. Magical, fantastical, intricate and complex tales of all kinds with interesting and varied female characters being just as magical, just as fantastically intricate and complex as their male counterparts.</p>
<p>I am doing my level best to just not list all of them because that would be a little tedious &#8211; check the Wiki articles or better yet come round and read them &#8211; my point is that they were there, and they were<em> so far</em> removed from any other female heroes (or anti-heroes, or villains) that I had ever seen before, and there were just SO MANY of them.</p>
<p>Over the next many years I spent a lot of time and money on comics. I was in love.  Besotted. I compulsively collected every issue of the jaw-dropping <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fables_%28comics%29"><strong>Fables</strong></a> and <a href="http://www.dccomics.com/vertigo/graphic_novels/?gn=1736"><strong>Y: The Last Man</strong></a> (a must for any comic collection). As I tend to be when in love, I was somewhat obsessed. I wrote my dissertation on postmodernist structuralism in Grant Morrison&#8217;s <a href="http://www.barbelith.com/bomb/"><strong>The Invisibles</strong></a> (I know better now, it should have been postmodern superhero archetypes in <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Doom_Patrol:_Crawling_from_the_Wreckage"><strong>Doom Patrol</strong></a>).</p>
<p>I found the most perfect fairy tale ever told in the form of Jeff Smith&#8217;s independent offering <a href="http://www.boneville.com/"><strong>Bone</strong></a>. This is an epic adventure of derring do, lost princesses who need to save the kingdom, war, friendship, quiche and dragons. I cannot recommend it enough.<br />

<p>The character of Grandma Ben blasts away so many female stereotypes. She is mysterious, strong, forthright, takes no nonsense and just plain funny.  She also races cows. As in, races against them. I aim to also do this when I am her age (which she refuses to tell anyone, of course).</p>
<p>But as I read my way through everything that caught my eye, I was spotting a change.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Transmetropolitan_characters#Yelena_Rossini">Filthy Assistant number two</a> Yelena Rossini romped her way through Warren Ellis&#8217; <strong>Transmetropolitan</strong> and stole my heart somewhat with her hard smoking, futuristic gumshoe gonzo journalism and attack womb. Zee Hernandez from Brian Wood&#8217;s spectacular <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMZ_%28comics%29"><strong>DMZ</strong></a> played Beatrice to the lost photographer and guided both him and the reader through a ghastly vision of New York as the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>These women were still good, still interesting, but they were second fiddle, playing traditional (albeit revamped and turbo-boosted) support roles such as healers and helpmeets whilst also filling the &#8220;minority quota&#8221;, especially in the case of Zee who is both non-white and non-male. Naturally all of them end up sleeping with or as love interests for the male protagonists, although at least the storylines of those titles made up for the stereotypes.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the way, it started to go wrong. Bit by bit by bit, even these characters faded away. The series that I loved ended (I cried at the end of <strong>Lucifer</strong>) and were replaced with weaker, less interesting versions. Costumes became smaller, boobs bigger. I started my &#8220;never buy a comic where the cover art has a woman with breasts bigger than her head&#8221; campaign, and found myself wealthier but with a<em> lot less</em> comics.</p>
<p>Female characters and their stories became less widely available. There were still some bright sparks but these were increasingly ghettoised in the narrow &#8220;independent&#8221; section of the store or as part of autobiographical works such as the excellent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persepolis_%28comics%29"><strong>Persepolis</strong></a>. The lack of new work meant that shops began pushing long-standing books like <a href="http://www.strangersinparadise.com/"><strong>Strangers in Paradise</strong></a> or reprints of classics  obviously aimed at women such as <a href="http://dykestowatchoutfor.com/"><strong>Dykes to Watch Out For</strong></a>.</p>
<p>There were still good stories in comic book world, with great artwork, but the women I had come to love had gone missing from the mainstream. Titles such as <strong>Wonder Woman</strong> or <strong>Lady Death</strong> looked like bad pornography, and the artwork for some of my favourite writers became downright ridiculous to the point of offensive. My relationship with comics was getting rocky.</p>
<p>I can pinpoint the exact moment that caused us to break up. It was <a href="http://www.ignitioncity.com/"><strong>Ignition City</strong></a> by Warren Ellis, specifically the way that almost every page had a massive pair of tits or tight (female) bottom in it, regardless of whether that was particularly appropriate or relevant. The male characters, of course, could be as fat, wrinkly, gross, old, multicultural and multidimensional as actual people. The female characters only existed to ensure that there were toned body parts for the consumption of the reader (who obviously wasn&#8217;t meant to be me).</p>
<p>What happened to my love?  What changed? I don&#8217;t know. I have moved to pastures new &#8211; online comics such as <a href="http://www.freakangels.com/"><strong>Freak Angels</strong></a>, <a href="http://www.girlgeniusonline.com/"><strong>Girl Genius</strong></a>, <a href="http://www.sinfest.net/"><strong>Sinfest</strong></a> and <a href="http://xkcd.com/"><strong>XKCD</strong></a> fulfill my panel-related addiction, but every now and then I look longingly at my groaning bookshelf with all those beautiful trade paperbacks, wondering when, if ever, there might be a return to form.</p>
<p>Come back, baby. I miss you.</p>
