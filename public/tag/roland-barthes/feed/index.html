<p>She sez:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;&#8216;Twas a few days before Christmas, and all through the house, not a creature was stirring&#8230; except some fabulous feminist finger puppets. What are they up to now, the little scallywags? (Left to right: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_I_of_England">Good Queen Bess</a>, <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/11/01/an-alphabet-of-femininism-5---e-is-for-emancipate/">Sojourner</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sojourner_Truth">Truth</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_woolf">Virginia Woolf</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frida_Kahlo">Frida Kahlo</a>) I got them as a gift, but they&#8217;re available from <strong><a href="http://www.philosophersguild.com/Puppets/">The Unemployed Philosopher&#8217;s Guild</a></strong>!</li>
<li>On the floor beside my stocking (which was made for me by one of my mum&#8217;s friends I believe, when I was a tiny one) is the second volume of <strong>Linda Medley</strong>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Castle-Waiting-Linda-Medley/dp/1560977477/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1324380494&amp;sr=8-1"><strong>Castle Waiting</strong></a>, a graphic novel series I urgently commend to any feminist fairytale enthusiasts. It&#8217;s explicitly feminist, gentle and genuinely original, with some affectionate jokes at the expense of the fantasy genre, and cracking female characters. Don&#8217;t come expecting Angela Carter style sex &#8216;n&#8217; death fairytale reclamation though. While there is danger lurking, the eponymous castle is a safe haven for the misfit characters.</li>
<li>In the stocking itself is another extremely well-judged gift, a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Love-Worker-Bees-M-Kollontai/dp/0897330013/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1324380571&amp;sr=1-4"><strong>Love of Worker Bees</strong></a> by <strong>Alexandra Kollontai</strong>, published in Russia in 1923. One of the Party faithful, Kollontai explores the tensions between her protagonist&#8217;s dedication to the cause of Socialism and her need for personal autonomy, love and sexual fulfilment. One of the most interesting (and moving) aspects of it is her struggle to reconcile the vision of freedom she passionately believes in with the realities of being a woman after the October Revolution. You&#8217;ll be unsurprised to hear that some are more equal than others.</li>
<li>Next is my trusty copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Misogynies-Joan-Smith/dp/0571139965"><strong>Misogynies</strong></a> by <strong>Joan Smith</strong>, a collection of superb essays on cultural texts which expose the thread of misogyny which runs through the fabric of western culture. A kind of response to Roland Barthes&#8217; famed <strong>Mythologies</strong>, Smith&#8217;s book still has the power to shock, and serves as an excellent eye-opener for those who think it probably isn&#8217;t that bad really. The texts in question may be getting on a bit, but sadly things haven&#8217;t changed all that much.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>Not long now &#8217;til Christmas! Feel free to share what would be in your own feminist Christmas stocking, and have a very BadRep Christmas&#8230;</p>
