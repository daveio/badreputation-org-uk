										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday we posted Part 1 of our interview with anti-cuts activist Roxanne, who told us some pretty unsettling stuff about her experience of being arrested &#8211; <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/10/04/take-it-to-the-bridge-beyond-the-rage-of-the-girl-rioters-part-12">read it here</a>. </p>
<p>On with Part 2, then. </p>
<p><strong>Let&#8217;s talk about UK Uncut as a movement. Do you reckon it&#8217;s pretty equally gender split, and if so, do you reckon acting as a collective helps achieve this more effectively?</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn’t feel confident commenting on the gender split in UK Uncut &#8211; I&#8217;d be referring to tens of thousands of people across the UK. However, in terms of active groups working within the UK, the majority are dominated by white males. But this is why we need to be talking about cuts in terms of gender: to encourage women to join the frontline.</p>

However, it is still true that certain vulnerable groups within society are to be hit in ways that the more privileged may not be. Disabled people are losing their Disability Living Allowance, poorer students have lost the EMA that they and their families rely on, and some women will no longer be able to work because they now have to care for elderly family members or young children. I strongly believe that highlighting the different ways in which the cuts fall should spur people into action, on behalf of themselves or those less able, instead of acting in some divisive way. So what if today we’re standing up against cuts to childcare and you don’t have or want children &#8211; don’t you want to protect those in society who do? </p>
<p>&#8220;These aren’t just issues for women, because protecting women and vulnerable groups is in the interest of the whole of society.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Have you found any women&#8217;s protest movements around the world or in history particularly inspiring?</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;There are so many instances of women’s protest that inspire me consistently. At the moment I’ve been reading about the experiences of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assata_Shakur">Assata Shakur</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Davis">Angela Davis</a>, and find myself inspired by their unrelenting power (and their incredible writing!). </p>
<p>&#8220;I am inspired by the endurance of the women at <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/09/08/revolting-women-greenham-common/">Greenham Common</a>, and the physical strength of the four women who <a href="http://www.cultureshop.org/details.php?code=SEEDS">destroyed a Hawk fighter jet with hammers</a> that was being sold by the British government to East Timor to be used in the government’s illegal occupation of the country. I also recall an image of a row of Zapatista women standing in line with their faces covered but still wearing these incredible bright dresses &#8211; and that image alone inspires me. But closer to home, I am inspired by the women close to me and the support we provide for each other.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>What would your advice be to young women reading our blog who are concerned about the impact of the cuts? Maybe they&#8217;ve never been on a protest before. Perhaps they&#8217;re even a little nervous to start &#8211; do &#8220;clicktivism&#8221; and hashtags and so on make a difference in themselves?</strong></p>

But my advice to anyone nervous to get involved would be that anything that is worth fighting for is going to be a little scary, so that’s even more reason to give it a go. It’s scary because there is so much at stake. The kind of action UK Uncut takes is a great way to get involved. It’s fun and creative and there is always space for people to choose their own style of action, and meet other people who share the same views.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although other types of protest can be effective, I believe that direct action is necessary in any situation where other avenues have been exhausted and shut down. And that is the situation we are in now. For example, the reforms the NHS is facing weren’t in the Conservative or the Lib Dem manifesto, and this coalition government is not even acting on behalf of the majority vote. So how is it fair that these radical changes are being made to a health service that Britain should be so proud of achieving, but is instead determined to destroy, without a say from the public who use it? </p>
<p>&#8220;The leaders in charge of pushing through the bill do not have the population’s interests at heart, are not interested in what we want or what we have to say. But this is our NHS &#8211; we rely on it, and we must protect it.&#8221; </p>
<p><strong>Is it hard for protesters to keep momentum going in the face of these cuts? What&#8217;s next for you? </strong></p>
<p>&#8220;The groups organising actions every week across the country keep momentum going. This issue isn’t going away, the cuts are already being felt, and the fight against them will continue.</p>
<p>&#8220;UK Uncut have just announced the next day of mass action, called <a href="http://www.ukuncut.org.uk/blog/block-the-bridge-block-the-bill"><strong>‘Block the Bridge, Block the Bill’</strong></a> &#8211; 2000 people are already attending on the Facebook event, and hopefully will be showing how serious they are about not losing their National Health Service by transforming Westminster Bridge into hospitals, medical lectures, and a space to share stories about the NHS. </p>
<p>&#8220;On October 12th, the Lords have one last chance to amend the Health and Social Care Bill in Parliament before it is voted on again, and we have one last chance to show that we won’t lose our health service. So join UK Uncut on October 9th and take part in the fight against the cuts!&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So. March For The Alternative hit Manchester&#8217;s Tory Party Conference last weekend, and this weekend there&#8217;s more direct action on the way.</p>
<p>In the era of headlines like <em>RAGE OF THE GIRL RIOTERS</em>, what&#8217;s it like for women on the front line of anti-cuts protesting in the UK right now? Roxanne was at that first sit-in at the London Vodafone flagship store on 27 October 2010 &#8211; out of which <a href="http://www.ukuncut.org.uk/about/ukuncut">a nucleus of energy exploded</a> into the movement we now call <strong>UK Uncut</strong>. </p>

What do you think is the struggle for women in terms of the impact of these cuts? Obviously &#8220;women&#8221; aren&#8217;t a monolithic or homogenous group, but is there a distinct fight?</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;The full scale of the public sector cuts <a href="http://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/index.asp?PageID=1195">fall in a way that is unbalanced in terms of gender</a>. Women make up most of the public sector jobs being cut, women rely most heavily on public services and on certain benefits that are being cut, and where vulnerable people like children, the disabled and the elderly are stripped of their governmental support, it has historically been women that step in to bridge the gap and become carers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The cuts attack services that women depend on in order to live ‘equally’ with men, services that are there to compensate for existing gender inequalities &#8211; Rape Crisis centres and helplines, SureStart and childcare benefits. These are not privileges. Many women rely on these services. Without them, the progress that past generations have made by fighting to get us this far is being unnecessarily sacrificed. The cuts will push us back in time in terms of women’s rights and equality.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don’t believe the struggle is distinct &#8211; this is a fight that everyone should be fighting &#8211; but we should be aware of what we are fighting for and what we, as women, truly stand to lose. The message out there is not clear enough yet – as these cuts fall, they will cut through the progress women have made. </p>
<p>&#8220;The problem is, because of existing sexism within our society and a scepticism towards ‘feminism’, it is still so hard to have conversations about women and the inequality we struggle with. I believe we need more and more great acts of exciting and inviting civil disobedience to get people thinking seriously about gender and the cuts.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Have you found that the police and the media have treated you differently as a female protestor?</strong></p>

Of course. In the most extreme sense, my personal experience of being arrested was interesting in terms of my treatment as a woman. The fact that I am young and female was repeatedly used against me, as a way to make me feel inferior. Of course, that&#8217;s often what the police aim to do with any arrestee; to intimidate and isolate. But after talking to male activists, it seems to me that the treatment is often different if you are a woman in custody. </p>
<p>&#8220;I was arrested by a woman. She commented frequently on my appearance, asking things like, “Do you never brush your hair?” and when I was asked if this was my natural hair colour, she pulled at my roots and answered on my behalf, “No.” A friend of mine was arrested at the same time, and the woman arresting her was even worse. She searched through her backpack, pulled out a pair of underwear and pulled a face like she was disgusted to be holding them. She stretched them out and waved them in the faces of the male officers around, who seemed genuinely embarrassed and uncomfortable at the treatment this woman was giving my friend.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn’t any better when I was in the cell. I was not allowed to use my own tampon, and when I asked for a new one I was told the police station didn’t keep any. I was then given one hours later, which I had to use until I was released after 24 hours. Why don’t police stations have to stock tampons? They have to go out any buy you food if you have special requirements. I was also told I had to be watched closely as I inserted the tampon, which I later found out did not happen to other female activists in different stations. Taking away human rights as basic as this seems like just one more way to reduce an arrestee to a more helpless and regretful position.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>So how did this all get started for you, and is anti-cuts action your first foray into public protest?</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I was involved in environmental activism before UK Uncut, and that is where I learned about the use of direct action as a political tactic. I also learned how to use the consensus model of decision making which empowers each individual to have their say and play an equal part in the movement. These skills have been invaluable to me in every action I have been involved in. </p>
<p>&#8220;I felt that I had to do something to try and stop the government cutting the services that I am most proud of, that society’s most vulnerable people rely on to live in this country. I used to be proud of the structures we had built here to support our population- we built the NHS when we had a bigger deficit than we have today. We should all be proud of such universal services, and we shouldn’t give up the fight and watch as they are all sold off to profit-making companies.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Come back tomorrow for part 2 &#8211; more from Rox, why Block The Bridge should be your next demo, and how to get involved with protesting the cuts. Thanks to Rox for giving us her time.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>That&#8217;s our Revolting Women fest all done and dusted for the moment at least. Obviously there are loads of things we didn&#8217;t manage to cover, but we hope you enjoyed it. </p>
<p>In the meantime, here&#8217;re some relevant links, some of which throw the baton to you. If you&#8217;re feeling like revolting, now&#8217;s the time&#8230; </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://ukuncut.org.uk/blog/block-the-bridge-block-the-bill"><strong>Block The Bridge, Block The Bill, 9th October:</strong></a> &#8220;On Sunday October 9th, join UK Uncut on Westminster Bridge and help block the bill. On one side of Westminster Bridge is Parliament. On 7th September, MPs in the Commons voted for the end of the NHS as we know it. On the opposite side of the bridge is St Thomas’ Hospital, one of Britain’s oldest medical institutions. If the bill passes, hospitals like St Thomas’ will be sold to private corporations, the staff put on private payrolls and beds given over to private patients. Despite the government’s lies, this bill represents the wholesale privatization of the NHS and, with it, the destruction of the dream of comprehensive healthcare provided equally to all. We will not let a coalition of millionaire politicians and private health lobbyists destroy our NHS. Be on Westminster Bridge for 1pm on October 9th and together let’s block this bill from getting to our hospitals.&#8221;
<p>I work at one of the hospitals UKUncut are talking about. It looks no better from the inside. We&#8217;re having our birthday party < 48 hours before (you're totally invited! see below!), but I will be hauling myself out of bed for this. Readers, join Team BadRep as we revolt against both Torygeddon and our inevitable shared hangover in one giant last stand.</li>
<li><a href="http://righttowork.org.uk/2011/09/right-to-work-leaflet-for-the-manchester-tuc-demo-on-2nd-october/#"><strong>TUC March For The Alternative: 2nd October</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://allout.org/en"><strong>All Out:</strong></a> our new favourite campaign. &#8220;We are organizing online and on the ground to build a world where every person can live freely and be embraced for who they are. Gay, lesbian, bi, transgender or straight, we need you to go All Out to build this historic movement for equality.&#8221; The page on Alice N&#8217;Kom, Cameroonian attorney and activist, is particularly inspiring: <a href="http://allout.org/en/actions/cameroon">&#8220;I&#8217;m 66, and in ten years of defending LGBT people in Cameroon, it has never been this bad.&#8221;</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.womankind.org.uk/what-we-do/frequently-asked-questions/overseas-aid-mythbuster/"><strong>WomanKind Worldwide&#8217;s Overseas Aid Mythbuster</strong></a>: &#8220;Print off this page, put it in your bag and next time you hear someone complain about the UK giving money overseas challenge them with the facts.&#8221;</li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.publishersweekly.com/blogs/genreville/?p=1519"><strong>Say Yes to Gay YA:</strong> authors Rachel Manija Brown and Sherwood Smith on young adult fiction and sexuality:</a> &#8220;The overwhelming white straightness of the YA sf and fantasy sections may have little to do with what authors are writing, or even with what editors accept. Perhaps solid manuscripts with LGBTQ protagonists rarely get into mainstream editors’ hands at all, because they are been rejected by agents before the editors see them. How many published novels with a straight white heroine and a lesbian or black or disabled best friend once had those roles reversed, before an agent demanded a change? This does not make for better novels. Nor does it make for a better world.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>COME TO OUR BIRTHDAY PARTY ON OCTOBER 7!</strong> We wanna meet you! <a href="http://badrepuk.eventbrite.com/">Find out more and RSVP here!</a></ul>
