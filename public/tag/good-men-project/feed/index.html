<p>Following on from <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/12/15/alpha-malaise/" title="A link to an
article about masculinity on Bad Reputation - a feminist pop culture adventure">Sarah C&#8217;s blogpost yesterday</a>, I wanted to ask: who decides what it is to &#8220;be a man&#8221;? And why is the answer vital to improving things for women?</p>
<p>This is not just about Alpha Males, but our entire definition of masculinity (and therefore what we&#8217;re telling boys and men they should aim to be). We can talk about being a responsible adult, but how is that different from &#8216;manly&#8217;? </p>
<p>We haven&#8217;t moved on very much from celebrating men as muscle-bound warriors, from equating manliness with <em>physical</em> strength. Nerds are not manly. Thin, &#8216;weak&#8217; guys are not manly. The efficient office worker is not &#8216;manly&#8217;. The patient father is not praised with &#8220;What a man!&#8221; Anyone with the wrong body shape can never qualify.</p>
<p>Manliness also requires independence: you&#8217;re not a successful man if you live in your Mother&#8217;s basement, but men who own motorbikes or fast cars are sexy. It goes beyond this, though. You&#8217;re not manly if you&#8217;re ruled primarily by tender emotions, or &#8220;under the thumb&#8221; of a woman, or &#8211;</p>
<p>Sorry, I just can&#8217;t keep this up. It&#8217;s such utter, utter bullshit. The short answer seems to be: you&#8217;re not a man unless you control your own destiny. If others are in charge of you, or you submit to them, then they are above you on the Manliness Scale.</p>
<p>And we wonder why the entire planet is in danger.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s as though the capability to fight and take &#8211; and therefore provide &#8211; is still the only measure of what makes a man. Male aggression is not popular in modern society (outside of sports, boardrooms and the army) but Sarah C referred to some websites yesterday which celebrate a particularly horrible version of poisonous alpha male tropes. Their vision consists of controlling your women (multiple), being in command, being admired for being powerful, and taking it easy while your slaves do the work because you&#8217;re the big man.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty strange to see that this still exists in an allegedly modern country. These men seem to think they can be less powerless in life if they take imagined power from women around them. A big part of it lies in succeeding specifically <em>because</em> you have lowered a woman&#8217;s power from a perceived higher place. Femininity is seen as making men weak, and women are assumed to be always less powerful (making any example of them EVER overruling the alpha an unacceptable demonstration of the alpha&#8217;s weakness.)</p>
<p>So why is this commanding behaviour not only acceptable, respected, sought-after, but the definition of masculine prowess?</p>
<p>Some sources believe it&#8217;s because <a href="http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2010/09/when_was_the_last_time_you_got.html">fighting is the one thing you can&#8217;t fake.</a> It&#8217;s also the action which overrules all others: it doesn&#8217;t matter how deserving, wise or honourable you are, someone with a bigger gun can take it all away. So maybe it&#8217;s about security, and therefore defence of loved ones, rather than the more pessimistic approach of valuing someone primarily for their ability to attack.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s interesting is that this Conan image comes more from the media and movies than reality. A quick poll of some female friends found that they mainly think &#8220;manly&#8221; means having <em>Values, Character, Responsibility</em>&#8230; behaviours which suggest you are not just a boy in adult clothes. The change is from a child to an adult, not to being more <em>male</em> than before.</p>
<p>But the images and lessons boys receive from TV and cinema simply cannot equate maturity with manliness unless the man can also kick the ass of everyone onscreen. And be totally 100% heterosexual, of course. (In the same poll, one woman said she&#8217;d think less of a man if he wasn&#8217;t physically stronger than her, so it&#8217;s not all one-sided.) Even here, &#8216;feminine&#8217; qualities are seen as taking away from a man&#8217;s masculinity. And since &#8216;feminine&#8217; is deemed inseparable from a woman&#8217;s perfect role of being a (usually married) mother, that means men are deemed less manly if they show any nurturing behaviour towards kids, are emotionally sensitive, etc etc oh god this is depressing.</p>
<p>Ultimately, masculinity is bound up with <em>individual</em> heroism instead of having to rely on others, and that&#8217;s a dangerous place to be.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a sad trend for feminism that men are judged on what they <strong>do</strong>, and women are judged on how they <strong>look</strong>, but the male side of that is not as enabling as it appears. The target for masculinity has to include muscle, mastery and money. A man’s worth (as a &#8220;successful&#8221; male and especially as relationship material) is very closely linked to his money. Not just the prestige of the job, but how far up the status ladder of it he is. Success and potential future success are what are really being measured, in whatever field. And it IS about wealth; that&#8217;s why status <em>symbols</em> work. They represent the money, and therefore the power, or his capability and drive to get power.</p>
<p>Who are the male role models on TV? Bling-laden hard men rappers surrounded by girls, secret agents who win every fight, footballers and movie stars. All of whom are alpha males who get the girls and status (and money). Individual parents might offer better role models linked to how to be manly, but &#8220;society&#8221; doesn&#8217;t. Even the &#8220;lad&#8217;s mags&#8221; of the 1990s like <strong>FHM</strong> and <strong>Loaded</strong> <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/press/why-are-mens-magazines-being-left-on-the-shelf-2142714.html">aren&#8217;t connecting with what men feel is right for their lives</a>.</p>
<p>Despite all this, the problem is nothing compared to what women face when society tells them what it thinks &#8216;feminine&#8217; is. That still must include sexual issues in a way that &#8216;masculine&#8217; doesn&#8217;t, as well as passivity/submission. And for all the harm that men feeling unneeded may bring, reclaiming feminism from its Bad Rep is a more urgent issue &#8211; <strong>but it&#8217;s not unrelated</strong>. We need ways for men to behave better towards women without feeling less masculine. The strict mandate to never appear as &#8216;weak&#8217; as a woman is <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/1031">a foundation of male violence</a>.</p>
<p>The message needs to change. We need to be saying that a man is valued if he behaves <em>well</em>, with compassion and thought and honour. The only medium that counts in bringing messages like this to the public is television, and that&#8217;s why pop culture is so crucial. Less &#8216;lone white male avenger&#8217; shows, more balanced, nuanced depictions of heroism. We won&#8217;t get it from retail advertisers (who want you to believe you need money, items and to be having constant fun or you are a failure). We need it to come from pop culture, and to reach children and young adults in ways which seem natural and obvious.</p>
<p>There is hope. As well as the attitudes of real individuals in the surveys I mentioned earlier, some websites and magazines are also looking at the problem. One very interesting example is <a href="http://goodmenproject.com/">The Good Men Project</a>, which launched recently. They seem to be asking precisely the same question I have: what&#8217;s the difference between &#8220;being a man&#8221; and &#8220;being a GOOD man&#8221;? And why is there such a huge potential difference at all? (Also: high-five to that site for genuinely exploring how to get comfortable with masculinity in a way which benefits the individual and society, and so far not setting up feminism as any kind of block to that.)<sup><a href="/2010/12/16/big-dog/#footnote_0_82" id="identifier_0_82" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" Ed&rsquo;s Tiny Note, Added In 2013: It would seem The Good Men Project has since made quite the effort to distance itself from feminists, and has had more of its fair share of problematic moments.

<p>While men are told that compromising, accepting help or having anything in common with a woman makes them weak, everyone needs this harmful definition of masculinity to change.</p>

<li>It&#8217;s the <strong>Twelfth Annual International Transgender Day of Remembrance</strong> on 20th November. There&#8217;s an event in Brighton on Sunday 21st November.  <a href="http://www.transgenderdor.org/">Read more about events around the world, and what the day itself is all about, here</a>. In brief, it&#8217;s an event to remember everyone who has died this year as a result of widespread prejudice against genderqueer and transpeople.  The list is deeply saddening. Some of the BR team will be going to the Brighton event, and hopefully there will be lots of people there.</li>
<li>Gabby Schulz: comic on <a href="http://www.gabbysplayhouse.com/?p=1444">sexism and online etiquette.</a> (Invoked debate to the tune of <em>666 </em>comments!)</li>
<li>It would be churlish at this point not to link to Kate Beaton&#8217;s <a href="http://harkavagrant.com/">Hark! A Vagrant</a>, which if you haven&#8217;t checked out before, you should.  You may well be aware of it already, but it bears repeating, because when I first discovered it, I cheered at my monitor screen with the kind of excitement I&#8217;d not exhibited since about 1994 when Terry Deary&#8217;s <em>Horrible Histories</em> were my favourite buys at the school Book Fair.<em> </em> Contains Susan B Anthony, Wonder Woman, Tesla, mermaids, and the Brides of Dracula supporting universal suffrage.</li>
<li><a href="http://dontinterrupt.tumblr.com/">Don&#8217;t Interrupt</a> &#8211; Lizzie B blogs &#8220;work, politics, the media and being a woman.  So just about everything, except, of course, the kitchen sink&#8221;. Nice.</li>
<li>This blog was featured recently in Marie Claire magazine, no less, and frankly, you can&#8217;t knock their taste on this one bit: <a href="http://velvetcoalmine.wordpress.com/">Rhian Jones on Velvet Coalmine blogs music and politics.</a></li>
<li>Here&#8217;re some blogs aiming to engage male readers with gender issues and/or feminism: <a href="http://mendaredo.com/">What Men Dare Do</a>, <a href="http://feministallies.blogspot.com/">Feminist Allies</a>, and <a href="http://goodmenproject.com/">The Good Men Project</a>.</li>
