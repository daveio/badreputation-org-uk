<p><strong>CONTENT NOTE:</strong> Discussions herein of sexual assault, dubious consent, mental health treated badly, homophobia, biphobia and slut-shaming. Oh, and plenty of spoilers.</p>
<p>Welcome back to <strong>Hopeless Reimantic Presents</strong>! <a href="/2013/12/04/hopeless-reimantic-presents-anita-blake-vampire-hunter-part-one" target="_blank">Last time we got our teeth into <strong>Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter</strong></a>, and I found myself actually saying some pretty positive things about the books. (Honestly, I&#8217;m as surprised as you. My fourteen-year-old self is throwing one hell of a sulk.) It&#8217;s not the full story, though, and there&#8217;s still quite a lot about this series to unpack.</p>
<p>First of all, there&#8217;s something I need to make clear: as I said in <a href="/2013/12/04/hopeless-reimantic-presents-anita-blake-vampire-hunter-part-one" target="_blank">Part One</a>, I went into this review determined not to talk about the series in relation to Laurell K. Hamilton herself more than was necessary.</p>
<p>I generally hold that unless an author has done something that I can&#8217;t reconcile myself to morally, I don&#8217;t feel like it&#8217;s my business to talk about their personal life when I am supposed to be reviewing their books. And from what I&#8217;ve read of Laurell K. Hamilton&#8217;s blog posts, she seems kind of entitled and I find her annoying, but&#8230;well, let&#8217;s just say that as far as I can tell she&#8217;s no Orson Scott Card. By and large my problems with the ideas she puts across can easily be expressed in criticism of her work rather than criticism of her.</p>
<p>I ran into some problems with this approach, to be sure; the evidence for Anita Blake being the author&#8217;s avatar is pretty compelling. But for the purposes of analysing the text, I&#8217;m putting that debate to bed. From here on out, guys, they&#8217;re just books, so if anyone is reading this expecting it to be a catalogue of Ms Hamilton&#8217;s character flaws, well, it&#8217;s not going to be. Hashtag sorry not sorry, or something.</p>
<p>Oh, one more thing: I&#8217;m limiting myself to a maximum of one book quotation per point here, because SEVENTEEN BOOKS LORD HAVE MERCY.</p>
<p>Okay! Let&#8217;s get started. Where were we? Was I wanting to tear my eyes out? I think I was wanting to tear my eyes out.</p>
<p>&#8230;I&#8217;m going to need to slip into a more concise format, I think, or that&#8217;s just going to be the entire article. Here, then, in no particular order, are My Main Problems with Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter:</p>
<h3>1) Anita only has one dating experience that I would describe as fully consensual.</h3>
<p>She dates Richard, a werewolf, and then she gets engaged to Richard, and <em>then</em> the vampire she&#8217;s been hanging out with decides that he needs &#8220;equal time&#8221; to win her over, or he&#8217;s got no choice but to duel Richard to the death:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;You have dated him for months, and I have said little. Before you marry him, I want equal time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been trying to avoid you for months. I&#8217;m not just going to give in now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I will start the music, and we will dance. Even if I die, and you die. Richard will die first, I can promise you that. Surely dating me is not a fate worse than death.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8211; Laurell K. Hamilton, <strong>The Lunatic Cafe</strong>, p.221.</p></blockquote>
<p>(I&#8217;m not so sure about that, dude.)</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also the shapeshifter leopard who basically just rapes her (it&#8217;s okay, she enjoys it) and then is her mate and it&#8217;s all fine, and the other shapeshifter leopard who is Terrifyingly Submissive at her until she gives in (more on that later). These are her four main men and, last I checked, the various loves of her life.</p>
<p>There are a couple of things at play here, and I can intellectually grasp them both. One is that an easy way to add darkness and tension to a story is to have your main character interact with a world which doesn&#8217;t recognise their morality, which is how we get all those kind of racist &#8220;I was ravished by a barbarian/sheikh/otherwise rich and dark-skinned man&#8221; stories (remind me to talk to you about <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2180276.The_Panther_and_the_Pearl" target="_blank"><strong>The Panther And The Pearl</strong></a> some time). And that&#8217;s not necessarily a bad thing in a fantasy world where you are dealing with beings that might have witnessed the greater part of human history. I do take the point that you might well not care so much about pesky human morals when you&#8217;ve been living off blood or sex or male tears or whatever for about a thousand years.</p>
<p>And, credit where it&#8217;s due, Laurell K. Hamilton does make some effort to deal with the effect this is having on Anita; she agonises, at least initially, over the detachment she feels from her humanity as she gets drawn deeper into the preternatural world. Hamilton doesn&#8217;t really take that conflict anywhere, which is a shame because it makes the whole thing feel a bit too insta-conflict for my liking, but she tries.</p>
<p>The considerably more disturbing thing is the second point, which is that this is supposed to be <em>hot</em>. We&#8217;ve touched on this before in <a href="/2013/04/23/hopeless-reimantic-3-pack-mentality/" target="_blank">the column on alpha males</a>, but one thing that I think I missed there is actually what I find grossest about this particular fantasy &#8211; that being threatened or coerced, either physically or by other means, into being with someone is supposed to be evidence of part of a woman&#8217;s power and mystique. It&#8217;s not that these guys are proto-rapists, no &#8211; it&#8217;s that women are so damned irresistible that they overwhelm men&#8217;s judgement and common sense. Basically, they are the full moon to every man&#8217;s <a href="http://pervocracy.blogspot.co.uk/2012/08/the-myth-of-boner-werewolf.html" target="_blank">boner werewolf</a> (link NSFW).</p>
<p>There is an element of pick-up artistry that states that when you overcome LMR (last minute resistance, usually to sex) you&#8217;re actually doing the woman a favour, because you&#8217;re taking the responsibility out of her hands. She can&#8217;t be a slut, because she&#8217;s not in control; you&#8217;re preserving her purity while still giving her the sex she wants. That is gross and messed-up and a terrible bit of rape apologia, but it&#8217;s the same kind of logic that I&#8217;m seeing here; it&#8217;s a way to skirt around having Anita own her own sexuality. She can&#8217;t help it! She&#8217;s just got this <em>energy</em>!</p>
<p>And on that note&#8230;</p>
<h3>2) There&#8217;s hella slut-shaming.</h3>
<p>It took me a while to realise this. I started out with <strong>Danse Macabre</strong>, but the more of these books I read, the more I became convinced that having lots of sex was only okay for Anita Blake, and by extension her harem of men, because Anita Blake has sex because she somehow <em>has</em> to &#8211; which is a pretty icky sentence to begin with, by the way. </p>
<p>Anita starts out the series not believing in pre-marital sex. She ends up having quite a lot of it, but there&#8217;s never a sense that she revises that belief, which would be really interesting if it didn&#8217;t have such weird implications for the other women in the books. Anita has sex because of deep love, a deep sense of obligation (erk) and/or because she is a succubus. Metaphysical events or very strong emotion compel her to bone, and the fact that she ends up enjoying it immensely is somehow a coincidence, which is possibly the strangest permutation of the forced seduction trope I&#8217;ve ever seen. </p>
<p>And even that would be okay, were it not for the fact that every single other woman in the books who has sex for such a frivolous reason as the fact she just enjoys it is painted as either a) shallow and heinous, b) mentally unstable, or c) both.</p>
<p>Which brings me neatly to:</p>
<h3>3) There is gratuitous use of mental illness as a plot device.</h3>
<p>Basically every villain is crazy. And there&#8217;s Nathaniel, her second shapeshifter love interest, who is super-submissive and utterly traumatised by his past and hey, did we mention he&#8217;s kinky too and can take more pain than anybody else? Because he&#8217;s damaged?</p>
<p>Urgh. If I had to hazard, I&#8217;d say this follows a lot of the same logic that we see in point 1), but let&#8217;s just be honest here; this isn&#8217;t just offensive, it&#8217;s lazy writing, in the same way that blaming serious criminal offences or terrorism on mental illness is lazy journalism. It&#8217;s a way to avoid grappling seriously with what could actually be some pretty compelling issues and it&#8217;s depressing me. So let&#8217;s move on to our final point:</p>
<h3>4) Gender essentialism and homophobia.</h3>
<p>Hoo boy.</p>
<p>This is a pretty interesting one, actually, because the characters around Anita Blake actually call her on some of it, and it doesn&#8217;t work. I skipped a quotation for mental illness and point 2, so we can have two in here because it&#8217;s my column and I make the rules.</p>
<p>I feel like I need to include this one because it&#8217;s in <strong>Shutdown</strong>, which was actually only released <a href="http://www.laurellkhamilton.org/2013/10/shutdown-press-release/" target="_blank">a few weeks ago</a> &#8211; and, again, in fairness to Ms Hamilton, releasing it the way she did was a nice idea (it was a freebie because of the US government shutdown, in solidarity with government workers who were off without pay). </p>
<p>The story itself is interesting purely because the premise is so flawed: Richard, Anita Blake&#8217;s erstwhile lover, now-Top, is engaged to another woman, and apparently has chosen only now to mention to her that he&#8217;s poly and wants to see other people for wild kinky sex. His fiancee has a problem with this &#8211; not, you understand, because somehow <em>they have got as far as being engaged without this ever having come up</em>, but because she&#8217;s a crazy jealous harpy who can&#8217;t wrap her narrow mind around non-monogamy or sex that isn&#8217;t vanilla. </p>
<p>I liked precisely nobody in this short, but Anita least of all:</p>
<blockquote><p>I hadn&#8217;t had to endure this much small talk in years. We&#8217;d learned a lot about one another, but unless we were looking to date, I didn&#8217;t see the point.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Men understood that sometimes you didn&#8217;t want to smile, but you weren&#8217;t mad either, while women expect other women to be pleasant, and if you&#8217;re not they think you don&#8217;t like them. There are so many reasons that most of my friends are men. </p>
<p>&#8211; Laurell K. Hamilton, <strong>Shutdown</strong>, pp.6-8</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh, Ms Blake, you charmer. I could quote this little piece all day, actually, because it shows you a lot about the mess of contradictions that is gender portrayal in these books, but &#8211; you guys, I can&#8217;t. I just can&#8217;t. I think my brain is leaking out of my ears.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s finish up, then, with one final quote, and my witty and insightful riposte.</p>
<p>Look, okay, this isn&#8217;t even close to the most homophobia I&#8217;ve ever seen in fiction, or the worst. I&#8217;ll give you that I really do think this was&#8230; misguided, but well-intentioned. For what that&#8217;s worth. But the fact remains that I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve seen a non-heterosexual character in the Anita Blake series who wasn&#8217;t sex-obsessed, mentally ill (see above) and/or just plain old mean. </p>
<p>Anita Blake herself later gets a girlfriend and starts identifying as &#8220;heteroflexible&#8221;, which is a completely valid label that I don&#8217;t wish to detract from, but in this case reads to me sort of like she&#8217;s just started adding &#8220;no homo&#8221; to the end of all of her sentences about fancying women.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s&#8230;well, this. For context: some of Anita&#8217;s male partners are bisexual. She has just had a threesome with one of them and another man, which she feels gives her incontrovertible proof that he is, in fact, also into guys. The other men around her do not seem bothered by this revelation. Which prompts the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In college I had a friend, a girlfriend, a girl who was a friend. She and I went shopping together. Slept over at each other&#8217;s dorm rooms. I undressed in front of her because she was a girl. Then toward the end of college she told me she was gay. We were still friends, but she went into that guy category for me. You don&#8217;t undress in front of people who see you as a sex object. You don&#8217;t sleep with them, or&#8230;oh, hell.&#8221; I looked up at Micah. &#8220;Won&#8217;t it weird you out to sleep nude beside him now?&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8211; Laurell K. Hamilton, <strong>Danse Macabre</strong>, p.188.</p></blockquote>
<p>Funny story: my original response to this paragraph was a lot more colourful. I&#8217;m going to try and discuss it briefly, coherently and without expletives.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure which bothers me more, here: the idea that being attracted to members of one gender means you&#8217;re attracted to <em>all</em> members of one gender, or Anita&#8217;s assumption that everybody around her is going to have the same weird hang-ups as she is. I will say, though, that reading this made me briefly see red. You can come hang out with my friends, Anita Blake&#8217;s token lesbian college friend! They&#8217;ll hug you! Even the straight women!</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m struggling to articulate is why, exactly, this paragraph was the exact point that I fully lost patience with the series, because in context it&#8217;s not actually so bad. Anita is laughed at for her small-mindedness, and they all go to sleep naked and it&#8217;s fine.</p>
<p>Except&#8230;</p>
<p>Except that <em>this never really goes away</em>. There&#8217;s a kind of false normal here that you&#8217;re not supposed to stray from, and then even when Anita does, all that happens it that it gets this veneer of &#8220;exotic sexy sex stuff&#8221; that makes the books transgressive and naughty. It doesn&#8217;t read like a straight-up sex fantasy. I definitely don&#8217;t buy that it&#8217;s an honest exploration of sexuality in fiction. I&#8217;m not even sure that it&#8217;s Laurell K. Hamilton bragging about her sex life with extra fantasy elements.</p>
<p>The best way I can describe it is that it reads like a zoo exhibit, if people who have a lot of sex could actually literally <em>be</em> zoo exhibits. It doesn&#8217;t challenge normative attitudes, is what I&#8217;m saying. It takes the stuff Ms Hamilton describes as &#8220;too underground for the mainstream&#8221; and sticks it behind a thick layer of societal assumptions-reinforced glass, so that you can look at it without getting your brain too into all the sex stuff. And then you can go home at the end feeling like you&#8217;ve learned something. And perhaps a little icky.</p>
<p>And that brings us to the end of <strong>Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter</strong>. If you enjoyed this column and want me to do more like it, consider dropping me a comment, because the experience was&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;it was&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;it&#8217;s been an experience, guys. And now, if you&#8217;ll excuse me, I&#8217;m off to read something else. Something gentle, with no sex in it whatsoever. Maybe some Catherynne M. Valente.</p>
<p>See you next time!</p>

<li><em>Here&#8217;s Part 2 of <a href="http://www.rarelywearslipstick.com">Rarely Wears Lipstick</a> founder and blogger <strong>Lori Smith</strong>&#8216;s guest post two-parter (which is possibly mildly NSFW depending on how relaxed your workplace is!) <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2013/03/26/guest-post-lingerie-women-and-eroticism-a-brief-study-of-the-21st-century-agent-provocateur-woman-part-12/">Read Part 1 here</a>.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>Part 2: The Myth of the Agent Provocateur Woman</h2>
<p>If it is understood that the dominant discourse still pertains to heterosexual and patriarchal ideologies, Agent Provocateur was certainly aiming to challenge this in 2008. The brochure for their Spring/Summer collection that year contains many examples of non-heteronormative behaviour.</p>
<p>A model in a swimming costume and stilettos <a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AP2.jpg?resize=547%2C410" target="_blank">stands in front of a seated, similarly attired woman</a>, who touches her leg and looks up to her. Two women in satin lingerie and high heels are seen walking together – one has her hand on the other’s buttocks. A woman in animal print lingerie brandishes a spanking paddle and leans over an anonymous prostrate naked woman, whilst holding a rope that is attached to the submissive woman’s neck like a leash. An anonymous red-haired woman straddles a seated gasping woman whose arm is being stroked by a blonde in lingerie, brandishing a riding crop. Another woman, who is standing with her legs apart and her hands on her hips, watches an athletic female pole dancer. A topless woman in a red wig climbs on top of a woman in lingerie who lies, restrained, on a table.</p>
<p>There are also many examples of dominant female behaviour. Two women in bright coloured wigs and lingerie tie up and blindfold a clothed man on his knees. A man in underwear stands, with hands tied behind his back, displaying marks on his chest that suggest he has been struck by the riding crop held by the woman to his left. A handcuffed man is disrobed by a woman, whilst another woman records the scene using a professional video camera. A man lying restrained on a table, has his trousers unzipped by a lingerie-clad woman who is holding a glass of brandy and is staring directly at the viewer.</p>

<p>In this image, the Agent Provocateur woman is powerful yet playful. She is passionate, determined to satisfy her own desires and, from the facial expressions depicted, is clearly enjoying herself. She is active, not passive, and has agency.</p>
<p>However, in the 2012 brochure, the Agent Provocateur woman appears to have little or no agency. She faces the camera as if directed to by the photographer and is entirely the subject of the gaze – continually watching herself. This appears to be a return to the woman John Berger describes in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ways_of_Seeing" target="_blank"><strong>Ways of Seeing</strong></a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>She has to survey everything she is and everything she does because how she appears to others, and ultimately how she appears to men, is of crucial importance for what is normally thought of as the success of her life.</p></blockquote>
<p>There is little or no resistance to dominant discourses in the images contained within this brochure. All of the women appear sexually available, but are inviting sex rather than pursuing it. A woman stands in lingerie and heels next to a similarly attired seated woman, both facing the viewer with their legs apart. A woman kneels on a velvet chair, glancing over her shoulder at the viewer, with her buttocks prominently displayed. A woman in lingerie reclines on a chaise longue. A seated woman with her legs apart, hand on hip, stares at the viewer. There is no interaction between these women, even when more than one appears in the same image. Their only purpose is to invite the viewer’s gaze.</p>

<p><a href="http://joc.sagepub.com/content/6/2/177.abstract" target="_blank">Christian Jantzen and others</a> conducted a series of interviews with white middle class women in Denmark. The results suggested that these women wear delicate lingerie in order to achieve a sensation rather than a look. They wear it for how it makes them feel – confident, sensual, happy and satisfied – not necessarily for how they will be perceived by their partner. Some of the interviewees even admitted that the men in their lives do not understand their desire for exquisite lingerie. For them, the purchase and wearing of beautiful expensive underwear is about much more than just sex. It is about identity, pleasure, knowing how to dress for the right occasion, and, occasionally, projecting a desired alternate self-image:</p>
<blockquote><p>The importance of lingerie to most of our respondents is due to the fact that this kind of garment enables them to demonstrate that they can manage a modern femininity. By adhering to a certain scheme of classification, they show how they master their performance in different situations. This confirms their <em>social self</em>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Their research suggests that presenting lingerie as something to be enjoyed by the viewer rather than the wearer would not appeal to women. Even if this is not always true of women outside of their small study sample, I would argue that the current representation of the Agent Provocateur woman would therefore not appeal to the customer the brand originally sought to attract.</p>
<p>To conclude, the Agent Provocateur woman’s identity is, like the identity of every woman, shaped by discourse and the ideologies she is exposed to. If the woman is surrounded by, and part of, discourse which challenges what is currently dominant, she will herself become part of a reverse discourse. Agent Provocateur was originally conceived by Corré and Rees as a celebration of femininity, and the initial representation of the Agent Provocateur woman emphasised the performativity of her gender and her rejection of the patriarchal ideologies so often present in lingerie advertising.</p>
<p>Although the association between Agent Provocateur lingerie and this playfully erotic yet not passive lifestyle is purely arbitrary, it was exceedingly easy for customers to see the brand’s values and decide whether or not they wished to adopt them. Through the act of putting on this particular brand of quality exotic lingerie, a customer would create her sense of self, create her gender and transform her life into that of the Agent Provocateur woman. All of this was successfully conveyed in the promotional images and advertising for the brand up until at least 2008.</p>
<p>In looking at the differences between the images used to promote the Spring/Summer 2008 collection and those of the Autumn/Winter 2012 collection, it could be argued that the sale of the brand to a multinational company had an effect on how the Agent Provocateur woman was represented. The brand’s ideal woman appears to now offer far less resistance to current discourses on gender, sexuality and femininity than she did when Corré and Rees first sought to use lingerie as a way to disrupt and question the fashion status quo.</p>
<p>In expanding the market for the brand, the new owners appear to be attempting to create erotic lingerie that does not offend, thus diluting the original ethos of Agent Provocateur. Perhaps it is the current discourse which has changed, or maybe the Agent Provocateur woman simply works with the current discourse rather than against it? However, it could also be claimed that what is considered to be erotic is entirely subjective.</p>

<li><em>Having had an awesome time at the <a href="http://www.rarelywearslipstick.com/2013/03/rwl-awards-the-winners/" target="_blank">Rarely Wears Lipstick Awards</a>, in which we were nominated for Best Feminist Blog (and congrats to <a href="http://stavvers.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Stavvers</a>, the fabulous winner!) we are very happy to have RWL founder and blogger <strong>Lori Smith</strong> back to BadRep Towers for a two-parter (which is possibly NSFW depending on how relaxed your workplace is! Maybe skip the vid)&#8230;</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>Part 1: Agent Provocateur, Discourse and Performativity</h2>
<p>In 1971, Vivienne Westwood and Malcolm McLaren set up ‘Let it Rock’, their first King’s Road boutique. Their son Joseph Corré followed in his parents’ footsteps and opened a shop in London with his wife Serena Rees in 1994. Named <a href="http://www.agentprovocateur.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Agent Provocateur</strong></a>, the unusual boutique bridged a gap between the erotic lingerie sold in Soho’s sex shops and the respectable prettiness of the established quality brands sold in department stores.</p>
<p>Corré and Rees saw the brand as a vehicle for their creativity and their ideas about women and femininity. In 1995, they began a search for a woman who ‘would represent the concepts behind the clothes, model new designs, and be a spokesperson at upcoming events’. They saw the face of their brand as ‘charming, glamorous, curvy, independent and intelligent’ (see <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Agent-Provocateur-Celebration-Femininity-Sexuality/dp/1858687586" target="_blank"><strong>Agent Provocateur: A Celebration of Femininity</strong></a>).</p>
<p>The finalists of their competition were used as part of a publicity stunt at London Fashion Week, staging a demonstration against bland passionless fashion that drew the attention of the assembled press. After a decadent Miss Agent Provocateur Party had been held, where the winner was announced, Corré and Rees realised that a single woman couldn’t represent their brand’s values as the concept was too diverse. Every woman has the potential to become an agent provocateur.<br />
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AP1.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="13386" data-permalink="/2013/03/26/guest-post-lingerie-women-and-eroticism-a-brief-study-of-the-21st-century-agent-provocateur-woman-part-12/ap1/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AP1.jpg?fit=912%2C684&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="912,684" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="AP1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AP1.jpg?fit=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AP1.jpg?fit=912%2C684&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-13386 aligncenter" alt="Agent Provocateur invitation brochure page" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AP1.jpg?resize=438%2C328" width="438" height="328" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Corré and Rees have since divorced, and in 2007, Agent Provocateur was purchased by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3i" target="_blank">3i Group</a>. This gradually led to a significant change in how the Agent Provocateur woman was represented in the brand’s advertising campaigns. The brochure to showcase the Spring/Summer 2008 collection retained a lot of the ethos of Corré and Rees’ original vision. It has a cover designed to look like an invitation to an exclusive party, featuring the text ‘you are cordially invited to attend a very private affair […] Bring a blindfold and an open mind!’. Each image inside forms part of a digitally-created montage, with the pages containing small parts of the panoramic whole, unfolding to reveal one uninterrupted tableau.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AP2.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="13390" data-permalink="/2013/03/26/guest-post-lingerie-women-and-eroticism-a-brief-study-of-the-21st-century-agent-provocateur-woman-part-12/ap2/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AP2.jpg?fit=912%2C684&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="912,684" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="AP2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AP2.jpg?fit=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AP2.jpg?fit=912%2C684&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-13390 aligncenter" alt="Shot of models at party for AP brochure." src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AP2.jpg?resize=547%2C410" width="547" height="410" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>The models are depicted as attendees of the party and are engaging in activities of a sexual nature. Nothing pornographic is depicted, merely hints of erotic and light BDSM play. Most of the party guests are women, clothed in Agent Provocateur lingerie and swimwear, but there are also a number of men in the image. The women take both dominant and submissive roles, whilst the men are purely submissive.</p>

<p>Product information about the lingerie sets featured, such as name and price, is listed on the back of the image. With this choice of layout, it could be argued that the images are designed to be enjoyed first, and to be informative second.</p>

<p>By contrast, the Autumn/Winter 2012 collection is presented in a brochure containing separate images for each named set of lingerie, with the product details directly underneath each photograph. The theme of the collection is ‘Wilhelmina: Show Your True Self’ and the associated campaign focuses on a woman in Victorian London whose inner sensuality is revealed by a backstreet photographer’s magical camera.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/7DY728GDWI0" height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Each image contains between one and three female models, with little or no interaction between them. The women are not engaged in any activity other than modelling the clothing for the viewer, and are, as such, passive subjects of the gaze. Hair and make up is consistent throughout and maintains the look of a catwalk show, where the models are presented as a homogenous entity – a representation of how the brand’s woman should physically embody that season’s look.</p>

<p>Each model’s &#8216;true self&#8217; appears to be no different from the others. This presents us with a single type of Agent Provocateur woman, as opposed to the idea that she is present in all women, as Corré envisioned seventeen years previously.</p>

<p>It has often been suggested that the female body in lingerie is more erotic than the nude female body. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_Barthes" target="_blank">Roland Barthes</a> touches on this in his essay on striptease, published in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythologies_(book)" target="_blank"><strong>Mythologies</strong></a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Woman is desexualized at the very moment when she is stripped naked. We may therefore say that we are dealing in a sense with a spectacle based on fear, or rather on the pretence of fear, as if eroticism here went no further than a sort of delicious terror, whose ritual signs have only to be announced to evoke at once the idea of sex and its conjuration.</p></blockquote>
<p>At the very heart of the original concept of the Agent Provocateur brand, when it was founded by Corré and Rees, was the idea of lingerie as a ritual sign which evoked the idea of sex. Although they sought to design underwear which referenced socially acceptable quality French lingerie, eroticism was very much a part of Agent Provocateur’s core values. They made the brand accessible to women who would not normally venture into sex shops to purchase erotic lingerie.</p>
<p>It could be argued that Corré and Rees were also responding to dominant discourse on sexuality and gender when they set up Agent Provocateur in the 1990s. In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_History_of_Sexuality#Volume_I:_The_Will_to_Knowledge" target="_blank"><strong>The History of Sexuality Volume 1</strong></a>, Michel Foucault analyses changes in discourse on sexuality and argues that discourse is a productive force; for example, leading to definitions of “normal” and “other”. He also looks at the concept of docile bodies versus active agency, discussing reverse discourse as an empowering method of countering the dominant discourse.</p>
<p>There is little doubt that Agent Provocateur – whose name refers to an undercover agent employed to provoke suspects to commit illegal punishable acts – originally sought to engage in a reverse discourse on female sexuality. In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_History_of_Sexuality#Part_II:_The_Repressive_Hypothesis" target="_blank"><strong>The History of Sexuality Volume 2</strong></a>, Foucault delves further and discusses what he calls ‘techniques of the self’, emphasising the role of practices and instruments in generating a sense of self.</p>
<p>Clothing is very much a ‘technique of the self’. People use their clothes to transform, change and project a chosen image on a daily basis. Although society still often restricts the individual’s choice of outerwear, <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/12/19/found-feminism-agent-provocateur-the-chase/" target="_blank">unseen underwear</a> offers the wearer a sense of agency. Lingerie is considered by many to be an instrument in generating a sense of self, and it is worth considering here that the self is also shaped by gender.</p>
<p>It is widely understood that gender is a cultural construction that is shaped by discursive forces. One of the main issues considered by Judith Butler is the performativity of gender. Gender is not a performance – as that suggests the performer returns to a more genuine self once they leave the stage – but it is performative, as we are all constantly putting on an act. Lingerie is but one aspect of the act of femininity.</p>
<blockquote><p>Because there is neither an “essence” that gender expresses or externalizes nor an objective ideal to which gender aspires, and because gender is not a fact, the various acts of gender create the idea of gender, and without those acts, there would be no gender at all.</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>Judith Butler</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Therefore, what could possibly be more “womanly” than dressing oneself up in Agent Provocateur lingerie? In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_Trouble" target="_blank"><strong>Gender Trouble</strong></a>, Butler explores the spaces of resistance to dominant discourses. Like Foucault, and with reference to his work, she asks how we can go beyond the boundaries imposed on us by discourse, and explores the concept of agency. Gender and identity are more of a “doing” than a “becoming”, and are constantly shaped by discourse. Like any woman, the Agent Provocateur woman’s identity is fluid. She is constantly made and remade by the forces around her.</p>

<li><em>We’re pleased to welcome Libby of the feminist-friendly <a href="http://treasuryislands.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">TreasuryIslands</a> blog back to our soapbox today. (She&#8217;s officially our most recurring guest!) If you have a guest post a-brewing, <a href="mailto:badrepeditors@gmail.com?subject=pitch">email us on badrepeditors@gmail.com</a>.</em>

<p><strong>American Horror Story</strong> is sexy.</p>
<p>No, let me rephrase that.</p>
<p>American Horror Story is SEXY. It emanates sweet tendrils of hotness, wisps of decadent, lustful sexual deviance and sultry taboo, while trotting apace through a veritable phalanx of horror tropes and borrowing heavily from the classics of the genre. I love it. It is also, in the words of the hilarious <a href="http://isthisfeminist.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Is This Feminist? tumblr</a>, PROBLEMATIC.</p>

<p>And who’s surprised, really? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Murphy_(writer)" target="_blank">Ryan Murphy</a>’s work is characterised by its casual misogyny (yo, <strong>Nip/Tuck</strong>, <strong>Glee</strong>, I’m looking at you) and so is horror as a genre. So not me, no. I’m not surprised, Mr Murphy, I’m not even angry. I’m just disappointed. Maybe you should go to your room and think about what you’ve done.</p>
<p>Now, don’t get me wrong. <strong>AHS</strong> is, by any critical standard, a terrible, terrible show. It’s fractured and bombastic and desperately wants to be, like, profound. But it’s not. It’s&#8230; y’know. Crap.</p>
<p>But luckily, I’m not a TV critic, so I bloody love it. And I’m allowed to love it because cognitive dissonance. This show is simply dripping with things that ought to make me hate it. And I do. I spit expletives at the screen. I rage against the covert anti-abortionism and the exploitative male gaze. And then I rewind and watch it again. Because, like I said. Cognitive dissonance.</p>
<p>I’m going to handle <strong>AHS</strong> in two parts. Today I’ll be examining the show&#8217;s representations of women as lovers and mothers, before looking at pregnancy, birth and maternal desire in the next exciting instalment.</p>
<p><strong>Before I go on, beware. Here be SPOILERS.</strong></p>
<h3>Predatory Women in the Male Gaze</h3>
<p><strong>AHS</strong> is not much more than your typical haunted house story. It begins and ends with the house, designated ‘Murder House’ by local legend and built by Charles and Nora Montgomery decades before our protagonists &#8211; we’ll get to them later &#8211; were born.</p>
<p>The Montgomerys run an illegal abortion clinic from the basement, providing discreet help to women in trouble and fuelling the God complex which eventually sees the ether-addicted Charles sew together a Franken-baby &#8211; known as the Infanta &#8211; for his wife to care for. If we were looking for a symbolic representation of threat to the constructed (read: patriarchal) order of things, well, it doesn’t get any more obvious than that. Like Dr Frankenstein, Charles blurs the boundaries not just between God and man but also between male and female roles by creating life, upsetting the proper balance of the house and setting in motion the events which follow.</p>
<p>Nora and Charles’ lives end in a murder-suicide at Nora’s hand. Thus, they become the first to haunt the house.The third post-human (‘ghost’ is such an oppressive term, right?) resident of the house is Moira. Let’s start her story with a little pop quiz:</p>
<p><em>You, the lady of the house, enter your home to hear a woman being sexually assaulted. You pick up a gun &#8211; because they’re totally safe to have around when emotions are running high &#8211; and enter the master bedroom to find your husband raping the maid. You point the gun and fire. Who did you just kill? Was it &#8211;</em></p>
<p><em>a) your husband, because he’s a rapey scumbag?</em><br />
<em> b) Moira the maid, because, er&#8230; um&#8230; she’s there too?</em></p>
<p>If you said <em>b) Moira the maid</em>, congratulations! You hate women as much as <strong>American Horror Story</strong> does!</p>
<p>To be fair, this woman scorned does go on to shoot her husband too, but that maid, well. She was probably asking for it, wasn’t she, all walking around in clothes and getting on with her job and having breasts. What a slut.</p>
<p>Regardless of her intention or her consent, Moira is now a sexual predator, in death forced to play the role perceived as hers in life, and becomes a Jekyll-and-Hyde figure. The women she encounters see her as a sexless middle-aged woman, while the men (who, it seems, see only what they want to see) see a young, beautiful and carnivorously sexual temptress, seeking to undermine, manipulate or overthrow men through the power of her sexuality. She is the virgin/whore dichotomy made flesh.</p>
<p>I could get into how heterosexist this is, but frankly we’d be here for days. The height of Moira’s sexual power comes with the literal castration of the man who most poses a threat to her. Dr. Freud, you’re needed in the Literalisation of Symbolic Acts ward. Bring a towel.</p>
<p>The newest residents of Murder House are Vivien and Ben Harmon, a Bostonian couple intent on running away and leaving their marital problems behind them, because that always works. Moving into their suspiciously underpriced new home with their adolescent daughter is their first step towards repairing the damage done to the partnership by Ben’s affair with a student named Hayden in the aftermath of Vivien’s miscarriage.</p>
<p>Just as Moira ends up dead for having sex and getting above her station, so does Hayden. Hayden’s not above throwing herself at Ben, turning up at his home in an act of seduction and intimidation to rival the fatal-est of femmes.</p>
<p>We’re encouraged into this reading of women as wild by the show&#8217;s insistent male gaze.</p>
<p>A complex mythology that rules whether or not the ghosts age ensures that we get enough young female flesh to look at. There are lingering shots of gartered thighs and softly rising décolletée, there are those close, oppressive, slightly-from-above camera angles that make you feel like you dominate the subject &#8211; and there are straight-up no-holds-barred crotch shots. All of these things make sure we know where, and how, to look.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">These women are women as men wish (or as gay men think straight/bi men wish) to see them: willing harbingers of sexual pleasure, built in the eye of the camera from tits and ass.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">They’re supple-breasted and conveniently bisexual, with sexuality so magnetic that Ben must masturbate furiously &#8211; crying all the while &#8211; to stop himself from giving in to them. Where women are concerned, perceived sexual immorality is a barometer for bad. They are debased, and they will hurt you.</p>
<h3>The hand that rocks the cradle is the hand that rules the world</h3>
<p>Motherhood comes in for a bad rap on <strong>AHS</strong>. From episode one (where Vivien’s longed for-pregnancy is spoken of in terms of an unwanted visitor violating the sacred space of the home) to the monstrous child-delivery at the end of the season, childbearing is painted as a threat to patriarchal social order. I’ll talk more about that next time, but for now I want to concentrate on what happens once you’ve got a bleating infant in your arms.</p>
<p>Another previous resident of Vivien and Ben’s home, and one of the few that is still living, is local Mommie Dearest Constance Langdon. She’s the self-appointed caretaker of the house, an amoral force of unfathomable intentions who appears to consider <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norma_Bates_(Psycho)" target="_blank">Mrs Bates</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_White" target="_blank">Margaret White</a> her parenting role models.</p>
<p>Constance is a cruel, jealous single parent, abusing and using her children by turns. Unable to relinquish control of her brood as they age, and thus not allowing them autonomous identities, she ensures that dysfunction reins in the Langdon household.</p>
<p>She treats <a href="http://specialchildren.about.com/b/2011/10/05/will-this-depiction-of-down-syndrome-be-a-horror-story.htm" target="_blank">her daughter Addie</a>, who has Down syndrome, as a sexual competitor. She imprisons both her daughter and her heavily-disfigured eldest son, the ironically-named Beauregard, in the home (sometimes resorting to shackles and chains as a demonstration of her sovereignty) and gleefully tells Addie that she’ll never be a &#8216;pretty girl&#8217;.<sup><a href="/2012/12/03/guest-post-on-american-horror-story-part-12-lovers-and-mothers/#footnote_0_12758" id="identifier_0_12758" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" Ed&rsquo;s Tiny Note: For more on Addie and how she is portrayed and treated, there&rsquo;s a critical look at her role at Fangs for the Fantasy. Down Syndrome Daily also has a roundup of US press reactions to the character, some of which I think betray ableist prejudice in themselves, and some of which make good points. ">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Although all of her children are dead before they reach adulthood, the youngest remains as one of the fully corporeal phantoms haunting the Harmon household. Despite her treatment of her children, Constance is willing to kill to keep them together. The whole set-up screams narcissistic abuse.</p>
<p>Constance’s stranglehold over her youngest son, Tate, has prevented him from self-actualisation and produced an emotionally scarred adolescent, narcissistic and hypermasculine, who apes his mother in his desire for control over the bodies of others, raping and indiscriminately killing in order to exert his ownership. What a charmer.</p>
<p>Tate’s emotional state almost demands to be analysed as a reaction to Constance&#8217;s total control over the boy in the second stage of psychosexual development, which coincides with toilet training and in which autonomy is developed. Constance’s suppression of Tate’s self-actualisation has resulted in a rebellious, cruel, emotionally volatile adolescent who is so eager to please the woman he’s fixated on that he’ll commit terrible acts to gain her approval. It’s desperately clichéd.</p>
<p>Sexualised as it is, <strong>AHS</strong>’ regular female cast is not made up of victims in the great tradition of the genre: they don’t get cut up, and there’s no running through dark corridors in strategically torn clothing or fumbling ineffectually with locks that they could work perfectly well a minute ago.</p>
<p>This has caused some people to herald the show as a feminist buoy, bobbing about in the misogynist soup of Horror. Such is the jubilation at the thought that women might be allowed some agency, the flipside is missed. The show doesn’t victimise its women; it demonises them. In this world women are either maidens or mothers, either sexual or not.</p>
<p>And damn, they’ve got it in for you.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[What happens if you dress as a monster people can't easily gender, go to a comic con, and troll the FREE HUGS meme? Here is what happens.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re reading this, I assume you know what a comic convention is. Right? Cool. We&#8217;re on the same page.</p>
<p>You may also be aware of the FREE HUGS meme. It&#8217;s quite sweet: you hold a sign with &#8220;FREE HUGS&#8221; on it, and people can come to you to claim their free hug. Because free things are nice, hugs shouldn&#8217;t be charged for, and aaahhh and d&#8217;awww and other such sentiments. FREE HUGSing is very prevalent at comic conventions.</p>
<p>Having set that up, let me tell you a tale.</p>
<p>The scene: a large and popular comic convention held in a large and popular UK city. It&#8217;s spring, verging on summer, and it&#8217;s warm.</p>
<p>Cosplayers roam the convention with absurdly large props and wigs, and excited teenagers clutch bags of stash from their favourite webcomic artists, faces flushed with glee. Someone is dressed as a cardboard box. Someone else has a large plush Totoro. Gangs of Stormtroopers march about, videogame demos blare and cameras flash.</p>
<p>Numerous people saunter about, idly holding scraps of paper with &#8220;FREE HUGS&#8221; scrawled on them in pen, either because it&#8217;s what everyone is doing, or because they hope for a tiny scrap of human affection in this amazing sea of other people&#8217;s playtime.</p>
<p>Something terrible jingles past.</p>
<p>A long, thin, white jingling thing, with no real face and long tentacular horns. It has claws and hooves and no eyes and&#8230; a FREE HUGS sign all of its own.</p>
<div id="attachment_12554" style="width: 322px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/IMG_3557.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12554" data-attachment-id="12554" data-permalink="/2012/10/24/free-hugs-or-markgrafs-comic-convention-adventure/img_3557/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/IMG_3557-e1350399512342.jpg?fit=2304%2C3072&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="2304,3072" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;3.5&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon DIGITAL IXUS 75&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1338020814&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;8.462&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;250&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.016666666666667&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="baylonatmcm" data-image-description="&lt;p&gt;A pale-skinned person, almost fully encompassed by their costume, wearing a white monster mask which has no facial features except two long vertical slits with protruding antler-like tentacles.  The monster has a long, shimmering iridescent mane that hangs to their waist, and long, blood-soaked talons.  The costume also has several coin belts around the hips, a fur collar, and long, thigh-length white boots with a high platform and no heel, giving the impression of hooves.  The boot heels have long, backwards facing tentacles, also white, tipped with pink.  The monster is standing in a convention hall, between some comic stalls.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Do you hug it?</p>
<p>My costume monster, Babylon, is a non-gendered-but-femme creature, with no anthropomorphic secondary sex characteristics, but with performatively femme behaviour.</p>
<p>Now, as it is rare for women to &#8220;perform&#8221; their femininity, performative femininity generally tends to be the preserve of people that don&#8217;t identify as women &#8211; because &#8220;performance&#8221; indicates a degree of &#8220;artifice&#8221;, and it is unusual for someone to &#8220;put on&#8221; the presentation that&#8217;s generally considered &#8220;appropriate&#8221; for their identity.</p>
<p>(But of course, it does happen, because everything does, and identity and presentation are two different things and being a woman doesn&#8217;t make your presentation femme by default, so of course one <em>can</em> identify as female and also perform your femininity. That&#8217;s a thing that happens too. I don&#8217;t need to explain these things to you: you know about stuff, you&#8217;re all down with this. Back to telling the tale.)</p>
<p>So. Big, sparkly performance femme-ness is A Thing and a grand one at that &#8211; just, not necessarily tethered to a gender identity.  So Babylon is very hard to read. It&#8217;s too over-the-top femme to be a girl, but surely boy monsters are big and spiky, right?</p>
<p>Obviously, the answer is that Babylon is non-binary, but our average member of the public in need of a full Gender 101 isn&#8217;t going to assume that.</p>
<p>I had lots of fun wearing Babylon during the convention, mostly because it is nice to dress as a monster, but also because I discovered a few interesting things about how people interact with an ungenderable non-human costume.</p>
<ul>
<li>Teenage girls with stripy armwarmers shrieked with delight at Babylon, largely gendered it male, and happily gave it hugs.</li>
<li>Women my age wanted photographs and loved Babylon&#8217;s boots.</li>
<li>Older steampunk gentlemen gendered it female and wanted photographs.</li>
</ul>
<p>But the most hilarious demographic by far was teenage boys, and other men in costumes.</p>
<p>Teenage boys roam in knots about conventions, all holding papery requests for hugs. Their knuckles blanched as their grip on their FREE HUGS signs tightened when Babylon indicated that their desire for hugs was the same, and came over to hug them.</p>
<p>Oh, they didn&#8217;t like it. Oh, teenage boys didn&#8217;t like the Babylon. Oh no.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; they said.<br />
&#8220;Urgh,&#8221; they said.<br />
&#8220;Oh man, it&#8217;s a <em>bloke</em>, mate,&#8221; they said.</p>
<p>Babylon is not a bloke. I&#8217;m a bloke; Babylon is a Babylon. They didn&#8217;t want photographs.</p>
<div style="width: 394px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" title="babylondrawing" src="https://i2.wp.com/farm8.staticflickr.com/7041/6939472029_6d7720793b_o.jpg?resize=384%2C476" alt="A drawing of the white, tentacled monster from the costume, emerging from a hole in the ground.  It is facing left, and has its claws on the edges of the hole, pulling itself up.  Its arms are thin and muscular, and have apparen veins.  The whole image is coloured and richly textured.  The background is a dirty, earthy colour, making a sharp contrast with the pure white monster and its bloody pink and red tentacles and talons." width="384" height="476" data-recalc-dims="1" /><p class="wp-caption-text">slrrrrrrrpp</p></div>
<p>You probably see where I&#8217;m going with this. My next example is brilliant.</p>
<p>I Babyloned up to a group of Star Wars <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormtrooper_(Star_Wars)" target="_blank">Stormtroopers</a>. Now, I rather like masks and men in uniform, so I saw this as a brilliant opportunity to put the &#8220;play&#8221; into &#8220;cosplay&#8221; and be an alien at them. Which is what I did.</p>
<p>Babylon jingled everywhere and posed for photographs, and one of the chaps, reading Babylon as female, got a bit saucy with it. This is fine, and Babylon, of course, sauced right back, all jingly silver bits and long talons &#8211; and then the Stormtrooper asked us, &#8220;Getting a bit hot are we, ma&#8217;am?&#8221;</p>
<p>Babylon made a surprised gesture (it doesn&#8217;t have a mouth) and indicated that he was wrong, and it wasn&#8217;t a &#8220;ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>

He backed right off.</p>
<p>I wondered if this was the first time in his life that he had ever had anyone he had not been sexually interested in being flirtatious and forward at him.</p>
<p>I idly thought about all the times I&#8217;ve been out with lady friends of mine who&#8217;ve experienced street harassment. Random strangers making sexual advances they weren&#8217;t comfortable with. I suppressed the urge to tear off my monster mask and bellow, &#8220;HUURARRRGGH, FEMINISM, NYERRRGH&#8221; and spray liquid feminism at him from my nipples.</p>
<p>Remembering that I&#8217;ve been told that sort of behaviour &#8220;hurts the cause&#8221;, I kept my mask on and flounced off elsewhere.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the moral to this post? There isn&#8217;t one, really. It was just an amazing, beautiful, interesting and inspirational experience to be both fully androgynous and have no face.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m androgynous myself in presentation and I get gendered more-or-less randomly, but I have a <em>human face</em>, and this means I get treated differently from if I don&#8217;t. <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/06/21/slutwalk-where-are-we/" target="_blank"><strong>Some of the roughest transphobia I’ve ever had was when I was masked</strong></a>, and I don’t think that was a coincidence. Babylon doesn&#8217;t have anything like a human face: just two slits with emergent tentacles, and this simultaneously intimidates people and makes them feel more free to loudly express their opinion of it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be at the large, popular comic convention again at the end of October. If you&#8217;re going too this Hallowe&#8217;en, come and find us and give us a hug!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Page 3's been the horsefly on the cowpat of the Sun newspaper for years. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Page 3, revered by its supporters as &#8216;a British institution&#8217; and pushed by its owners as &#8217;empowering&#8217;, has been the horsefly on the cowpat of the Sun newspaper for years. In my early teens, pre-Internet, a glimpse of tit from a discarded copy of the Sun was my first vision of a naked breast. I&#8217;m also fairly sure it was the exact moment that I decided that mainstream, unimaginative, plastic-and-makeup porn wasn&#8217;t for me, but I digress.</p>
<p>Other people have made better arguments (<a title="The Sun's Page 3 is the highly visible tip of misogyny's iceberg" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/sep/14/sun-page-3-visible-tip-misogynys-iceberg" target="_blank">here&#8217;s one</a>, and <a title="Could this campaign to stop Page 3 succeed?" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/shortcuts/2012/sep/11/campaign-stop-page-3-succeed" target="_blank">here&#8217;s another</a>) than I could for why having a teenager with her tits out in the first few pages of a national newspaper might not be a particularly stellar idea. It&#8217;s objectification at its worst, and the empowerment argument neglects the fact that there are better, safer, and more rewarding ways to take your clothes off for financial gain if that&#8217;s what you truly want to do.</p>
<p>My argument against Page 3 is quite simple; if you don&#8217;t want to reject it simply because it&#8217;s in bad taste, insensitive, and chauvinistic, then reject it because it uses psychological techniques to manipulate your views into agreeing with whatever fits the Sun&#8217;s goals at the time. The Sun sees its readership not just as customers, but as bargaining chips and weapons.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a quick look at a few examples of Page 3. The rather excellent <a title="Tim Ireland" href="http://www.bloggerheads.com/business/" target="_blank">Tim Ireland</a> over at <a title="Bloggerheads" href="http://bloggerheads.com" target="_blank">Bloggerheads</a>, nemesis of Nadine Dorries, has been collecting these &#8211;  I hope he won’t mind me mirroring them here. Credit due entirely to him and anyone who might have scanned them for him.</p>

<p>Now, it&#8217;s quite possible that these women hold these opinions. It&#8217;s quite interesting, however, that they coincide with the vitriol that appears in the <em>The Sun Says</em> portion of the paper, home of a much more blatant attempt to tell their readership what to think.</p>
<p>Think about this, though &#8211; what if these statements are invented by the paper? Then, what we have on our hands is a cheap attempt to use <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14674817/" target="_blank">the many cognitive biases that sexual attraction brings into play</a> to form an opinion in the undecided. This person is attractive; you&#8217;re naturally more inclined to agree with people that you find attractive; your opinion is swayed. All the time, you&#8217;re seeing it as just a bit of fun, just a silly piece of paper with a pair of breasts. Every day, this message hits home. Over time, it affects people &#8211; they think the way the Sun, and thus the Murdoch empire, wants them to think.</p>
<p>Yes, alright, I&#8217;ve strayed a bit into tin-foil-hat territory. The fact is, though, that this is having an effect on the Sun&#8217;s readership. How big an effect is arguable, of course, but it&#8217;s non-zero. Also, don&#8217;t forget that there&#8217;s a huge line on the role of these women &#8211; they&#8217;re being used as tools, to have opinions thrust into their mouths. Even the names are probably pseudonyms. They are there for no reason <em>at all</em> other than to be a pair of tits, and that shit is just not on.</p>
<p>If you won&#8217;t boycott the Sun because you hate the exploitation and objectification of women that it represents, boycott it because you value your own power of self-determination.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[If I arrive tomorrow at work with a ‘male’ business suit on, will I be taken more seriously? Am I feminine enough for the office if I don’t wear flawless makeup – or any makeup? ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dress codes (the set of ‘rules’ that govern what we wear in specific situations) are present in every facet of our daily lives, whether explicitly stated or inherently assumed. For this article, there’s only one dress code I want to talk about: what you wear at work.</p>

<p>The working ‘uniform’ is ubiquitous to a huge number of professions, despite the possibility that many of us associate it first and foremost with the service industries. By service industries, I don’t mean simply <a href="http://www.yumsugar.com/New-McDonalds-Uniforms-Love-Hate-1578851">McDonald’s workers</a>, Tesco employees or the like; service means serving you (the consumer) through labour. Retail fashion workers are a prime example, where the ‘uniform’ may not be a classic sweatshirt-and-trousers combo, but rather items picked solely from the collection of garments that the shop provides – living mannequins, in a sense. But this is getting way ahead of myself; let’s go back a bit.</p>
<p>Wearing a uniform, as so many <a href="http://debatemate.wordpress.com/2010/11/19/this-house-would-ban-school-uniforms/">sixth form debates have pointed out</a>, has both positive and negative effects on the individual and the group in any given institution. School uniform has the apparent benefit of making everyone equal (at least, visually) while at the same time ensuring creative idiosyncratic fashion choices are made in the smallest details; how many buttons are done up, how the tie is tied, what badges you wear and the jewellery you sneak in. Even in a photo that has been <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/green-living-blog/2010/aug/23/school-uniforms-cheap-ethical-concerns">posed for this<strong> Guardian</strong> piece</a>, the same uniform turns up in many different styles. So what about the uniform at work? I’ve worked in enough poorly-paid retail jobs to realise what the proposed function of a uniform is, and what actually happens when you wear it.</p>
<p>Just like at school, a uniform is meant to show that all the wearers are equal – visually. For the consumer, workers are identified by what they are wearing; many a time I have been asked in various shops where the changing rooms are, because my particular garb is close enough to the ‘uniform’ of a retail fashion worker to confuse the consumer (although mostly this happens in charity shops. I’m down with that). Workers are set apart from consumers and grouped together as labour through their uniform.</p>
<p>However, looking the same and being the same are (duh) different. My manager and I wear the same uniform: shirt, trousers, and name badge – but are we the same? No. She’s the <em>manager</em>; she’s my boss. Confusing messages of similarity (and potential solidarity?) and hidden hierarchies abound with the working uniform, especially in retail sectors where more than one hierarchy is on the ‘working floor’. You might be able to argue that those industries in which workers are physically grouped by hierarchy – like the factory floor, where the manager is not as physically ‘present’ as on the shop floor – are able to recognise the uniform’s messages of similarity and solidarity more effectively than those where workers of disparate hierarchies are bundled in together.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://bobbypinblog.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/vintage-beautician-uniforms-and-smocks.html">Bobby Pin</a>, these are 1950s beauty salon uniforms:</p>

For this author, they’re utterly beautiful. But then I am a total sucker for ‘the giant coachman collar’.</p></div>
<p>As well as hierarchy being hidden (but strangely elaborated too, I suppose, by its hiddenness), gender too, is at least under an attempted disguise through the wearing of uniforms. Gone are the days of <strong>Mad Men</strong>, where women wore skirts and men wore trousers – now we <em>all</em> have to wear trousers, and horrible polo shirts too. An apparently gender-neutral uniform is provided in a number of sectors (mine was previously white shirt and black trousers – or skirt) that never really successfully disguises gender to the consumer in the same way that it conceals hierarchy to some extent. One-size-fits-all doesn’t work, especially if the size is designed for someone who doesn’t have breasts.</p>

Or, at least, they don’t tell you that you have a uniform. Explicitly, the dress code might be not much more than ‘no shorts or clogs’, but implicitly, the dress code will be bending and morphing round the individuals who are adhering to and working against it. This dress code will tie in gender and authority hierarchies, as illustrated by the business suit and its female equivalent.</p>
<p>From my employment experience (and others who have agreed with me), men wear business suits, but women do not wear business suits, despite this (again) apparently gender-neutral ‘uniform’ being available. A number of women working in offices might wear the <a href="http://www.next.co.uk/women/tailored-looks">female equivalent of the business suit</a> (Next surely embodies this look), which more often than not includes a) skirt b) something frilly c) front-cover-flawless makeup. So it’s the business suit, plus a) traditional emblem of femininity b) annoying and impractical emblem of femininity c) emblem of femininity that is often perceived to be caused by heavy external pressures to look good at all times. The visual ‘uniform’ of the business suit is not gender-neutral, because it is adapted to become gender-specific; whether this is due to individual taste or workplace culture, I’m unsure, but it does inform the hierarchy of the office.</p>

Love. Her.</p></div>The dress code in some offices (especially creative industries) is not always specified explicitly; you might not have to wear a suit, you could wear jeans whenever you please, and if you want to turn up <a href="http://www.rad80sfashion.com/cyndi-lauper.htm">dressed like Cyndi Lauper</a>, by gum you can do. However, the adage of ‘dress for the job you want, not the job you have’ rings in my ears; you can do all those things, but will doing so damage employment opportunities because you haven’t adhered to the implicit dress code? Inter-departmental hierarchies are neatly displayed in adherence to or ignorance of the implicit dress code; if all the workers who were lower paid began to wear the business suits of those who are highest paid, would you be able to see a more democratic office?</p>
<p>Rather than looking at personal comments regarding taste that may be made about office workwear, my interest instead lies in how this implicit dress code dramatically affects the hierarchical makeup of a working environment, potentially without many of the individuals involved even being fully aware of how it is being shaped around them. If I arrive tomorrow at work with a ‘male’ business suit on, will I be taken more seriously? Or, as a woman, if I arrive in a simulated version of that ‘male’ business suit, will I be declined respect because I appear too much like one of the boys? Am I feminine enough for the office if I don’t wear flawless makeup – or any makeup? If I start dressing like the big boys, will they still know it’s me on the inside? I believe there is a definite question of sexuality and sexual preference here that comes into play with ‘levels’ of femininity in the workplace, although I don’t feel able to tackle this in great detail here (or just yet).</p>
<p>Workplace hierarchies are constituted through a vast number of factors, but the role of dress and dress codes is one that can’t be ignored. From traditional environments where gender and authority hierarchies may have been distinguished and designated by an explicit uniform placed upon the workers, contemporary working environments – especially those in the creative industries – now have to juggle with an implicit dress code that is created and defined by the workers themselves (across all hierarchies) in their clothing choices. Plus, there is the added element of workers’ perception of the importance of that dress code or, conversely, the desire to play with it and break some boundaries, in designating what you can, or can’t, wear to work.</p>

It sells itself to advertisers as having ‘the wealthiest readership in the UK’ and accordingly peddles luxury goods and the accompanying lifestyle to Society dahlings and their postulant doppelgangers. The magazine worships the higher reaches of British class structures, fawning over those who through their money, their fame or their postcode can be considered ‘society’ and celebrating an incongruous, archaic social order.</p>
<p><strong>Tatler</strong> seems an unlikely champion of diversity. The world it represents is one of deep privilege in which abide the casts of Jilly Cooper novels: men of title or profession and their charity-supporting wives; women in Jaeger gilets and and twentysomethings who order £19 martinis; the worst upper class caricatures made flesh for their own amusement and forwarded as role models for the aspirant gaggles. But editor Kate Reardon has noticed a problem: gay men, she says, are widely represented in Society but gay women are not, and she’s going to do something about it.</p>
<p>Her reasoning is thus: lady-lovers make people ‘either titillated or a little bit frightened’ &#8211; a conclusion I can only assume was arrived at with a sense of deep profundity at 3am and through the bottom of a cocktail glass &#8211; and claiming that parents are thrilled when their sons come out but embarrassed when their daughters do. Lesbians, she says, have never been accepted by High Society, a fact that Virginia Woolf, Natalie Clifford Barney and Betty Carstairs apparently missed the memo on. The way to address this problem, obviously, is to find some sapphic sisters and do a feature on them. Choose wisely, though. None too butch, none too&#8230; y’know&#8230; dykey, and if they’re over a size 12 then headshots only.</p>
<p>The fact is that she may well be right, but the issue is not one of sexuality but of gender &#8211; lesbians don’t have the status and visibility of gay men because women don’t have the status and visibility of men. A magazine which targets an overwhelmingly female audience (around 80%) is a routine place to celebrate women, and putting a handful of queer ladies in the spotlight is never going to be a bad thing.</p>

The problem is that <strong>Tatler</strong> isn’t exactly bashful when it comes to creating a sensation when sales are falling (Anthea Turner naked but for a python, anyone?) and according to Janet Street-Porter in the <strong>Daily Mail</strong> that’s exactly what’s happening right now. With a drop in readership of more than 20% in the last year, and 25% within its target demographic, it’s easy to believe that <strong>Tatler</strong> is just trying to pretty up the sales figures. And why not? <strong>Vanity Fair</strong> saw a boost in audience with its infamous KD Lang/Cindy Crawford cover in 1994 just as defunct soap <strong>Brookside</strong> did with its Beth/Margaret kiss the same year. The mid-nineties may have been the height of lesbian chic, but the same trick might well work today. However easy it is to think that we’ve moved on in this post-<strong>Queer As Folk</strong>, post-<strong>Ellen</strong> world, the promise of a bit of girl-on-girl still sets the collective knees of the nation a-tremblin’.</p>
<p>The feature in <strong>Tatler</strong> is fluff, but what else did we expect? Seven fashion-plate photographs and an ad for a Belgravia-based lesbian and gay introduction agency make what the cover assures us is the definitive portfolio &#8211; though seven is not the definitive portfolio of anything, unless it’s colours of the rainbow &#8211; and takes up fewer pages than cover star Alice Eve. Whoever sent out the press release dubbing this ‘the lesbian issue’ was clearly overstating things a bit. Each photo is accompanied by a brief, soundbitey blurb in which such insights as favorite colour are revealed. It’s an exercise in mediocrity. I mean, they’ve managed to make Sue Perkins dull. How is that even possible?</p>

As well as vaguely hinting that <strong>Tatler</strong> staffers get their jollies shooting wild lesbians in the Home Counties at the weekend, the dodgy syntax in this headline treats the women in the same terms that it does its fashion: the Marc Jacobs shoot; the unfathomably expensive sarong shoot; the lesbian shoot. These women are modelling an accessory, and it is lesbianism. Instead of celebrating gay women, <strong>Tatler</strong> has narrowed the playing field &#8211; as this sort of faux-diverse tokenism often does &#8211; by offering a blueprint for acceptable lesbianism, a whitewashed ideal for the rest of us to not quite live up to.</p>
<p>A black tie dinner (dubbed the ‘lesbian ball’) hosted by <strong>Tatler</strong> in celebration of this barrier-smashing seven-pics-and-an-advert brought 200 women, of all sexualities, together for an evening of networking and masturbatory self-congratulation which, while undoubtedly productive for those involved, did precisely nothing for the women (generally) and lesbians and bi women (specifically) who could actually do with a leg up. This was not a benefit for LGBT charities. It was not the launch event for a campaign seeking to address actual inequality. No speeches were made about why the event was held. It was a party. Just a party. For the most privileged group of women in the UK and with a guest list so diverse that knicker obsessive Mary Portas <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jul/06/lesbianism-society-sapphism-tatler-inspire">was invited</a> <em>even though she’s trade</em>. According to one nameless attendee <a href="http://themostcake.co.uk/culture/tatler-where-are-all-the-lesbians-on-page-94-we-take-a-closer-look-at-the-lesbian-issue-and-that-lesbian-party/">over on themostcake</a>, a spiffing time was had by all, and though the photos don’t show it, I like to think the evening ended with a load of drunken women kicking off their Louboutins and singing ‘I am Woman’ at high volume in the taxi queue.</p>
<p><strong>Tatler</strong> had an opportunity to do some grandstanding and they nibbled on canapes instead. Radical.</p>

<li><em><strong>Libby</strong> earned her feminist stripes interning for the <a href="http://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/">Fawcett Society</a> where she was horrified by most of the stories she heard.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Here&#8217;s a post from <a href="http://nothingbutawordbag.wordpress.com/">Nat Guest</a>. If you have an idea for a guest post brewing in your brain, email us: <a href="mailto:badrepeditors@gmail.com?subject=Guest pitch!">badrepeditors@gmail.com</a>.</strong></p>
<p>A confession: I write fanfiction.</p>
<p>I’ll let that sink in for a moment, whilst you judge me and leap to all the usual conclusions. At least half of them will be reasonably correct.</p>
<p>For starters, let’s clear up some myths. Fanfiction isn’t about porn. Or, at least, it isn’t <em>all</em> about porn. There are as many different genres out there as there are genres of fiction, as many reasons for reading and writing it as there are readers and writers of it. And it isn’t exactly an obscure pastime; on fanfiction.net (the largest, if most mainstream and therefore frowned-upon collection of fanfic) there are 593,713 fics listed under the Harry Potter category alone.</p>

Widely derided, it’s dismissed as the home of squeeing fangirls high on sugar and manga, or else of hopeless deviants: furries, kink-seekers and the downright filthy. Both of these are, technically, perfectly accurate. Fanfiction gets a bad rep, as do its advocates, and honestly &#8211; there&#8217;s good reason for that. A lot of it is absolutely terrible (the infamous <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/my-immortal-the-worst-fanfiction-ever">My Immortal</a>, for example), and a lot of it&#8217;s cringeworthy wish-fulfilment crawling with <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue">Mary Sues</a>. But to pretend that that’s <em>all</em> it is, is to do it a huge disservice.</p>
<p>Here’s one of my favourite quotes about it, used by Sheenagh Pugh in her book <a href="http://sheenagh.webs.com/thedemocraticgenre.htm"><strong>The Democratic Genre: Fanfiction in a Literary Context</strong></a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s always been high praise in Fannish circles to be told that you wrote a story so good it should be published, but sometimes, the highest praise is that it can&#8217;t be. Its very uniqueness, what creates it, makes it impossible to be anything else. Lots of people can write stories that fall into readable (more than you think, actually, but I&#8217;m flexible on the idea of readable), and many can write stories I&#8217;d pay to read, and even some write stories that could be published and be great. But there&#8217;s this small, fascinating group that write a story that belongs only to the fandom that created it. It&#8217;s like having a treasure you never have to share. It wraps itself in the canon and fanon and the author&#8217;s own mind that created it and takes it as its own so perfectly that you are so damn glad you went into that fandom, just grateful, just absolutely thrilled, because you get to read this.</p></blockquote>
<p>Every fic, without exception, is a product of its fandom. Reading a fic is not just reading a simple story: what you’re actually reading is an intertwining of fanlore, mixing in-jokes and terminology from one particular fandom, as well as from the broader history and narrative of fandom. That’s why they can appear so incoherent and ridiculous to the outside world at times. Fanfiction authors are less writing a story than weaving together a cultural tapestry.</p>
<p>Fanfiction has a proud and noble tradition, as anyone entrenched within the community will tell you. Every student of fanlore knows where the term <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shipping_(fandom)">“ship”</a> arose (<strong>X Files</strong> fandom), and where the term <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_fiction">“slash”</a> arose (<strong>Star Trek</strong> fandom). We have our own history; from the pre-internet fanzines, to early Usenet groups, right through to the great shipping wars of <strong>Harry Potter</strong> and the arguments over whether RPF (Real Person Fic; fanfiction about “real” people) is morally acceptable (the earliest known concrete example of RPF comes from the Bronte sisters, who used to write reams of stuff about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gondal_(fictional_country)">fictional country of Gondal</a>. It can be easily argued that there was a huge amount of RPF within the oral tradition, as people passed down stories about folkloric legends such as Robin Hood, King Arthur, and &#8211; yeah, I’m going to go there &#8211; Jesus). We know our lore and our mythology and our terminology, and we study it as arduously as disciples of any other body of text.</p>
<p>Whilst I do stress that a lot of fanfiction out there is non-sexual and non-romantic in content (it’s called <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenFic">gen fic</a>, yo, look it up), there’s an inarguable trend towards sexytimes. I’m all down with that; I like a bit of story with my porn, and I’m not a very visual person, so fanfiction is where I discovered a lot about myself and my own sexuality. I think I started reading fanfiction when I was about 13 or 14, and nowhere near, ahem, “active”. My first ever ship was Rupert Giles/Jenny Calendar. It was a while after that until I discovered slash, although that discovery was, frankly, inevitable – I had a bit of a sweet-tooth for Harry/Draco (Drarry, if you will). Fanfiction was (and still is!) a safe space to explore my own sexuality, and discover the kaleidoscope of sexualities, genders and identities that are out there. It was many years before I’d hear the name Judith Butler, or even hear the slightest mention of ‘queer theory’, but when I did, none of the ideas seemed particularly new to me.</p>
<p>Whilst there are plenty of male writers of fanfiction (especially within the gaming community &#8211; shout out to my little bro!) authorship is overwhelmingly female, and I don’t think that that’s a coincidence. Out in the real world, it’s difficult to own our own sexuality; there’s simply no room for shades of grey. You’re either frigid or a slut; you’re either straight or gay; your sexuality and identity is whatever people perceive when they look at you. But within the fanfiction community, away from the patriarchal mainstream, we can discover and explore how we feel about our own sexual and gender and personal identity. That’s something that I think has had more effect on my life than anything else. Through the medium of fandom, we can find out who we are, and what we like, and how we feel, all through just reading stories together. And then hopefully &#8211; eventually &#8211; we get to write our own story.</p>
<p>This is people writing because they love it, for no purpose other than writing for themselves and for other people who they vaguely know on the internet. It’s done purely for the joy of the thing. And it isn&#8217;t just about the fic itself; the fandom community is the most genre-savvy, theory-aware, innovative group of people I’ve ever had the pleasure to tangle with. This is a community alive with discussion about narrative, metanarrative, referentialism &#038; self referentialism, literary theory, gender and sexuality, social justice, morality, pop culture and in-jokes. I’d also argue that it’s an innately queer community; it not only exists between the cracks, but thrives on the cracks. And in a world where deconstruction and theory are often frowned upon as &#8220;thinking about things too much&#8221;, fandom is where I found a home.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I want to know why pretty much all of Disney's villains display some kind of sexual or gender deviance.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>In 1937 Goebbels presented a birthday gift of 18 Mickey Mouse shorts to the Führer. [&#8230;Disney] and Hitler [&#8230;] shared an overall social vision. They dreamed of a dispersed post-urban society, with a population — kept in line by a strong domestic realm instilling a keen sense of blood loyalty and &#8220;family values&#8221; — that could be efficiently mobilized to serve either the military needs of the state or the labor needs of industry.</p>
<p>&#8211; Matt Roth, <strong><a href="http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC40folder/LionKing.html">The Lion King: a Short History of Disney-Fascism</a></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Everyone knows about Disney&#8217;s ongoing <a href="http://www.cracked.com/article_15677_the-9-most-racist-disney-characters.html">racism issues</a>, so to hear that Uncle Walt was an active member of the American Nazi Party during the Thirties may not come as much surprise. But there were pink triangles as well as yellow stars in 1930s Berlin, and I want to know why pretty much all of Disney&#8217;s villains seem designed to display some kind of sexual or gender deviance.</p>

<p>It starts with Pinocchio, and the Fox and the Cat. Probably best remembered for their song &#8216;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEQjgGMKqt8">An Actor&#8217;s Life for Me</a>&#8216;, it&#8217;s this pair of crooks that first lure young Pinocchio off the straight and narrow. And I mean that literally: they&#8217;re Theatre Folk, dapper, urbane and not a little camp. Their bodies are constantly intertwining, grotesque and chaotic. I&#8217;m with Matt Roth when he says they&#8217;re obviously coded as gay &#8211; one of the key minorities Hitler argued, in <strong>Mein Kampf</strong>, were threatening the health and morality of contemporary  European youth.</p>
<p>But this doesn&#8217;t end with the fall of Hitler; later Disney films work their way through a succession of sexually deviant or ambiguous villains. The first significant entrant is the terrifying <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maleficent" title="Wikipedia: Maleficent">Maleficent</a> in <strong>Sleeping Beauty</strong>(1959). Like <strong>Aladdin</strong>&#8216;s Jafar (1992), she is elegant and a bit camp, though fundamentally sexless (witness how unattracted Jafar is to Princess Jasmine, wanting her only for political gains). Maleficent inhabits a strange underworld where orgiastic parties are the norm, and, like so many of her villainous successors, she&#8217;s got no-one of her own, but still remains determined to thwart the monogamous, heterosexual union of the noble royals Princess Aurora and Prince Philip (whose name was chosen by Uncle Walt in the 50s, when our Prince Philip was still someone nostalgia-loving Anglophile Americans might feel dewy-eyed about).</p>

<p>Two years later, <strong>101 Dalmatians</strong>&#8216; Cruella De Vil continues the trend. She shares Maleficent&#8217;s ill will towards the heteronormative family sphere, and acts as a kind of child-snatching boogyman. Her hyper-femme fashion sense only throws her withered, sexless frame into relief, and unlike the blissful feminine home of her friend Anita &#8211; who has settled down and found a nice man to take care of, sorting out Roger&#8217;s chaotic life with a Woman&#8217;s Touch &#8211;  Cruella&#8217;s decadent mansion is completely falling apart, which we can probably assume also mirrors the state of her biological clock. Cruella&#8217;s flamboyant yet barren sexuality focuses itself instead on fetishising the traditional trappings of femininity, including fur coats made from the produce of wombs more fecund than her own &#8211; like Perdita, the sexy Dalmatian.</p>
<h3>Dragged Up</h3>
<p>In the 80s, long after Walt&#8217;s death, the intentional gender deviance of Disney&#8217;s villains becomes more blatant still: this time the Gays are even more obviously in drag, and they&#8217;re looking back to the golden <strong>Pinocchio</strong> age of seducing The Children away from their suburban homes: think of Ursula in <strong>The Little Mermaid </strong>(1989) and her contrast with the alpha male King Triton, his big beard, and the Barbie-style InnoDBl with her<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SEyW8eXESQk/TpPRCtPiisI/AAAAAAAAATo/brAhE0e1a9w/s1600/littlemermaid2.jpg"> Princess Diana hair</a>.</p>

<p>Ursula is overweight, flamboyant and dragged up; her tentacles, as my pal Matt Roth points out (you really must read <a href="http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC40folder/LionKing.html">this article</a>, seriously), only make her the more sexually ambiguous. Like Maleficent, she lives in an underground other-world, with a &#8216;garden&#8217; of corrupted young people now condemned to live half-lives as plant-like beings. Her stagey hyper-femininity presents her as a dangerous prospect for the heteronormative, cisnormative InnoDBl &#8211; whose <em>voice</em> she steals in order to seduce the also very straight Prince Eric.</p>
<p>Ursula is given a metaphorical kind of new life (after being conquered by, er, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDGrSgTKEuw&amp;t=3m8s">the erect prow of Prince Eric&#8217;s enormous ship</a>) in the figure of Hades in <strong>Hercules </strong>(1997). He&#8217;s pretty much an exact counterpart to Ursula, black tentacles and all. His cabaret-style song &#8216;My Town&#8217;, from the <strong>Hercules</strong> TV series, introduces the underworld as a kind of underground New York, with its king a flamboyant, gender-ambiguous leader revelling in its delights:</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting, of course, that because of the source-text, <strong>Hercules</strong> must of necessity espouse the Ancient Greek worldview that says the Underworld &#8211; and therefore Hades himself &#8211; is a crucial part of the order of things; unlike the shady worlds of Pleasure Island and The Theatre in Nazi-era <strong>Pinocchio</strong>, &#8216;New Hades&#8217;, and the queers and deviants that inhabit it is a potentially corrupting influence that can be tolerated, as long as it&#8217;s kept firmly in its place. It&#8217;s much the same theory as the &#8216;Circle of Life&#8217; proposed by Mufasa in <strong>The Lion King </strong>(1994) &#8211; the ghettoised handout-dependent hyenas and their liberal, childless and urbane overlord Scar are fine, as long as they&#8217;re kept in their own sphere (that is, the obscure Elephants&#8217; Graveyard). When they take over, the Pridelands fall into ruin and corruption.</p>

<h3>Hanging on</h3>
<div id="attachment_10879" style="width: 309px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/LeFou1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10879" data-attachment-id="10879" data-permalink="/2012/07/04/my-town-the-strange-sexuality-of-disneys-underworld/lefou-2/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/LeFou1.jpg?fit=299%2C164&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="299,164" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="LeFou" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/LeFou1.jpg?fit=299%2C164&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/LeFou1.jpg?fit=299%2C164&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-10879" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/LeFou1.jpg?resize=299%2C164" alt="Le Fou fawns on Gaston and constantly occupies his personal space" width="299" height="164" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-10879" class="wp-caption-text">Intertwined: the hyper-masculine Gaston and the fawning creature Le Fou</p></div>
<p>There are also a whole host of less significant characters throughout Disney&#8217;s oeuvre who are mostly made ridiculous by virtue of their sexual ambiguity and concomitant lack of personhood. First up is the rotund Le Fou in <strong>Beauty and the Beast</strong>, who fawns, much like the Cat on the Fox, on the hyper-male Gaston (who is in strange contrast to the uber-femme but dragged up Ursula, and seems suspiciously uninterested in the various females laid on for his consumption).</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s Chi Fu, the emperor&#8217;s advisor in <strong>Mulan</strong>. He is primarily ridiculed because he is camp and rather gender-ambiguous &#8211; he has bunny slippers and a woman&#8217;s scream &#8211; in what I&#8217;d suggest is a double-whammy of homophobia mixed with Orientalist racism, much like that currently directed against Asian-American basketball player Jeremy Lin (<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/feb/21/jeremy-lin-racism-asian-americans">&#8216;Some lucky lady in NYC is gonna feel a couple of inches of pain tonight</a>&#8216; was a tweet from Fox sports commentator Jason Witlock on Lin&#8217;s recent sporting triumph). Or, to put it in Disney&#8217;s own terms, how about the notorious Siamese Cats in <strong>Lady and the Tramp</strong>, whose own gender is confused to say the least?</p>
<h3>Miss Man</h3>
<div id="attachment_10880" style="width: 190px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/mulan1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10880" data-attachment-id="10880" data-permalink="/2012/07/04/my-town-the-strange-sexuality-of-disneys-underworld/mulan-2/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/mulan1.jpg?fit=180%2C255&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="180,255" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="mulan" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/mulan1.jpg?fit=180%2C255&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/mulan1.jpg?fit=180%2C255&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-10880" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/mulan1.jpg?resize=180%2C255" alt="When Mulan's hair is up, she's a man." width="180" height="255" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-10880" class="wp-caption-text">The only difference between male and female Mulan is a bit of grooming.</p></div>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting to compare these gender-fails with Chi Fu&#8217;s own filmic context &#8211; <strong>Mulan </strong>(1998), where the title character is herself cross-dressing. There are two direct references to drag in this film (strange, given that Disney doesn&#8217;t in general have much of Dreamworks&#8217; obsessive-compulsive need to shove in over-the-kids&#8217;-heads jokes for the parents). The only one in direct reference to Mulan is Mushu (Eddie Murphy)&#8217;s Hilarious Ebonics &#8211; &#8216;Miss Man had to take her little drag act on the road&#8217;.</p>
<p>Yet, unlike the true weirdos doing it for a sexual thrill (like Ursula), Mulan&#8217;s is a noble gender-variance, taken on for the sole purpose of rescuing her ailing father and (ultimately) preparing herself mentally for marriage, which is how the film ends; note too that she has to become male in order to truly triumph in the male sphere, and that once this has been accomplished she can return home to her father and marry the sexy shirtless man (as she was unable to do at the beginning of the story).</p>
<p>It is therefore in keeping that her methodology basically amounts to &#8216;hair down = female; hair up = male&#8217; &#8211; and no-one ever notices it&#8217;s all the same person, just with a different hairstyle (note <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3f2is11VL0&amp;t=1m19s">how shocked the Evil Shan Yu is when she dons her &#8216;disguise</a>&#8216;): her gender-switch is more of a &#8216;sign&#8217; to the audience indicating which social sphere she&#8217;s inhabiting than anything literally transformative. Interesting stuff here.</p>
<p>Hmm. So&#8230; From the Fox and the Cat to the villains of the 90s, Disney&#8217;s villains have represented a kind of &#8216;other&#8217; that is almost always couched in terms of gender or sexuality, representing a challenge, and a threat, to the heteronormative worldview of the heroes and heroines &#8211; which always conquers, of course. What&#8217;s disturbing is that it&#8217;s so oft-repeated it almost becomes the whole unspoken tenet on which Disney&#8217;s works are based. The fight of good vs. evil is not so much a battle of objective morality as of sexual identity and preference.</p>
