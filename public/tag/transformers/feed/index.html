<p style="text-align: center;">
<p>I love this cartoon. I sent it to nearly all the women I know last year. Do I need to say why I love it? It so clearly outlines the choices for young girls these days, not just at Halloween. You can be anything you want to be, as long as you&#8217;re sexy. You can be anything, as long as you look good doing it. Anything!! As long as some man somewhere thinks it&#8217;s sexy&#8230;</p>
<p>I mean, the first thing people say about women they&#8217;re trying to insult is usually that they&#8217;re ugly/fat/too old. That they don&#8217;t possess or inspire this all-important male approval. Just think about some of the things you&#8217;ve heard said, by the left <em>and</em> the right, about female politicians. Think about some of the things <em>you</em> might have said.</p>
<p>When men shout or whistle at me in the street and I walk away, what do they shout? They shout &#8220;You fat cow!&#8221; &#8220;You ugly bitch!&#8221; They&#8217;re not alone, every five year-old kid starting school learns that they can upset little girls by calling them fat.</p>
<p>Of course you can also be <em>too</em> sexy, because hey, you wouldn&#8217;t want those people you&#8217;re trying to get the approval of thinking you&#8217;re <em>easy</em> now, would ya? That could interfere with your appeal. But it&#8217;s all related. Be <em>just</em> sexy enough, show <em>just</em> the right amount of skin, look just submissive enough, just powerful enough, don&#8217;t look like you&#8217;re &#8216;asking for it&#8217; (whatever <em>the fuck</em> that means), give that camera <em>just the right look,</em> and you too can be anything you want to be.</p>
<p>To get off the soapbox and back to the subject, Halloween, this day which just highlights something that&#8217;s <em>already</em> going on in our culture, here are a couple of seasonal links for you to enjoy:-</p>
<p>Website <a href="http://takebackhalloween.org/">Take Back Halloween</a> has got a hella load of costumes for you to pick from, and you won&#8217;t find the tagline &#8216;sexy&#8217; on any of them. They&#8217;ve got <a href="http://takebackhalloween.org/category/queens/">warrior queens</a>, <a href="http://takebackhalloween.org/category/goddesses-and-legends/">goddesses and legends</a>, and other <a href="http://takebackhalloween.org/category/notable-women/">famous women</a> to pick from, poets, writers, saints, activists, movie stars and serial killers! They say: <em>&#8220;Why be a fairy princess when you can be a queen?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>The bloggers at <a href="http://geekfeminism.org/">Geek Feminism</a>, with a nod to Take Back Halloween, pick a few geekier costumes which also ignore the male gaze&#8230; <a href="http://geekfeminism.org/2010/10/25/halloween-will-you-be-a-sexy-witch-a-sexy-bee-or-a-sexy-girl-geek/">they&#8217;ve got robots, rubiks cubes and Lovecraftian horrors&#8230;</a> They say: <em>&#8220;There’s no reason that a squid monster can’t have a feminine touch.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Comics Alliance take <a href="http://www.comicsalliance.com/2010/10/21/sexy-superhero-costumes-halloween/">a funny look at some of the most ridiculous and just plain unnecessary &#8216;sexy&#8217; costumes on sale this Halloween</a>, like the cringe-making Transformers costume below. They&#8217;ve very helpfully provided an illustration of what that character is <em>supposed</em> to look like &#8211; can you spot the difference? They&#8217;ve got wildly inaccurate superhero costumes, (and of course, there&#8217;s nothing that upsets this BadRep blogger more than people Doing Comics Wrong!), and they&#8217;ve got sexed-up characters from your other favourite childhood TV shows. There&#8217;s sexy Elmo, a sexy Ninja Turtle and a sexy Lone Ranger!  They say: <em>&#8220;A sexy version of Elmo is the kind of thing that when you see it, you have to tell someone else, or it&#8217;ll just sit there in your brain slowly driving you insane as you try to figure out why it exists.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Cracked.com also has a feature on <a href="http://www.cracked.com/article_18834_26-sexy-halloween-costumes-that-shouldnt-exist.html">26 &#8216;Sexy&#8217; Halloween Costumes That Shouldn&#8217;t Exist</a>.</p>
<p>I think I need to step away from the internet now. When you see a sexy Transfromers costume that&#8217;s the Internet gods&#8217; way of telling you you&#8217;ve been online for too long.</p>
<p>Happy Halloween, folks! I solemnly swear to leave your precious childhood memories alone next time we meet.</p>
