										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Inspired by those plucky Pussy Riot gals and their &#8216;being sent to a penal colony for a peaceful protest&#8217; hi-jinks in Russia last year, I set out to find tracks from riot grrrl bands around the world. And just to shift the focus for once, I&#8217;ve ignored the US, Canada, Australia, Japan, Europe and other super wealthy places.</p>
<p>&#8216;Are there grrrls in the majority world?&#8217; I wondered. The answer is yes, and they rock. In fact I&#8217;ve made a <a title="Majority World Riot Grrrl Playlist" href="http://bit.ly/majoritygrrrl" target="_blank"><strong>Majority World Riot Grrrl playlist</strong></a> which can be found for your delectation. Big shout out to <a title="Riot Grrrl Berlin Compilations" href="http://riotgrrrlberlin.tumblr.com/grrrlcompilations" target="_blank">Riot Grrrl Berlin</a> and their fantastic compilations, on which lots of these bands feature.</p>
<h2><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/tank-girl.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="13254" data-permalink="/2013/03/08/majority-world-riot-grrrl/tank-girl/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/tank-girl.jpg?fit=454%2C381&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="454,381" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Tank Girl Nepal Promo Pic" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/tank-girl.jpg?fit=300%2C252&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/tank-girl.jpg?fit=454%2C381&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignleft  wp-image-13254" alt="Tank Girl Nepal Promo Pic" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/tank-girl.jpg?resize=327%2C275" width="327" height="275" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Nepal</h2>
<p>The first band I found was an anarchafeminist outfit from Nepal called <a title="Tank Girl" href="http://kasamaproject.org/2010/04/14/tank-girl-anarcha-feminist-punk-from-nepal/" target="_blank"><strong>Tank Girl</strong></a>. Nepal has a deeply traditional patriarchal society; marital rape was outlawed only in 2006 and still carries just a six month sentence. Rape survivors are often ostracised, having &#8216;brought shame&#8217; to their family and wider community. Dalit (or &#8216;low-caste&#8217;) women face additional discrimination and extremely high levels of violence.</p>
<p>One of Tank Girl&#8217;s members, Sareena Rai, is involved in two other feminist DIY punk bands, <a title="Rai Ko Ris" href="http://diypunknepal.blogspot.com.au/2011/06/short-interview-with-rai-ko-ris.html " target="_blank">Rai Ko Ris</a> and <a title="Nepal" href="ttp://subcultatlas.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/nepal-stories-from-nepal.html " target="_blank">Naya Faya</a>, and works to help Dalit women to protect themselves from gender-based violence, delivering self-defence training in her house. Which is pretty awesome.</p>
<h2>Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia</h2>
<p>I found a few more Asia-Pacific riot grrrl bands, including the adorable <a title="Youtube - Fatal Posporos" href="http://youtu.be/exu28Xt3Trs" target="_blank"><strong>Fatal Posporos</strong></a> from the Philippines and <a title="Myspace - Pretty Riot" href="http://www.myspace.com/prettyriot09 " target="_blank"><strong>Pretty Riot</strong></a> from Indonesia. As well as bands <a title="Hellsister" href="http://ohmytracks.com/#/music/Hellsister" target="_blank"><strong>Hellsister</strong></a> and <a title="Myspace - Dance On Your Grave" href="http://www.myspace.com/doygmusic" target="_blank"><strong>Dance On Your Grave</strong></a>, the scene in Malaysia was (and hopefully still is) large enough to support a zine distro called <a title="Grrrl:Rebel" href="http://grrrlzines.net/interviews/grrrlrebel.htm" target="_blank"><strong>Grrrl:Rebel</strong></a>. “Through zines, people in the scene are much more exposed to stuffs that were somewhat limited to them and the public before” founder Carol told <a title="Grrrzines" href="http://grrrlzines.net/" target="_blank">GrrrlZines.net</a> in 2001. “In countries like Malaysia and Singapore, you would get arrested if you write any articles that can be considered as threats to the government.”</p>
<p>It&#8217;s comments like that which I find so remarkable, dropped into interviews about the role of girls in the punk scene and the best local bands which could kind of be about anywhere.</p>
<h2>Africa and the Middle East</h2>
<p>While I couldn&#8217;t find any trace of a riot grrrl scene in Africa, I did happen upon a 2011 documentary called <a title="Afropop - Punk In Africa" href="http://www.afropop.org/wp/6866/punk-in-africa/" target="_blank"><strong>Punk In Africa</strong></a> which sounds good. And in the Middle East, grrrls are thin on the ground, but judging from the cracking <a title="MidEast Tunes" href="http://mideastunes.com/" target="_blank">MidEastTunes</a> website there are plenty of women active in dark metal and goth, including Bahrain&#8217;s first all-girl metal band <a title="LA Times - Scarlet Tear" href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/babylonbeyond/2010/08/bahrain-.html" target="_blank"><strong>Scarlet Tear</strong></a>.</p>
<h2>Mexico, Venezuela and Brazil</h2>
<p>South America does seem to have a sizeable riot grrrl base &#8211; my cursory search turned up bands in Mexico, Venezuela, Chile, Colombia and Argentina. <a title="Myspace - Le Butcherettes" href="http://www.myspace.com/lebutcherettes " target="_blank"><strong>Le Butcherettes</strong></a> from Mexico are definitely worth a listen, and I&#8217;d like to find more by a Venezuelan skapunk outfit called <a title="Pure Volume - 7 Potencias" href="http://www.purevolume.com/7potencias" target="_blank"><strong>7 Potencias</strong></a> who have a song called &#8216;Feminista de Bolsillo&#8217;, which I&#8217;m led to believe translates as &#8216;Pocket Feminist&#8217;.</p>
<p>The biggest scene seems to be in Brazil, which boasts a huge list of bands and artists, including <a title="Myspace - Dominatrix" href="http://www.myspace.com/contatodominatrix" target="_blank"><strong>Dominatrix</strong></a>, <a title="Bandcamp - Siete Armas" href="http://sietearmas.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Siete Armas</strong></a> and <a title="Myspace - Bertha Lutz" href="http://www.myspace.com/bandaberthalutz" target="_blank"><strong>Bertha Lutz</strong></a>, with her irresistibly-titled track &#8216;Feminism? Yes Please!&#8217;.</p>
<p>Bit of context: while Brazil is the world&#8217;s sixth largest economy, there is still vast inequality. And although it currently has a female President for the first time in Dilma Rouseff, women make up just 8.6% of the seats in Parliament. Abortion is legal only to save a woman&#8217;s life or in cases of rape, and in 2010, it was <a title="Wikigender - Brazil" href="http://www.wikigender.org/index.php/Gender_Equality_in_Brazil" target="_blank">reported</a> that 200,000 women a year are hospitalized for complications of illegal abortion.</p>
<p>The reasons behind riot grrrl&#8217;s popularity in Brazil are even the subject of an <a title="Journals" href="http://journals.lib.washington.edu/index.php/intersections/article/view/9544" target="_blank">academic paper by Calla Hummel</a>, who recognises the political significance and adaptability of this particular bit of shouty youth culture:</p>
<blockquote><p>Brazilian riot grrrl is one of the sites where Western cultural hegemony is being called into question&#8230; As it moves across borders, riot grrrl becomes a form of transnational feminism – and grrrls must address how ideas and material originating in a given locale may resonate, change, or delegitimize ideas and work in another.</p></blockquote>
<p>Gender inequality is a global problem which varies in its expression across different cultural contexts. It&#8217;s not an &#8216;over there&#8217; issue, but in some places it&#8217;s more severe than in others. Similarly, riot grrrl anywhere is awesome, but the courage and kickassness of the grrrls in these bands is pretty inspiring.</p>
<p>As a band member called Isabella quoted by Hummel says:</p>
<blockquote><p>As long as we keep getting letters from the middle of the jungle, from a tiny, three person town in the Amazon, from some girl saying, &#8216;Feminism saved my life, thank you,&#8217; we will keep doing it.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last year we marked <a href="http://www.internationalwomensday.com/">International Women&#8217;s Day</a> with <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/03/08/bring-back-the-parade/">a personal post</a> from a team member who talked about living and working in countries where it is, or has been, celebrated in different ways.</p>
<p>This year I asked some of the team to give a shout-out to a relevant project, organisation or intiative.</p>
<div style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/international_womens_day_vector.jpg?resize=500%2C500" alt="red 8 for 8th March made of red flower graphics.

<p><strong>Sarah J: </strong> I&#8217;m being a bit cheeky and flagging up something that the charity I work for are doing for International Women&#8217;s Day. Womankind Worldwide is hosting a virtual march around the globe to celebrate the international women&#8217;s movement, raise awareness of the incredible work our partners do and remind feminists in the UK that we&#8217;re part of a powerful, global force for change.</p>
<p>We’ve added an interactive map of the world to our website, with a counter showing how far the march has travelled around the world and how many people have taken part. For everyone that signs up the marker moves 10 miles forward. We need about 2,500 people to get all the way round!</p>
<p>Please stop by <a href="www.womankind.org.uk/world">www.womankind.org.uk/world</a> to join the march, and show our partners working for women’s rights in Africa, Asia and Latin America that you are with them. You can also leave a message of support for the activists we work with on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/womankind">our Facebook page</a> or by sending us a tweet (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/woman_kind">@woman_kind</a>) &#8211; we will pass all of them on.</p>
<p><strong>Sarah C: </strong><a href="http://joinmeonthebridge.org/profile/WomenforWomenInternational">JOIN ME ON THE BRIDGE</a>! On 8th March, <a href="http://joinmeonthebridge.org/profile/WomenforWomenInternational" target="_blank">Women for Women International</a> are asking you to join them on the bridge. All kinds of bridges. All around the UK (there&#8217;s a <a href="http://joinmeonthebridge.org/events" target="_blank">list of events here</a>). Why bridges?  Well, it&#8217;s about building bridges &#8211; geddit? &#8211; and proclaiming messages of peace. They are inviting everyone to come and participate or register their own event. I love events like this that reach out across the whole world and make connections. As well as events structured around a good pun.</p>
<p>The key thing for me here is that S word, solidarity. I often rail against the idea that all women need to do such-and-such a thing because they are women or assigned-female-bodied, cos that&#8217;s, you know, sexist. But that people &#8211; of whatever shape or gender &#8211; could get together and show support for women around the world, for a couple of hours, at least? That&#8217;s drawing attention to inequality. And as they&#8217;ve put it on their Mission Statement: &#8220;On International Women&#8217;s Day, 8 March, thousands of people will show that they are with the women of Afghanistan, Iraq, Congo, Rwanda, South Sudan and other war-torn countries.&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>Hannah:</strong> The organisation I&#8217;d like to give a big shout-out to is <a href="http://www.southallblacksisters.org.uk/">Southall Black Sisters</a>, an organisation by and for Black and Asian women which began in 1979 in the aftermath of the death of Blair Peach (an anti-facist protestor who died from police violence). Since then SBS has changed and expanded its remit to fit the needs of those around it &#8211; specifically as advocates of womens&#8217; rights, supporting women suffering from domestic violence and campaigning against religious fundamentalism. The role of SBS as a support group especially for ethnic minority women is especially important as women of colour often face different pressures (see their forced marriages campaign) and specialised services are needed.</p>
<p>Southall Black Sisters first came to my attention at a London Feminist Network meeting in 2010 and they&#8217;re regulars at Fawcett Society gatherings and marches, too. Their speakers have always been bright, warm, engaging and utterly unwavering in their points, unfazed by the battles they have ahead. Working at grassroots level, the SBS have their fingers on the pulse and report to people in power &#8211; they have been invited to speak at the Home Office and the UN.</p>
<p>In 2007 SBS faced funding cuts from Ealing Council which would have closed all SBS&#8217;s operations. The council claimed argued that their services were no longer necessary due to &#8216;Social Cohesion&#8217; &#8211; SBS fought this in the high court citing the Race Relations Act and their victory has set a legal precedent for other ethnic minority support groups facing cuts &#8211; an especially important victory as so many charities and support networks are squeezed and so many women and ethnic minorities feel the force of the cuts deeper them others.</p>
<p><strong>Me (Miranda):</strong> Following on from that, I&#8217;m gonna get on my political crate for a moment here too and mention that International Women&#8217;s Day has its roots in socialism. It was founded by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clara_Zetkin">Clara Zetkin</a> under the name International Working Women&#8217;s Day. It came from the labour movements at the turn of the twentieth century, and in a year when government cuts have put women at a <a href="http://fawcettsociety.org.uk/index.asp?PageID=1264">twenty-five year high for unemployment figures</a>, I think this is something that it pays to bear in mind. Opposing these cuts &#8211; to our NHS, to our jobs, to our libraries, to our working lives &#8211; is vital as far as I&#8217;m concerned because they <em>enforce and underline systemic inequalities</em> and limit our power to do something about them. Denise Marshall <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2011/feb/15/women-refuge-chief-protest-cuts">handed back her OBE</a> just over a year ago on this very point.</p>
<p>All of which is to say: nope, Dave, SHAN&#8217;T &#8220;calm down, dear&#8221; and my recommended Thing I Am Doing is probably &#8220;yelling at Parliament about these cuts at every possible opportunity&#8221; because I believe that absolutely is a feminist issue &#8211; the NHS for example is a major employer of women, of whom I am one, aside from the obvious issue of service cuts! In terms of being more specifically-IWD, there&#8217;s also the <a href="http://www.wrc.org.uk/">Women&#8217;s Resource Centre</a>, and as has been well documented, I really dig the <a href="http://www.theredpumpproject.org/">Red Pump Project</a> over in the USA.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>What are you doing this IWD? </em></li>

					<description><![CDATA[My response to the people who seriously typed that line on International Women's Day: stop hijacking every single goddamn thread about real issues with this inane question, there's work to do!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most people who read feminist blogs won&#8217;t even need me to explain this title. We see it every day.</p>
<p><strong>International Women&#8217;s Day</strong> on the 8th of March turned Twitter into an amazing parade of support for women, delight in their progress towards equality and celebration of the women in each of our lives.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, it was business as usual. If you could have hashtagged &#8220;<em>Why don&#8217;t men get a day, EH?</em>&#8221; then it&#8217;d have been the global number one tag all over the internet. (They do get a day &#8211; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Men's_Day">November 19th</a> &#8211; but that&#8217;s not my point here.) I&#8217;m writing this post so that next year I can just link it every time someone tells me feminism &#8220;isn&#8217;t needed&#8221; or is unfair to men in some way.</p>
<p>To the people (all of whom were men) who had to ask me what the title of this post meant: look at almost any online article about women&#8217;s rights or feminism. Chances are within the first few comments you will have a man asking &#8220;What about men&#8217;s rights?&#8221;</p>
<p>As <a href="www.weareequals.org">the James Bond clip which did the rounds</a> quotes: &#8220;Women perform 66% of the world&#8217;s work, earn 10% of world&#8217;s income and own 1% of the world&#8217;s property.&#8221; What about the men? Fine. Let&#8217;s reverse that for a new quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Men perform 33% of the world&#8217;s work, earn 90% of world&#8217;s income and own 99% of the world&#8217;s property.</p></blockquote>
<p>They also suffer much less domestic violence, rape, genital mutilation, sexual shame, sex trafficking, and have far more control over their lives and bodies.  Their options for work aren&#8217;t limited, they are not considered to automatically have a duty to represent their whole gender if they reach the top of a profession or political office, and aren&#8217;t scrutinised as mercilessly if their partner does.</p>
<p>They don&#8217;t face becoming part of the epidemic of rape during war, having their testimony count for half a man&#8217;s in court, legal challenges on precisely how much they are allowed to be beaten before it&#8217;s not acceptable, they&#8217;re far less likely to face <em>being property</em>, victims of honour killings and acid attacks, or living under social or legal pressure to hide their bodies from sight (or the more familiar pressure in the UK to expose them, provided they&#8217;re the &#8216;correct&#8217; shape, if they want to be successful).</p>
<p>Speaking as a white cis male in a first world country,  if you can&#8217;t see why feminism &#8216;is still needed&#8217; globally then you haven&#8217;t tried looking for even a second. We may have a different set of inequalities at home, but that doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re not just as pervasive and damaging in society. Is the UK some amazing bastion of freedom where women have no problems anymore? <a href="http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/human-rights/international-womens-day-2011/how-fair-is-britain-for-women/">The Equality and Human Rights Commission says a BIG no.</a></p>
<p>Other people raised a much more valid secondary point during International Women&#8217;s Day, which was the hesitation a lot of men have about the <em>word</em> &#8216;feminism&#8217;. Even though the movement is about seeking equality, the term <em>suggests</em> seeking female superiority to a lot of people. It&#8217;s been debated constantly in feminist circles, but we sometimes forget that this instinctive mis-definition hasn&#8217;t changed in the minds of many of the mainstream. The argument about reclaiming it (and then making the version we want actually take root in the general public) is a whole post on its own, and not what I want to do here. <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/03/07/what-does-feminism-look-like/">We know that feminism has an image problem.</a></p>
<p>For our readers (of any gender) who may be in doubt, here is my personal definition: feminism is about womens&#8217; right to live as human beings. To make choices about their own lives and bodies. Things which we would consider imprisonment or torture on &#8216;a person&#8217; are inflicted on women every day, and equality is not going to happen without a lot of effort to fight that status quo. Reaching equality doesn&#8217;t take anything away from men that we should not be ashamed of and glad to lose anyway.</p>
<p>We <em>haven&#8217;t</em> gained this balance yet in the UK, and we&#8217;re catastrophically nowhere near it internationally.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not just the men who need to learn this. I have several stories from female friends where it is <em>women</em> who are enforcing the partriachal norms on other women most harshly. Everyone has a long way to go before we get a situation which is more equal.</p>
<p>Can you seriously ask &#8220;What about the men?&#8221; Get the depressing stats on inequality: that 92%  of our judges in the UK are white men from Oxford / Cambridge, that&#8230; look, this  could go on forever.</p>
<p>In Egypt (where they recently had a revolution, with women very much involved at the front of it) they had the parades for International Women&#8217;s Day which have become traditional in many parts of the world.  The women in the parade were heckled and threatened by men chanting anti-female slogans.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Men chanting against us were very furious. It offended them that we were calling for equal rights. &#8230; They were chanting &#8220;Down with Women&#8221;.</strong><br />
<em>&#8211; @Egyptocracy on twitter</em></p></blockquote>
<p>There are reports of violence, including sexual assaults. A comment from <strong>Equality Now</strong>&#8216;s Facebook page: <em>&#8220;That Egyptian women &#8230; grow up *expecting* to be fondled in public as a form of intimidation is just gut-wrenching.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>The main direction of this post will not be new to most feminists, and every area I&#8217;ve mentioned deserves a huge amount of debate, but I wanted to write something specifically for those people who can in all seriousness still ask &#8220;What about the men?&#8221;</p>
<p>Forget that question. There are very valid problems which are uniquely facing men in modern society, and <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/12/16/big-dog/">I think some of them must be solved if we are to make progress in feminism</a>, but really, my response to the people who seriously typed that line on International Women&#8217;s Day: stop hijacking every single goddamn thread about real issues with this inane question, there&#8217;s work to do!</p>

<p>One of my oldest memories as a small child in Bulgaria is making a fuss over my mother on International Women&#8217;s Day. I remember making cards in school, and learning poems, and generally being really impatient to grow up so I would get to have a fuss made over me, too. Sure, there was Children&#8217;s Day, but it wasn&#8217;t a patch on Women&#8217;s Day. They got a bloody parade. A parade! Soon I, too, would grow up, and get to have a parade. Or possibly a statue. I hadn&#8217;t decided.</p>
<p>Of course, my innocent dreams of grandeur were all for nought. A few years later we moved to the UK, and Women&#8217;s Day was banished to a vague memory of communism and its weird ideas. I got Mothering Sunday instead. The first time I opted for Mothering Sunday flowers and brunch instead of the usual Women&#8217;s Day, my mother thought I&#8217;d forgotten and burst into tears. Explaining I&#8217;d switched allegiance to a movable feast instead of a fixed day didn&#8217;t seem to win me many fans. And my father seemed relieved that he didn&#8217;t have to observe it, since, he pointed out, she was his wife and not his mother.</p>
<p>Now, look. Those first tremulous years of transition were admittedly ropey, and it took a while for everyone to settle into their assigned roles. Mum yields to brunches and jewellery more easily now, and hasn&#8217;t demanded a formal poem or performative dance for the longest time. And my brother just signs his name next to mine on the card. But that&#8217;s not really the point.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m starting to think we shouldn&#8217;t have made the transition in the first place. International Women&#8217;s Day was a celebration of being female, and an acknowledgement of women&#8217;s roles and contributions to society. One of the famous women we learned about in school was <a title="Valentina Tereshkova" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentina_Tereshkova">Valentina Tereshkova</a> (sans tragic end), and I remember presenting my school teacher with a carefully constructed posy to acknowledge her position as educator. Admittedly, this was all orchestrated and ultimately about the glory of communism, so there are problems with it. But despite all that, I took from those few years of observing Women’s Day a sense of pride at being female, and an impatience to be a woman.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s look at Mothering Sunday. Where to start? It&#8217;s a familial observance &#8211; you&#8217;re nice to your own mother to make up for setting the kitchen on fire that one time, and 24 hours of labour et cetera &#8211; and I&#8217;m under no obligation to be nice to any mothers I meet on my way home. Especially if they&#8217;re pushing those 4&#215;4 buggies. Also, it&#8217;s a presents-and-flowers day, where you buy gifts to show appreciation for being born and suckled and generally not dropped on your head. No one is actually expecting you to do anything differently the next day, your duties discharged with a pink book on frills and a wilted bouquet.</p>
<p>Finally &#8211; and perhaps damningly &#8211; it only acknowledges one aspect of femininity. Mothering Sunday elevates mothering to the pinnacle of womanhood. What happens if your mother &#8211; much as you love her &#8211; just isn&#8217;t very good at this mothering malarkey? She tries her best, but curing cancer or trekking across the Arctic takes up a lot of time. I&#8217;m betting she feels a little silly looking at that cat illustration now.</p>
<p>There are other problems. What about other women you owe great debts of gratitude to? What about the grandmothers, aunts, stepmothers, big sisters, best friends, teachers, mentors and supporters who cheerlead you throughout your life? Maybe we should have a separate day for each of them. I, for one, am looking forward to observing Second Cousin Twice Removed Day. They always threw the best parties.</p>
<p>I find it problematic to have motherhood as the only aspect of womanhood that is nationally acknowledged. I find it problematic to have motherhood as a system of gratitude predicated upon familial links, rather than as an acknowledgement by society as a whole. Finally, I find it bloody annoying that my own accomplishments will not be acknowledged or celebrated by anyone, least of all in a parade. Quite frankly, sometimes I think that I &#8211; and all the amazing women I see around me &#8211; deserve a parade. And why not? It happens elsewhere in the world. Two years ago I was in the small town of Po, in southern Burkina Faso, on 8<sup>th</sup> March. The reason I was wandering around the country and not busy with an abacus is because International Women’s Day is a Bank Holiday there. <a title="8th March around the world" href="http://www.bank-holidays.com/selectday_3_8.htm">And not just there.</a></p>

<p>In China, Russia and large parts of Africa, International Women’s Day still flourishes.  Even in places such as Iran<a title="8 March 2007 in Iran" href="http://hammerandbroom.blogspot.com/2007/03/iranian-students-celebrate-march-8-2007.html"> there are still people eager to celebrate women&#8217;s contributions</a> and to show solidarity.  There are still parades, and recitals, and girls waiting impatiently to grow up and have a day to be proud of being female. You could argue that, in the UK, many women would feel proud of being female much more often than that. You could point towards exam results, or women’s achievements, or women’s contribution to UK society.</p>
<p>You’d be wrong, I think. Of course, women achieve all of these things in the UK, and more. But when are these achievements acknowledged or celebrated?</p>
<p>When they give birth &#8211; and, a few months later, get their first pink Mother’s Day card.</p>
<p>Keep your cards and glitter pens. Bring back the parades.</p>
