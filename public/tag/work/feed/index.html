					<description><![CDATA[If I arrive tomorrow at work with a ‘male’ business suit on, will I be taken more seriously? Am I feminine enough for the office if I don’t wear flawless makeup – or any makeup? ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dress codes (the set of ‘rules’ that govern what we wear in specific situations) are present in every facet of our daily lives, whether explicitly stated or inherently assumed. For this article, there’s only one dress code I want to talk about: what you wear at work.</p>
<div id="attachment_11750" style="width: 269px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/mcdonalds.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11750" data-attachment-id="11750" data-permalink="/2012/08/02/office-work-it/mcdonalds/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/mcdonalds.jpg?fit=324%2C449&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="324,449" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="mcdonalds" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/mcdonalds.jpg?fit=216%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/mcdonalds.jpg?fit=324%2C449&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-11750 " title="mcdonalds" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/mcdonalds.jpg?resize=259%2C359" alt="Promo shots for McDonald's uniforms.

<p>The working ‘uniform’ is ubiquitous to a huge number of professions, despite the possibility that many of us associate it first and foremost with the service industries. By service industries, I don’t mean simply <a href="http://www.yumsugar.com/New-McDonalds-Uniforms-Love-Hate-1578851">McDonald’s workers</a>, Tesco employees or the like; service means serving you (the consumer) through labour. Retail fashion workers are a prime example, where the ‘uniform’ may not be a classic sweatshirt-and-trousers combo, but rather items picked solely from the collection of garments that the shop provides – living mannequins, in a sense. But this is getting way ahead of myself; let’s go back a bit.</p>
<p>Wearing a uniform, as so many <a href="http://debatemate.wordpress.com/2010/11/19/this-house-would-ban-school-uniforms/">sixth form debates have pointed out</a>, has both positive and negative effects on the individual and the group in any given institution. School uniform has the apparent benefit of making everyone equal (at least, visually) while at the same time ensuring creative idiosyncratic fashion choices are made in the smallest details; how many buttons are done up, how the tie is tied, what badges you wear and the jewellery you sneak in. Even in a photo that has been <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/green-living-blog/2010/aug/23/school-uniforms-cheap-ethical-concerns">posed for this<strong> Guardian</strong> piece</a>, the same uniform turns up in many different styles. So what about the uniform at work? I’ve worked in enough poorly-paid retail jobs to realise what the proposed function of a uniform is, and what actually happens when you wear it.</p>
<p>Just like at school, a uniform is meant to show that all the wearers are equal – visually. For the consumer, workers are identified by what they are wearing; many a time I have been asked in various shops where the changing rooms are, because my particular garb is close enough to the ‘uniform’ of a retail fashion worker to confuse the consumer (although mostly this happens in charity shops. I’m down with that). Workers are set apart from consumers and grouped together as labour through their uniform.</p>
<p>However, looking the same and being the same are (duh) different. My manager and I wear the same uniform: shirt, trousers, and name badge – but are we the same? No. She’s the <em>manager</em>; she’s my boss. Confusing messages of similarity (and potential solidarity?) and hidden hierarchies abound with the working uniform, especially in retail sectors where more than one hierarchy is on the ‘working floor’. You might be able to argue that those industries in which workers are physically grouped by hierarchy – like the factory floor, where the manager is not as physically ‘present’ as on the shop floor – are able to recognise the uniform’s messages of similarity and solidarity more effectively than those where workers of disparate hierarchies are bundled in together.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://bobbypinblog.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/vintage-beautician-uniforms-and-smocks.html">Bobby Pin</a>, these are 1950s beauty salon uniforms:</p>

For this author, they’re utterly beautiful. But then I am a total sucker for ‘the giant coachman collar’.</p></div>
<p>As well as hierarchy being hidden (but strangely elaborated too, I suppose, by its hiddenness), gender too, is at least under an attempted disguise through the wearing of uniforms. Gone are the days of <strong>Mad Men</strong>, where women wore skirts and men wore trousers – now we <em>all</em> have to wear trousers, and horrible polo shirts too. An apparently gender-neutral uniform is provided in a number of sectors (mine was previously white shirt and black trousers – or skirt) that never really successfully disguises gender to the consumer in the same way that it conceals hierarchy to some extent. One-size-fits-all doesn’t work, especially if the size is designed for someone who doesn’t have breasts.</p>

Or, at least, they don’t tell you that you have a uniform. Explicitly, the dress code might be not much more than ‘no shorts or clogs’, but implicitly, the dress code will be bending and morphing round the individuals who are adhering to and working against it. This dress code will tie in gender and authority hierarchies, as illustrated by the business suit and its female equivalent.</p>
<p>From my employment experience (and others who have agreed with me), men wear business suits, but women do not wear business suits, despite this (again) apparently gender-neutral ‘uniform’ being available. A number of women working in offices might wear the <a href="http://www.next.co.uk/women/tailored-looks">female equivalent of the business suit</a> (Next surely embodies this look), which more often than not includes a) skirt b) something frilly c) front-cover-flawless makeup. So it’s the business suit, plus a) traditional emblem of femininity b) annoying and impractical emblem of femininity c) emblem of femininity that is often perceived to be caused by heavy external pressures to look good at all times. The visual ‘uniform’ of the business suit is not gender-neutral, because it is adapted to become gender-specific; whether this is due to individual taste or workplace culture, I’m unsure, but it does inform the hierarchy of the office.</p>

Love. Her.</p></div>The dress code in some offices (especially creative industries) is not always specified explicitly; you might not have to wear a suit, you could wear jeans whenever you please, and if you want to turn up <a href="http://www.rad80sfashion.com/cyndi-lauper.htm">dressed like Cyndi Lauper</a>, by gum you can do. However, the adage of ‘dress for the job you want, not the job you have’ rings in my ears; you can do all those things, but will doing so damage employment opportunities because you haven’t adhered to the implicit dress code? Inter-departmental hierarchies are neatly displayed in adherence to or ignorance of the implicit dress code; if all the workers who were lower paid began to wear the business suits of those who are highest paid, would you be able to see a more democratic office?</p>
<p>Rather than looking at personal comments regarding taste that may be made about office workwear, my interest instead lies in how this implicit dress code dramatically affects the hierarchical makeup of a working environment, potentially without many of the individuals involved even being fully aware of how it is being shaped around them. If I arrive tomorrow at work with a ‘male’ business suit on, will I be taken more seriously? Or, as a woman, if I arrive in a simulated version of that ‘male’ business suit, will I be declined respect because I appear too much like one of the boys? Am I feminine enough for the office if I don’t wear flawless makeup – or any makeup? If I start dressing like the big boys, will they still know it’s me on the inside? I believe there is a definite question of sexuality and sexual preference here that comes into play with ‘levels’ of femininity in the workplace, although I don’t feel able to tackle this in great detail here (or just yet).</p>
<p>Workplace hierarchies are constituted through a vast number of factors, but the role of dress and dress codes is one that can’t be ignored. From traditional environments where gender and authority hierarchies may have been distinguished and designated by an explicit uniform placed upon the workers, contemporary working environments – especially those in the creative industries – now have to juggle with an implicit dress code that is created and defined by the workers themselves (across all hierarchies) in their clothing choices. Plus, there is the added element of workers’ perception of the importance of that dress code or, conversely, the desire to play with it and break some boundaries, in designating what you can, or can’t, wear to work.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I think shame is often strongly gendered; we are intended to feel it when we don't live up to our society's imposed, sexist expectations.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over 4 million people have seen <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCvmsMzlF7o">Brené Brown&#8217;s fantastic TED talk about Vulnerability</a>. She&#8217;s a researcher who looked into what successful people have in common, and found that they were all willing to make themselves vulnerable.</p>
<p>I was excited when she gave a follow-up talk in March, but I didn&#8217;t imagine I&#8217;d be posting about it on BadRep. The reason I am is that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psN1DORYYV0#t=15m0s">at 15.00 minutes</a>, it became ALL about gender. (I strongly recommend you check it out &#8211; both videos are excellent):</p>
<p>[<A href="http://youtu.be/psN1DORYYV0">We&#8217;re having trouble with embedding! Click this handy link instead!</a>]</p>
<p>Shame is often strongly gendered; we are intended to feel it when we don&#8217;t live up to our society&#8217;s imposed, sexist expectations. She cites a study from Boston College which got women to answer the question:</p>
<blockquote><p>What do women need to do to conform to female norms?</p></blockquote>
<p>The answers were: be Nice, Thin, Modest&#8230; and &#8216;Use all available resources for appearance&#8217;.</p>
<p>For men, they were: Always show emotional control, Work should be your priority, Pursue status&#8230; and &#8216;Violence&#8217;.</p>
<p>That they&#8217;re different answers for men and women should be enough to prove the need for some real changes in our society by itself, but that the actual points are also so disgusting just seals it for me. Nice. Thin. Don&#8217;t make a fuss. Physical appearance is everything. Emotionally cut off. Violent. Competitive. Judged hugely by job and status. <em>Not one of these things is good for society.</em> We could lose them all and it would only improve everyone&#8217;s lives. (Well, &#8216;nice&#8217; could be okay, if it were applied to the <em>more</em> powerful groups in society, but in terms of gender you&#8217;ve then still got the &#8216;chivalry&#8217; problem &#8211; that men can forget about power differences <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/01/25/keep-the-gift-pay-what-you-owe/">if they treat women &#8216;nicely&#8217;</a> while giving up nothing.)</p>
<p>Brown&#8217;s previous point had been that successful and happy people have to allow themselves the risk of being seen as weak, or to fail. However, in reaching that conclusion (and it&#8217;s definitely true), she only interviewed women. In this second talk she relates how a male fan pointed out to her that men often feel unable to choose this route.</p>
<blockquote><p>Shame feels the same for men and women, but it is organised by gender&#8230; </p>
<p>For men, shame is not a bunch of competing, conflicting expectations [as it is for women], shame is one: Do Not Be Perceived As Weak. </p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>Brené Brown</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The fan claims that it&#8217;s the women in his family who reinforce this for him. In terms of how strictly the two sets of &#8216;norms-to-conform-to&#8217; listed above are enforced, I often see that men have a lot more leeway in dropping one or two of them&#8230; but only if they replace them with &#8216;money&#8217;.</p>
<p>So the next time I&#8217;m looking for a shorthand example for why feminism is important, I&#8217;ll reference what people perceive as the <em>biggest</em> demands by society on who they are allowed to be. It&#8217;s a flawed, gender-binary test, but the fact that the public returned those answers counts for a lot. That a list so gendered and outrightly harmful to society should be the TOP pressures many of us seem to be facing is something we just don&#8217;t need. It may not be set in law, but <a href="http://nothingbutawordbag.wordpress.com/2012/04/22/gendered-marketing-really-gets-on-my-tits/" />this stuff is a strong daily message</a>.</p>
<p>&#8230;Which makes me want to find a solution. Well, first to scream F*** THAT and opt out, and <em>then</em> find a solution. Equality means removing this heinous bullshit for <em>everyone</em>. The goals listed as the top answers in that survey are both unattainable in size and harmful in practice, but what choice do we have? It&#8217;s fine for me to urge people to stop conforming, but for many if they do the reality is they&#8217;ll never pass a job interview again. (Although <a href="http://vagendamag.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/hair-not-musical.html">not shaving your armpits or legs sometimes works out just fine</a>). </p>
<p>I refuse to give up. Reducing inequality towards any gender is so fundamental to everyone&#8217;s happiness that stuff like this just makes me more determined to keep fighting: we&#8217;ve all got to keep educating each other, pushing for change and making the issues visible. Whether it&#8217;s about who they marry, if they have sex, issues of consent, or who their political leaders are, women have a lot less freedom than men <a href="http://www.womankind.org.uk/policy-and-resources/">internationally</a>. That&#8217;s not in dispute. Gender inequality is measurable. If you really can&#8217;t see it, you haven&#8217;t spent two seconds looking. Yes, I&#8217;m also concerned with the pressures sexism places on men, and I think these &#8216;norm lists&#8217; showcase exactly why there&#8217;s so much still to do for everybody.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A while ago I popped down to the post office to collect a large parcel. Inside the cardboard box, nestled amidst plastic frames more akin to Airfix than to heavy machinery, were around 150 separate parts that the instructions promised would fit together into a workable model of an internal combustion engine. This model would be step one in <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/category/toolbox/">the great <em>Let’s Rebuild an Engine! </em>project of 2011</a> in our BadRep household.</p>
<p>I had already recruited one colleague to help with the eventual engine rebuild, and she would therefore be present for the assembly of the model. The instructions promised that a 10-year-old would be able to put this together with a little adult supervision. Surely that meant that two 20-somethings should be able to manage it?</p>
<p>Of course, prior to assembly, we had to purchase a few things that did not come as standard in the kit. The first was batteries. The second was beer.</p>

<p>Alcohol and batteries thus acquired, we put in our takeaway order and opened up the box. Out spilled plastic heaven. A million fiddly parts attached to plastic frames, with tiny numbers on the frames indicating the part numbers. The manual would instruct us on how to assemble it. It also named all the parts, so hopefully we would learn the names of at least some of the moving bits and pieces by the end.</p>
<p>Things started off pretty well. We had <strong>Top Gear</strong>’s Africa adventure on the telly and the pistons/crankshaft assembly in the cylinder block, and the pistons made satisfying up-down movements when you turned the crankshaft. The instructions said that you needed sanding paper to get the edges of the plastic smooth, but as we lacked sandpaper we made do with nail files, which seemed to do the trick. The whole thing turned so smoothly that we didn’t even need the vegetable oil to make it work.</p>
<p>“This would be even better if it was the right size,” I said as the plastic innards were slowly swallowed up inside the model.</p>
<p>“That would be much more satisfying,” Colleague X agreed, trying to get the tiny screw to stay perched atop the tiny screwdriver, and slot the entire thing into the tiny hole on the side of the crankcase. “This feels more like keyhole surgery.”</p>
<p>“Which is also important.”</p>
<p>“Yes. But not the sort of thing I had in mind when I bought the six-pack.”</p>
<p>I, too, was getting a little restless. Earlier that week I had opened my planner to try to book a last-minute meeting with a senior colleague. He, peering over my shoulder, wanted to know what “Engine Build” was referring to, and why it had so many exclamation marks. I attempted to explain.</p>
<p>“Hmmm,” he said, frowning. “Yes, interesting. But an engine’s a big commitment. Did you think about starting with something a little smaller?”</p>
<p>A motorcycle? Sure. Ultimately, though, I’d decided on the engine, because I was learning to drive a car, not a bike.</p>
<p>“No, not a motorcycle,” he said, just as thoughtfully. “Something smaller. A lawnmower, maybe, or a hairdryer.”</p>
<p>I very pointedly did NOT stab him with his own pen, but instead said that we were doing a model version first.</p>
<p>“Yes,” he said. “I think that’s probably for the best.”</p>
<p>Anyway, other than patience and tact when faced with senior people and their hairdryer suggestions, what did I learn from doing this little side-project?</p>
<p>Firstly, it’s bloody cool. There’s now a little engine model on a shelf in my living room, and if you press the little button it lights up and makes happy engine noises.</p>
<p>Secondly, the instructions may well be wrong. Try the different bits together until they fit. This will probably be more useful that memorising engine layouts.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the reviews and advertising for this product piss me off something chronic. “<a title="Amazon review" href="//www.amazon.co.uk/Haynes-Combustion-Engine/dp/B0045RAJ14/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1297713005&amp;sr=8-7">Ideal for a dad and son project</a>,” one proclaims. Well, yes, it is, but it’s also ideal for a dad-and-daughter and mum-and-son project. Or mum-and-daughter. It’s basically model assembly, and doing this with a kid (without taking over and finishing it off yourself) would probably take an afternoon.</p>
<p>Fourthly, the rocker arm assembly fits on top of the valves and the camshaft, and there’s only one correct way of lining up all the cams on the camshaft. There is no obvious way of knowing what that way is without having them labelled in alphabetical order. (This may require a textbook. Or a mechanic.)</p>
<p>Finally, although doing the plastic model was fun, it is limited in several major areas. It is extremely simplified, for one thing. The water-pump is two bits of plastic moulded and snapped together. The ‘sparkplugs’ are tiny Christmas tree lights that light up according to the position of the crankshaft (so the position does have to be correct, and the wiring is a bit tricky, but it’s not actually how a spark plug works). The dipstick is a completely pointless clip-on piece of plastic that looks like a Barbie accessory, and I still have no idea what it does (although presumably you dip it in things).</p>

<p>You also get the feeling that filing tiny bits of plastic with a nail file is not precisely what engine maintenance is all about. (Although it may well involve nail files. At this stage I have no way of knowing.) Assembling the model did make me more familiar with a lot of the parts, and I think I understand the fundamentals. But it felt a bit… delicate. A lot of the parts were so tiny that you had to hold them by the tips of your fingers, and slot them into place using your nails. It’s the same problem as following a textbook: it’s too clean. I didn’t start this wanting to stay in my living room, with clean fingers and a perfect working model completed in a couple of hours. I want something that will take months and leave me exhausted and exasperated and absolutely triumphant when it is in fact finished.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Colleague X and I sat back and contemplated the finished product while James May and Richard Hammond performed emergency surgery on Oliver in the background.</p>
<p>“Well,” she said eventually, “it’s very nice.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said. I pushed the button again, and we watched the pistons move up and down and the little lights pretend to be sparkplugs. “Shall we build the real thing?”</p>
<p>“Let’s.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My model engine has arrived!</p>
<p>Let me tell you about it. It is a simplified, reasonably accurate version of a four-stroke engine, and it comes with its very own Haynes manual. It’s also entirely plastic and aimed at ages 10+. Bollocks, I say. If I had kids that age, I wouldn’t let them anywhere near the thing with their wickedly sharp craft knives. They&#8217;d have their fingers off before the first tea break.</p>

Like Airfix, only not.</p></div>
<p>Let me back up a bit. <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/02/17/secret-diary-of-a-female-petrolhead/">A few months ago, I decided that I was going to learn about engines.</a> I’ve always been a bit hazy on the theory behind internal combustion, and despite my father’s repeated attempts to explain, I’ve never really been able to get it straight in my head. This could have something to do with his insistence on explaining over the dinner table, rather than opening up the bonnet of his car and explaining there. (My brother got the lecture over the open bonnet of the car. <em>He</em> got so bored he fell asleep.)</p>
<p>This will all be a lot easier to grasp if I can actually do it myself. If I can take apart an engine and put it back together, you can be reasonably certain that I’ll know how it works afterwards. OK, maybe I’ll explode the back garden a couple of times, but I’ve accepted that as an inevitable consequence.</p>
<p>Miraculously, my new-found zeal is shared by a colleague of mine. She, too, wants to strip down an engine and see what makes it tick. Excellent! We ordered a plastic model to assemble in order to get a vague idea of what it will all involve, before thinking about taking things a little further. While we waited for the model to arrive, we may have become a little… unruly. Rowdy. Noisy. Obnoxious? Surely not!</p>
<p>After one of our exchanges, a colleague came up to me. She works in HR. You know the type: perfect hair, perfect nails, perfect smile. Was my enthusiasm too, er, enthusiastic?</p>
<p>“I just wanted to say, what you’re doing is fantastic,” she murmured quietly, and straightened the strand of pearls at her neck. “I love my car, I’d kill any fucker who so much as touched it. There’s nothing quite like a good engine purring, you know?”</p>
<p>I didn’t know, actually, but I nodded just the same.</p>
<p>The next day, another colleague was delivering some papers over my lunch hour when she saw the driving lessons website open in my browser. “Oh, are you learning to drive? Good for you! I learned in Nairobi, I thought I’d be quite frightened and sedate but it turned out I was a real girl racer, I nearly failed because I was speeding the entire time…”</p>
<p>I’m guessing that speeding will not be encouraged in London.</p>
<p>The next day, colleague Y came up to me, very upset, and drew me away from my desk. “I heard that you and colleague X are rebuilding an engine!” she said, looking very upset. Well, yes. Was this against her ethical beliefs? Was I in trouble with the ‘cycle to work’ initiative?</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you invite me?”</p>
<p>The thing is, I haven’t really mentioned this that much at work, despite being giddy with it for months. The people that have found out about it have either nodded sagely about how many times I&#8217;ll set myself on fire, or raved about how brilliant it all is. Invariably, my young female colleagues have fallen into the latter category. They’ve also taken the opportunity to ask me what I thought about the new Pagani (undecided, and I miss the Zonda R), the One-77 (I do like it, but why is it so angry? It looks like it’s been munching on stray pets) and plus, wouldn’t it be nice if the off-road vehicles didn’t kill your spine every time you went off road? (Seriously, Toyota, sort it out.) All of this was delivered in hushed tones over the tea and coffee, and by the time we were back at our desks we were very firmly back on either the Sudan referendum or the receptionist’s new hairstyle.</p>

<p>Why? Was what we were talking about so shocking that it wasn’t fit for general consumption? Would the office spontaneously explode if it turned out that the female accountants and aid workers in my organisation actually knew their Nissans from their Nobles? Why did they get so embarrassed talking about it?</p>
<p>“Well,” colleague X said philosophically, “I didn’t get into cars before because I thought that it was a traditional male thing. And that didn’t mean that I couldn’t do it, but blokes would know more about it than me starting off, and I didn’t want to feel stupid. Then it turned out that they knew just as little as I did.”</p>
<p>Two hours later, a male colleague decided to ask condescendingly what kind of engine we’d be rebuilding. Would it be, he said, sneering, a rotating one?</p>
<p>&#8220;A Wankel rotary?&#8221; I asked. No. It would be a four-stroke.</p>
