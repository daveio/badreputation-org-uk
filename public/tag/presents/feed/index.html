										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>A final taste of different sorts of feminists, their families and the festive season. This one is crowdsourced using an online survey from my own Twitter feed and also this website. Everyone was asked the same questions and given room to type whatever they wanted. I&#8217;ve selected a handful of quotes that I thought were interesting, relevant or in certain cases just made me smile or feel all festive&#8230; This means they are kinda jumbled, but I like that as it shows the commonalities, particularly the focus on our families &#8211; whatever they look like!</em></p>
<p><em>Needless to say, this sort of behaviour is why I will never be a proper writer or journalist.<br />
</em></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I celebrate Christmas as a practising Christian.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m originally from Poland. I&#8217;m not flying home this year because I don&#8217;t have any days off left because of my studies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a 23-year-old disabled feminist who lives alone in council housing.  I am unemployed due to my disability and spend a lot of my time homebound.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Too much to do w/ career/cuts this year to get involved in capitalistic nonsense this year. Merry Christmas!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Spending the weekend before Solstice with partners&#8217; parents and the rest of the Christmas time at home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I enjoy pink products! &#8230; But ideally, I&#8217;d like to be able to enjoy them were I male, too, without negative comment!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For various reasons we can&#8217;t get to our families, so we&#8217;re all doing Christmas together. We&#8217;re going to prep the food on Christmas Eve, then have dinner and stockings the next day, and generally be relaxed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have honestly never really considered Christmas as being stressful for feminists but that&#8217;s because my dad was always pretty involved and my partner does a lot of the cooking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I bought a card for my younger brother who is currently working in France because I know he&#8217;s getting homesick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Last year I wrote poems for the people closest to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will probably end up at my local arts centre, buying quirky crap.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I feel the need to try and take some pressure off my Mum because she always seems to get very worked up about Christmas, she has the longest holiday so has always done more of the preparation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The way children&#8217;s toys are so aggressively segregated by gender worries me and I often think about how I will work this when and if I  have children of my own.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Thank you to everyone who contributed &#8211; either by responding to my emails, phone calls and texts, posting on the survey or pinging me on Twitter. I&#8217;m always excited by the range of people who connect with BadRep and hope that you all have an awesome holiday! </em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>A few snapshots of different sorts of feminists, their families and the festive season. I’m fortunate to have lots of lovely people in my circle, many of whom identify as feminists and I was interested in what their Christmases looked like.</em></p>
<p><em>So, are you sitting comfortably? Then let’s continue&#8230;</em></p>
<p><strong>TELL ME A BIT ABOUT YOURSELF.</strong></p>
<p>My name is Lily and I&#8217;m a literature student, photographer and occasional event organiser of Crimson (a BDSM club) and Peer Rope London among other things. I&#8217;m 23 and have been with my boyfriend for almost five years and with my girlfriend for almost four (I&#8217;m polyamorous). I&#8217;malso pagan, as are my parents; something I don&#8217;t advertise overmuch,  but which may impact on the rest of this interview. I was born and grew up in London and am very close to my family, who live ten minutes away from us in Wimbledon.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS AT CHRISTMAS?</strong></p>
<p>For the last few years, we (my boyfriend and I) have had small Christmas celebrations by ourselves, except for a traditional walk on  the common with my family in the morning, then friends have come over in the evening. We usually see our girlfriend the week beforehand for  mini-christmasness; she spends the actual holiday with her primary partner. This year, however, we are hosting christmas for the first time for my family (mummy, dad and little brother). I&#8217;m cooking, not because  I <em>have</em> to, but because I love cooking for people and I get annoyed with other people in the kitchen really quickly! So, we will open stockings, go on our morning walk, open presents, chill out, have christmas dinner. Then more chilling out, a game of cluedo or something and then movies (Wallace and Gromit!), port and bedtime.  My family isn&#8217;t christian, so it&#8217;s never been about religion for us (we celebrate Yule instead); it&#8217;s a chance to celebrate the people you love, have a good time and take time out to spend with each other.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT HAVE YOU BOUGHT?</strong></p>
<p>Crabtree and Evelyn  rose perfume, chinese flying lanterns, shoes, wallet, a hat, a <a href="http://kigu.co.uk/">kigu</a>, a sparkly Virgin Mary, sparkling skulls, a recipe book, a Jedi bathrobe. I still have to get a couple of bits and pieces.</p>
<p><strong>HOW DO YOU BUY GIFTS?</strong></p>
<p>Online if I need something specific, <a href="http://www.etsy.com/">Etsy</a> for beautiful individual items  (I usually boycott Amazon, for LGBT and ethical reasons) and other independent shops, but otherwise I pick up curious little things when I see them in the shops. I like shopping for other people.</p>
<p><strong>AS A FEMINIST DO YOU FEEL ANY PARTICULAR PRESSURES OR RESPONSIBILITY AT THIS TIME OF YEAR?</strong></p>
<p>I feel a need to not be gender biased in my present giving. I tend to use <a href="http://www.hawkin.com/">Hawkins Bazaar</a> to get a lot of things (like the lanterns, sparkling skulls, etc), because they stock a range of stuff that isn&#8217;t  gender specific. They&#8217;re also great for kids as well as adults. I  despise most kids shops at this time of year, when everything is split into pink and blue; Early Learning Centre is a particular horror (and the <a href="http://pinkstinks.co.uk/">Pink Stinks</a> campaign highlights this), as is Hamleys with its split gendered floors (one for the girls and one for boys).</p>

<p>I actually was horrified by a couple of things in Hamleys, especially its <em>beauty bar</em> for girls, which offers pre-teens manicures etc, and is called <a href="http://www.yourtantrum.com/hamleys/"><em>Tantrum</em></a>.  And the fact that in order to market something to girls, you should  just take the normal toy and paint it pink. But if people ask for something or really love something which is gender specific (rose perfume for example) then I will get it, because that&#8217;s about preference not obligation.</p>
<p><strong>AND FINALLY&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>I think that a lot of pressure will come from family and social circles at this time of year, more so than the media. I dislike a lot of  adverts and articles aimed at &#8220;the woman cooking&#8221; or &#8220;manly gifts&#8221;, or &#8220;pink for girls, blue for boys&#8221;, but I do think it&#8217;s starting to get a  <em>tiny</em> bit better. Our society is so media saturated, that I don&#8217;t even really see or acknowledge most of them nowadays.</p>
<p>Thankfully, my family don&#8217;t fight and my parents were always really careful to share the tasks like shopping and cooking (they are both feminists themselves), so I think I don&#8217;t see a lot of the feminist issues around the holidays,  because I have very little experience of them. Our friends don&#8217;t stress us out or insinuate that there is a certain way one should be acting, so I have always found Christmas to be quite enjoyable.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>A few snapshots of different sorts of feminists, their families  and the festive season. I’m fortunate to have lots of lovely people in  my circle, many of whom identify as feminists and I was interested in  what their Christmases looked like. </em></p>
<p><em>So, are you sitting comfortably? Then let’s continue&#8230;</em></p>
<p><strong>TELL ME A BIT ABOUT YOURSELF.</strong></p>
<p>My name is Oli.  I&#8217;m a man, and I&#8217;m self-identified as a thinker, a pluralist and a liberal socialist rather than a feminist per se. I am all about equality for  everyone &#8211; my feminism, such as it is, is an acknowledgement of a need to redress an imbalance of power and privilege across gender lines and a desire to be aware of the privilege I have by accident of birth and not be insensible to it or frankly abuse it.</p>
<p>I do think that a lot of how I  feel about gender and society has sprung from my exposure to feminist ideas and discourse through my family, social and academic life, not to  mention an ongoing interest in engaging with the society I live in. I suppose I would characterise where I come from on the spectrum as really a post-feminist or a &#8220;sex-positive&#8221; feminist. I&#8217;m about to get married and shortly thereafter I&#8217;m going to be a father. I am happier now, in my mid-thirties and planning a life with someone, than I have ever been.  This is in no small part due to that person being as equally broad-minded, open and thinking a woman as I try to be a  man.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS AT CHRISTMAS?</strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;re planning a quiet, family orientated Christmas with my fiancee&#8217;s family in rural Sussex &#8211; I am looking forward to it immensely!  There  will be food, drink, boardgames, Christmas telly, and most importantly from my perspective, a sense of togetherness.  We will (briefly) celebrate again with my family on the eve of our upcoming wedding when they get back into the country from spending Christmas with my brother and sister-in-law in Belgium.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT HAVE YOU BOUGHT?</strong></p>
<p>A Kindle for my parents, a laptop for my partner, an array of games/DVDs/CDs/books/hats and gloves for various siblings &#8211; that kind of thing.</p>
<p><strong>HOW DO YOU BUY GIFTS?</strong></p>
<p>About half and half online and in the shops &#8211; we have done most of it together.</p>
<p><strong>AS A FEMINIST DO YOU FEEL ANY PARTICULAR PRESSURES OR RESPONSIBILITY AT THIS TIME OF YEAR?</strong></p>
<p>I suppose more than anything I would want to avoid cliche with regard to roles in the &#8220;Family Christmas&#8221; &#8211; there is no reason for just the women to cook and the men to socialise &#8211; but to be frank my lifelong experience of Christmas has been my father cooking Christmas dinner, in fact dealing with all things distaff over the festive period, so to avoid cliche I would have to inhabit my own  personal one.</p>
<p>This year in particular I will be a guest in another family&#8217;s idea of Christmas, and while I want to be true to how I feel about all kinds of things, like not just defaulting to giving little girls &#8220;something pink&#8221; to fighting over the washing up instead of just doing it, I am aware of the fact that I need to bend in the wind of another family&#8217;s prevailing wind, if you&#8217;ll pardon the dreadful imagery.</p>
<p>Tradition has a funny way of entrenching the most trivial gender bias to the most insidious prejudice; I suppose the particular pressure I feel whenever Tradition weighs in, as it does heavily at Christmas, is to not let it force me or allow anyone else to behave in a way that is inappropriate.</p>
<p><strong>AND FINALLY&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>There are many groups of  people that get a pause for thought, at least, from me at Christmas; the old, the lonely, the homeless, and in amongst that I would have to say women who have to be all things to all people over this period, all the way through to the women spending what should be a happy time filled with love and family, running and hiding from abuse.  But as with any other &#8220;time of year&#8221; or similar, I  always find myself chiding myself for not thinking of such things just  on any old Tuesday a bit more often.  I suppose what I want to say is that Christmas being a time for reflection as well as joy is a bit of a double-edged sword; after all, a social conscience of any stripe should be for life, right?</p>

<p><em>So, are you sitting comfortably? Then let’s continue&#8230;</em></p>
<p><strong>TELL ME A BIT ABOUT YOURSELF.</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m <a href="http://kate.craig-wood.com">Kate Craig-Wood</a> and I&#8217;m a technology entrepreneur. I&#8217;m the managing director of Memset, a family business founded and owned by my brother and I. As one of the tiny number of highly successful businesswomen in IT I try to be a bit of a role model and am a big advocate for getting more girls into science and technology where they are much needed!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m very aware that my approach to Christmas, and to my domestic arrangements for that matter, are opposite to the perceived (and, in my experience, common) societal norm of the woman doing the bulk of the present shopping. I attribute this in no small part to my upbringing. I am transgendered, and was raised as a boy, though I have always had a female brain. That is the nature of transsexuality: during gestation the brain differentiates one way and the body another.</p>

<p>In stark contrast to my sister I was brought up to be confident, assertive, comfortable with being the breadwinner and with delegating responsibilities. This is not to say I have always been in such a relationship dynamic; I&#8217;ve often been the &#8220;present buyer&#8221; in the past, but it does mean I do not feel restricted to that stereotypical role in the way that my little sister appears to. My partner, a student at present and himself unfettered by gender stereotypes, is happy to fulfill that role and I am very busy with work, so it makes sense. I firmly believe that if my sister had been afforded the same sort of upbringing as me she would not feel trapped into the often-stressful role of Christmas coordinator, but instead she struggles to ask her husband for help.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS AT CHRISTMAS?</strong></p>
<p>Spending it with my family. Sadly I can&#8217;t have children of my own, but my brother and sister have six between them. Christmas is a time for me to spoil my nieces and nephews and usually ends up with me being knee deep in chocolate wrappers and lego!</p>
<p><strong>WHAT HAVE YOU BOUGHT?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m fortunate to have a very organised boyfriend, with whom the stereotypical roles are very reversed &#8211; I&#8217;m the breadwinner and he takes care of the household and &#8220;detail&#8221;. This means that (with a little input from me) he takes care of the bulk of the Christmas     shopping, and I just have to get things for him, my brother and my sister.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m showering him with gadgets this year: an Xbox Kinect, a big screen for his office (mainly for gaming), and some fancy     headphones. For my brother, a deep intellectual, I&#8217;m getting a pile of books, the main being Stephen Wolfram&#8217;s <em>A New Kind of Science</em>.</p>
<p>The younger kids are fairly easy, especially the boys &#8211; lots of Star Wars Lego! Shopping for my older niece (14) and nephew (13) is  getting harder, but anything from Superdry still seems to be in young-teen-vogue!</p>
<p>My sister is always the difficulty. A dedicated mum and thus something of a polar opposite to me as the career woman (we often     joke how between us we have all the bases covered), there are only so many bits of jewelery, smellies and scarves one can buy her! She has been having a hard time lately, and we don&#8217;t spend enough time together, so this year I&#8217;ve decided to give her a shopping trip (so I can check she likes the things I get her first) and a spa day, also with me, plus various small bits.</p>
<p><strong>HOW DO YOU BUY GIFTS?</strong></p>
<p>I get the big items online, and leave the rest until the very last minute. Everyone thinks I&#8217;m mad to go Christmas shopping on     Christmas Eve, but I find it works rather well for those stocking filler items. My local town centre is pretty quiet &#8211; the shops have     plenty of stock since they are ready for the post-Christmas sales, and the time pressure really focuses the mind! Rather than visiting one shop, seeing something suitable, but then prevaricating, it forces one to be decisive then and there.</p>
<p><strong>DO YOU FEEL ANY PARTICULAR PRESSURES OR RESPONSIBILITY AT THIS TIME OF YEAR?</strong></p>
<p>Christmas&#8217;s approach tends to be generally stressful. We don&#8217;t tend to host over the period, going to those with children rather than them having to move the family to us, so it is not that, but more just a coincidence of deadlines. On the one hand there are presents to buy, which even with assistance I struggle to find time to do in advance, but it is more work and the business of transitioning a company from one financial year to the next with lots of people taking time off in between!</p>
<p>I know I will enjoy the festive period when I&#8217;m in it, but as with most holidays, the prospect of stepping away from my desk for a week or two causes undue worry. Since we provide 24/7 services I feel a responsibility to ensure that everything is in order ahead of this break in particular so that my customers and staff don&#8217;t end up having any unwanted interruptions to their holidays.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>A few snapshots of different sorts of feminists, their families  and the festive season. I’m fortunate to have lots of lovely people in  my circle, many of whom identify as feminists and I was interested in  what their Christmases looked like. </em></p>
<p><em>So, are you sitting comfortably? Then let’s continue&#8230;</em></p>
<p><strong>TELL ME A BIT ABOUT YOURSELF.</strong></p>
<p>I’m John, 41 years old, white, middle class, single, hetero, male. I&#8217;m not sure if I’d call myself a feminist (due to a number of dissenting views as to whether men can be feminists or not) but I have seen the fnords, am aware of the knapsack I carry and try not to wave my privilege in people’s faces too much.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS FOR CHRISTMAS?</strong></p>
<p>Normally  it would be visiting family – either parents or one of my two sisters and their families. But this year I have to work Christmas Eve and the thought of public transport and a suitcase on Dec. 24<sup>th</sup> fills me with a deep horror. So I’m going to visit friends in London for Christmas lunch. This has meant that all presents to family had to be dispatched early, so I’m in the enviable position of having bought all my gifts with a week to go.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT HAVE YOU BOUGHT?</strong></p>
<p>I  have one nephew and four nieces, plus presents for sisters, parents and close friends. Books tend to figure highly on my present buying (and receiving) and Amazon makes everything easy – especially with wishlists.  I’ve tried to stay away from stereotyped presents, but it’s difficult  when a 6-year-old boy really wants a Nerf gun and his 5-year-old sister wants a mouse ballerina doll. With my elder nieces who are in their teens, it’s a bit easier – I can have a conversation with them more easily about what I’m happy buying for them. And luckily, neither of them particularly feel the need to ask for stereotypical presents – this year they’ve received iTunes vouchers (because they want to buy games for their iPod Touches) and a watch/clock that’s hopefully ‘cool’.</p>
<p><strong>HOW DO YOU BUY GIFTS?</strong></p>
<p>This  year it’s been a combination of Amazon and other internet retailers, alongside the Brick Lane and Covent Garden markets. I like getting people presents that either I know they want (hence the joy of wishlists) or that I see and think “that would be perfect for …”. Almost everything has needed to be posted, which has meant small, durable presents.</p>
<p><strong>DO YOU FEEL ANY PARTICULAR PRESSURE OR RESPONSIBILITY AT THIS TIME OF YEAR?</strong></p>
<p>I’m feeling quite guilty about not seeing my parents, despite their reassurances that they understand and that they’re okay with me not travelling up. It’s something that highlights how different my life is from my dad’s – when he was 41 he had a wife, three kids, and was living in a different country to his parents (one of whom had already died).   He didn’t have to travel ‘home’ for Christmas – he <em>was</em> home.</p>
<p><strong>AND FINALLY&#8230;<br />
</strong></p>
<p>I’m  aware that I’m becoming the black sheep of the family. Both my sisters are married with kids; I’m single, run a cabaret occasionally, and still go clubbing regularly. But that gives me a degree of freedom to challenge the way that my nieces and nephew think, in ways their parents might not want to or be able to. I’ve had conversations with the elder nieces about gender specific clothing, kicked off by me mentioning that I’ve worn a skirt and makeup when I’ve been out clubbing, for example.</p>
<p>If I’m going to be the slightly weird uncle, better to use my powers for good, no?</p>

<p><em>So, are you sitting comfortably? Then let’s continue&#8230;</em></p>
<p><strong>TELL ME A BIT ABOUT YOURSELF.</strong></p>
<p>My name is Stef O&#8217;Driscoll. I&#8217;m a young award-winning theatre director &#8211; I received Best Production at the Fringe Report Awards for my debut play <em>Yard Gal</em> in 2009. I&#8217;m artistic director of three companies: Sketchbook Productions, <a href="http://www.innercitytheatre.com/">Inner City Theatre</a> and <a href="http://pt-br.facebook.com/pages/Dirty-Stop-Out-Productions/130993053599838">Dirty Stop Out Productions</a>. In my spare time I produce theatre and film. My goal is to make theatre accessible and enjoyable to everyone.<BR></BR><br />
<strong>WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS AT CHRISTMAS?</strong></p>
<p>I spend Christmas Eve with my dad, stepmum plus brothers and sisters on my dad&#8217;s side of the family. We go for a curry at my dad&#8217;s local Indian. I then spend Christmas Day at my dad&#8217;s house and then I have a second Christmas with my mum on Boxing Day. I&#8217;m lucky to have two Christmases!</p>
<p><strong>WHAT HAVE YOU BOUGHT?</strong></p>
<p>Not a lot as I have not had the time to do so yet &#8211; and I thought I would be clever and get presents online and then due to weather conditions Amazon still have not delivered what apparently has been dispatched two weeks ago!<BR></BR><br />
<strong>HOW DO YOU BUY GIFTS?</strong></p>
<p>Generally I ask what people want and try to get it if I really don’t have a clue what to buy them.  I do enjoy getting presents that really suit the person I am buying for. I like to see people get excited or happy when they open presents.  I avoid Oxford Street and will most probably leave it until Christmas Eve to get the majority of my presents!</p>
<p>There is a pressure to have money, to get good enough presents and to make up for the lack of time I spend with my family throughout the year.</p>
<p><strong>AND FINALLY&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>I wrap my Christmas presents in newspaper.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>A few snapshots of different sorts of feminists, their families and the festive season. I&#8217;m fortunate to have lots of lovely people in my circle, many of whom identify as feminists, and I was interested in what their Christmases looked like. </em></p>
<p><em>So, are you sitting comfortably? Then let&#8217;s begin.<br />
</em></p>
<p><strong>TELL ME A BIT ABOUT YOURSELF.</strong></p>
<p>My name is Phopey and I am a 37-year-old black lesbian CP&#8217;d (Civil Partnership) mother. I have a keen interest in politics: I wanted to be an MP but am re-evaluating that, I think I can be more of an agitator on local level! My pet subject at the moment is healthcare but it used to be education. I participate in healthcare consultancy in three boroughs &#8211; any I can get into, I go. I’m learning. I want to understand the policies on a local level, rather than having a whip telling me what to do.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS AT CHRISTMAS?</strong></p>
<p>I’ve got church on Christmas Eve, I work with a youth group at my church. We’re doing a modern nativity where carols will be rapped *laughter*. After service we will drive to my partner’s family and we spend Christmas with them.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT HAVE YOU BOUGHT?</strong></p>
<p>It’s a tough time. Everything you see is sickly and exaggerated. And so expensive! The essence of what Christmas is about, love and giving, is lost. I made my daughter make Christmas cards this year for friends and family.</p>
<p>When I thought about books, she had to have books – I don’t understand those children who just have toys. My daughter has her own books on a shelf in the lounge, at her eye level. So if I want a book for her, I have to bend down. It’s about language and communicating at her level, not mine. Right now, the important things are about her adjusting to what her world is like, but to be a successful person.</p>
<p>I’ve got a book about two gay swans who fall in love, I’ve got another that’s about a girl who is mixed race and brought up by her grandmother so she can understand different family make-ups. I have got one princess book but it’s about a pig that’s doing ballet<em>.</em> My absolute favourite is about God, but God is a woman it&#8217;s called <em>Big Mamas love.</em></p>
<p><strong>HOW DO YOU BUY TOYS?</strong></p>
<p>I start from an educational basis. When I needed her to understand colour, I bought a psychedelic toy. I like toys to be natural and sustainable, I hate plastic toys. If possible someone has given them to us, I like them to have that spirit of love. That’s important to me. Every toy I get is about stretching her skills: it’s not about something that she can do already.</p>
<p>I have got her a dolls house, but I haven’t got traditional figures in it. My partner&#8217;s father made it and we chose the colours for the rooms together. She has a Sindy doll that lives in there, called Princess. Her Russian princess doll lives in there as well. The figures that live in there are non-traditional. She doesn’t own mum and dad dolls.</p>
<p>I don’t do Lego – I don’t understand why children build something to destroy it – if someone has any thoughts on that let me know! *laughs* I don’t do baby dolls and prams. That is the oldest game in the world – the oldest toy in the world is a baby doll. The first game a child plays is to roleplay their mother. Says a lot about our responsibility, if the mother gets it wrong, that’s diabolical.</p>
<p><strong>DO YOU FEEL A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITY?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, my daughter is my partner&#8217;s egg. My partner is blonde with blue eyes. The donor is American Indian and Black American mix, born from me – a Black African woman. Whoa, have I got responsibility! *laughs* I chose that. Because I’m <em>me</em>, because I had the choice, and the dilemma was I wanted my wife’s child. I’d have to get donor sperm anyway. I watched a programme about surrogates and thought we could do that without giving the child back. We went to Harley Street and a very expensive time later she was born. I’ve got to make sure that everything around her is ordinary but unique.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT PRESSURES HAVE YOU FELT?</strong></p>
<p>I felt the pressure to normalise. I gave in to society&#8217;s pressure that she’s meant to eat all these sweet disgusting things. For the first two years she only ate things I made. I’ve also had people pressure me to <em>not</em> tell her how she was made: that she was such a mix. Because of British law, my partner had to formally adopt her, I have the rights over her, because I gave birth. Which is obviously an emotional trauma for my wife. Any legal moment I have to hand over my rights as a mother. But that’s changing, trust me!</p>
<p><strong>WHAT IS YOUR OPINION ON TOYS FOR GIRLS?</strong></p>
<p>Everything is pretty and plastic! In our society we’re all about facade, so toys are about that. Even baby dolls have designer Gap prams! None of the toys really build on that. It’s why I’m bringing her up Christian, I want her to have a sense of spirit and thinking about herself and consequences. The impact her actions have on people. I don’t think there’s any other way I can do that.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a range of tastes in force at BR Towers, so in a way, conversely, this post stands as proof that categorising anyone by labels when it comes to predicting what they&#8217;ll like &#8211; even <em>&#8216;feminist&#8217;</em> &#8211; is often a fool&#8217;s game. But what the hell. S&#8217;better than yer average &#8220;For Him! For Her!&#8221; Superdrug sleighbell slew, eh?</p>

Check out the eldritch alterna-goth world of <a href="http://www.blackphoenixalchemylab.com/"><strong>Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab</strong></a>. Refreshingly <em>not </em> taking an exclusively &#8220;for her&#8221; angle, their unisex scents are oil-based, concentrated and long-lasting, doubling as room-oils.  You&#8217;ll not find descriptors like &#8220;polished metallic notes, glossy leather, and frankincense&#8221; down your local Boots! (Downsides? The site&#8217;s an arse to navigate &#8211; but persevere, it&#8217;s worth it &#8211; and you&#8217;ll need to email them and state you&#8217;re ordering from outside the US.)</p>
<h3>HODGE says&#8230;</h3>
<p>Where <em>did</em> she get that Greek Alphabet tea towel? Alas, the Cure-listening queen of the <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/category/alphabet/">Alphabet of Femin<em>in</em>ism</a> is keeping that one secret, but says of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Women-Who-Read-Are-Dangerous/dp/1858944651/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1291051698&amp;sr=1-1"><strong>Women Who Read Are Dangerous</strong></a>, edited by Stefan Bollen, &#8220;This is a lovely book; got it for Christmas last year myself.&#8221; It&#8217;s a coffee-table compendium of art depicting women reading, accompanied by (says Amazon) &#8220;<em>politely fiery text which serves to remind one that, in the not too dim  and distant past, for a woman to be seen absorbed in a book was  considered at best a selfish act and at worst a subversive one</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>What else? &#8220;For the parent, I&#8217;d say <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Ballet-Shoes-Noel-Streatfeild/dp/1842556797/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1291034754&amp;sr=1-2">Noel Streatfeild&#8217;s Ballet Shoes</a></strong> (in its non-pink and sparkly format) is a wonderfully feminist work for kids &#8211; the men in it mostly just leave the women to become highly successful on their own, through education and hard work (don&#8217;t forget the shurely-lesbian Dr Jakes and Dr Smith). The fact that Petrova shuns the girly stuff and becomes a pilot is particularly pleasing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sarah will happily accept the shoes, as long as they&#8217;re a shiny, stompy set of <strong><a href="http://store.drmartens.co.uk/">Doc Martens</a></strong>. Pants? Well, if you must, what about <a href="http://www.whomadeyourpants.co.uk/index.php"><strong>Who Made Your Pants</strong></a>, a women&#8217;s collective who make sexy underwear ethically from offcuts? Or if there&#8217;s gotta be a romance novel, let&#8217;s make it an interesting one, like <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Glass-Books-Dream-Eaters/dp/0670916471"><strong>The Glass Books of the Dream Eaters</strong></a>.</p>
<h3>SARAH J says&#8230;</h3>
<p>&#8220;<strong>Anne Taintor</strong> magnets! Examples <a href="http://annetaintor.com/allproducts.html?sub=Magnets&amp;id=01021">here</a>, <a href="http://annetaintor.com/allproducts.html?sub=Magnets&amp;id=01310">here</a>, and [fave: <em>make your own damn dinner</em>] <a href="http://annetaintor.com/allproducts.html?sub=Magnets&amp;id=01081">here</a>. Or there&#8217;s this &#8216;<a href="http://www.buyolympia.com/q/Item=readingisblue"><strong>&#8216;Reading is Sexy&#8217; T-shirt</strong> </a>&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Anything else? &#8220;<strong>Sticker Sisters</strong> do lots of cool things.&#8221; Agreed &#8211; try these <strong><a href="http://www.stickersisters.com/item/Action-Not-Glamor-Shoelaces-2">&#8216;Action Not Glamor&#8217; shoelaces</a></strong> for size. Or <a href="http://www.stickersisters.com/item/Blue-Action-Not-Glamour-T-Shirt-62">the corresponding tee!</a> (US spelling; universal sentiment.) Or this <a href="http://www.stickersisters.com/item/Brave-Girl-Kelly-T-Shirt-89">&#8216;Brave Girl&#8217; tee</a>!</p>
<p>Finally, Sarah reckons you could do worse than pop one of the <strong>Alanna</strong> books by <strong>Tamora Pierce</strong> in someone&#8217;s Christmas stocking &#8211; &#8220;They&#8217;re for children/teens, but I don&#8217;t think they hold up too badly for adults who want a right-on but undemanding fantasy read. There&#8217;s a magic cat, a lot of sword fighting and a surprisingly healthy and sensible attitude to sex.  <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0689878559/ref=s9_simh_gw_p14_d0_i1?pf_rd_m=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&amp;pf_rd_s=center-2&amp;pf_rd_r=1GXESE5P9GH6CTQ100T3&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=467128533&amp;pf_rd_i=468294">Here&#8217;s the first one (of four) on Amazon</a>.&#8221;</p>
<h3>STEPHEN B says&#8230;</h3>
<p>&#8220;I want to buy everyone the <strong>Avatar: The Last Airbender </strong> <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Avatar-Legend-Aang-Book-Complete/dp/B001KQ034G/ref=pd_bxgy_d_h__img_c">TV series boxset</a>. (And I mean everyone: boys, girls, geeks, non-geeks, everyone else, it&#8217;s good for all.) <strong>Not</strong> the movie, no.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anything else? &#8220;Membership to the <strong><a href="http://ukwct.org.uk/index.php?page=wolves">UK Wolf Conservation Trust</a></strong>. You can go for walks in the forest with wolves. Yes, really.&#8221;</p>
<h3>MARKGRAF says&#8230;</h3>
<p>&#8220;Picture books!  I love picture books.  Didn&#8217;t you love them as a child?  Who didn&#8217;t!  What&#8217;s going on with us stopping reading them,  then?  It&#8217;s nonsense.  Picture books are the greatest, and there&#8217;s a  whole world of completely fabulous <strong>queer-friendly picture books</strong> out there that I just wish I&#8217;d had as a kid.  But now we&#8217;re adults and we get to spend how we like&#8230; and one of those ways can be picture books.   Because we <em>can</em>.  Here&#8217;s a little selection of my favourites&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Tango-Makes-Three-Justin-Richardson/dp/1847381480/ref=wl_it_dp_o?ie=UTF8&amp;coliid=I1IHE3QFKIHIPK&amp;colid=XHPV6RHH307T"><strong>And Tango Makes Three</strong></a>: &#8220;You&#8217;ll have heard of this one, presumably.  It was banned in some  schools in America.  It&#8217;s a book about penguins who love each other &#8211; also, it&#8217;s based on a true story.  And it was banned because the penguins who love each other are boys!  What an amazing world we live in.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/King-Linda-Haan/dp/1582460612/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1292347950&amp;sr=1-1"><strong><strong>King And King</strong></strong></a>: &#8220;I bought this straight out before I read it because it sounded so  perfect.  It is indeed perfect.  I cried all over it and I&#8217;m not even ashamed to say so.  It&#8217;s one of the reasons I&#8217;m not allowed in childrens&#8217; book sections any more.&#8221;<a href="http://www.sevenstories.com/book/?GCOI=58322100167510"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.sevenstories.com/book/?GCOI=58322100167510"><br />
<strong>10,000 Dresses</strong></a>: &#8220;I want this so badly I don&#8217;t even know what to do with myself.  I can&#8217;t give you a full <em>précis</em> of it because I haven&#8217;t read it yet!  But it came to me highly recommended, and frankly, we need trans visibility that isn&#8217;t risible or offensive. Yeah!&#8221;</p>
<h3>RHIAN says&#8230;</h3>
<p>I task Rhian, fresh from her <a href="/2010/11/30/gaye-advert-and-the-great-cock-n-balls-swindle/">recent post on punk</a>, and now the latest addition to our team (YEAH) with providing a music recommendation. I&#8217;m not disappointed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm. How about the <strong>Indelicates </strong>album, <strong>Songs for Swinging  Lovers</strong>? Based not only on Julia Indelicate being one of the most incisively outspoken radical feminists currently hammering a keyboard,  but also on the band&#8217;s method of DIY distribution which means you can officially pay what you like, including zero, to download their stuff.  The album is available <a href="http://corporaterecords.co.uk/artists/The+Indelicates/Songs+For+Swinging+Lovers">here</a>.&#8221;</p>
<h3>I say&#8230;</h3>
<p>What about a vintage poster? Casual misogyny may be rife in wartime propaganda, but you can&#8217;t beat Rosie the Riveter, co-opted for years as a feminist icon, for a bit of wallspiration. <em>We can do it! </em>Here&#8217;s a page of <strong><a href="http://www.allposters.co.uk/gallery.asp?startat=%2Fgetthumb.asp&amp;CID=83CA43019161476D96B786940AF1F19E&amp;txtSearch=rosie+riveter&amp;imageField2.x=0&amp;imageField2.y=0">posters featuring Rosie-related imagery</a></strong>. Or you could boldly brave the Imperial War Museum shop, bypassing the more patronising end of the poster archive (I&#8217;m looking at you, <em>Keep Mum, she&#8217;s not so dumb</em>), for <strong><a href="http://www.iwmshop.org.uk/product/12798/Come_into_the_Factories_Poster">this mighty number</a></strong>, which is up on the wall at BR Towers.</p>
<p>Readables? I dig <strong>Alison Bechdel</strong>&#8216;s autobiographical <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Fun-Home-Alison-Bechdel/dp/0224080512/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1292790147&amp;sr=1-1"><strong>Fun Home</strong></a> (Jen also attests to this, as I threw it her way in November for her birthday).  Or how about recent Booker-scooper Hilary Mantel&#8217;s haunting novel <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Beyond-Black-Hilary-Mantel/dp/0007157762"><strong>Beyond Black</strong></a>, which features a complex pair of women at its centre, one of whom is psychic? Or the book which reminded us to get off our arses and start this site, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Reclaiming-Word-New-Feminist-Movement/dp/1848133952/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1292790431&amp;sr=1-1"><strong>Reclaiming the F-Word</strong></a>?</p>

<p>Or check out the <strong>Museum of London</strong> shop in person for this <strong>badass suffragette sketchbook &#8216;n&#8217; tote bag</strong>, pictured above. Warning, I&#8217;m not sure if they still have it; I&#8217;ve looked online, but I can&#8217;t find it.  Hopefully they&#8217;ve not run out&#8230;</p>
<p>Whatever you&#8217;re up to, have a good one!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s the Festive Season, so we are putting up tinsel on the collective BadRep Christmas tree and trying not to speculate too deeply on the reason why we lug a lot of greenery into the house during winter time (it&#8217;s not pagan, it&#8217;s traditional. Honest). We are also shopping for gifts. I like presents. I like selecting the right ones for my nearest and dearest so they know that I love them, and that I&#8217;ve spent at least some part of my life thinking about what would be most appropriate to give them. Hopefully they&#8217;ve done the same thing too, and we shall all be happy.  However, the process of actually getting those gifts is fraught with danger and turmoil of the gendered kind. Because at this time of the year, more so than perhaps any other, we see the division along the pink and blue lines where people are encouraged to think of Gifts For Him and Gifts For Her. A quick trawl through the websites of some of the UK&#8217;s most popular Christmas stores shows this wave of sexual stereotyping crashing on the shores of our present-buying choices.</p>
<p>There are desperately predictable pickings over at <a href="http://www.boots.com/en/Christmas/For-Her/">Our Favourite Chemist</a>, &#8220;feminine&#8221; monstrosities at the shop now <a href="http://www.woolworths.co.uk/top-gifts-for-her/e/s/bestsellers,0/promo/31000005.end?cm_re=Christmas+Zonepage-_-Header_LHN_Whats+Hot+This+Week-_-TopGiftsForHer">sadly departed from the high street</a> &#8211; although with this sort of blatant sexism, perhaps good riddance? These include the despressing Christmas staple of &#8220;girl&#8221; versions of items once considered gender neutral but now given the familiar make-over of<em> normal is for men, pink is for women</em>. Even <a href="http://www.iwantoneofthose.com/gifts-for-her/index.html">the world of silly gadgets</a> is not immune to this disease &#8211; pink, fluffy, heart covered, plushie, watered down and washed up doo-dads of every Barbie-filled nightmare haunt the screen.</p>
<div id="attachment_1679" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/pink-ps2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1679" data-attachment-id="1679" data-permalink="/2010/12/14/all-i-want-for-christmas-is/pink-ps2/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/pink-ps2.jpg?fit=300%2C160&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="300,160" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Pink controller for a PS2" data-image-description="&lt;p&gt;Pink controller for a PS2&lt;/p&gt;
" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/pink-ps2.jpg?fit=300%2C160&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/pink-ps2.jpg?fit=300%2C160&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1679 " src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/pink-ps2.jpg?resize=300%2C160" alt="Pink controller for a PS2" width="300" height="160" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1679" class="wp-caption-text">Because otherwise women wouldn&#039;t know they were allowed to play computer games.</p></div>
<p>I&#8217;ve selected the girly items to avoid over-linking, but the ones for men are just as bad, though less eye-gougingly pastel. Department stores  like <a href="http://www.debenhams.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/category_10001_10001_165614_-1">Debenhams </a>and <a href="http://www.selfridges.com/en/Christmas/Categories/Gifts-for-her/">Selfridges</a> dole out the standard patter of perfume, chocolates, underwear,  jewellery, handbags and ungents. (Expensive) stuff to eat and (expensive) stuff to wear. That&#8217;s what women want, clearly.</p>
<p>Now before anyone begins with the &#8220;But I am a woman and I like flowers/scent/bags/this maribou feather hat and gloves combo&#8221;. Yes. That is fine. Good. Carry on. There is <em>nothing wrong</em> with individuals liking things that are traditionally ascribed to their gender. Wearing pink does not make you a Bad Feminist (TM). But there is a whole heap wrong with assuming that someone must like those things <em>because</em> they are a woman. And that is just what is happening on the High Street right now. Millions of people are walking around choosing gifts sold to them under these headlines.</p>
<p>These are tropes so ingrained that it seems almost part of our social furniture. Girls get X and Boys get Y. Even at this time of goodwill to all, we seem unable to shake the idea that gender is biologically constructed and that our chromosomes deliver different desires so that shopping arcade Santas can conveniently wrap it all up in cis-tastic cerise and cyan. I appreciate that it is useful for businesses to be able to categorise gifts into different areas for ease of shopping, but this gendered nonsense has to stop. Not only is it reductive and ridiculous, it also makes the present less special, less unique to that supposedly unique person in your life because it&#8217;s just the same as what half of the population is supposed to want. Fortunately, for all of you frantic shoppers out there who unlike me probably have a family larger than four (yup, it&#8217;s just me, my parents and my brother) there is a solution. You could do what the biggest Christmas retailer has done and just<em> browse by category</em>. That&#8217;s right, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/ref=gno_logo">Amazon</a>, in a stroke of genius, have divided their goods up <em>according to the type of item.</em> Not For Girls or For Boys but, you know, For People. Who like things.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ll be buying from them this year. And I suggest you do too.</p>
