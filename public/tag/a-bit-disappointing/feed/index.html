										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, here&#8217;s a cigarette advert from several decades ago. Y&#8217;know, back before they knew cigarettes killed you and stuff. Also back when gender representations in advertising were even more terrible.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/old-fashioned-ad3.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="5452" data-permalink="/2011/05/17/what-the-hell-advertising/old-fashioned-ad3/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/old-fashioned-ad3.jpg?fit=522%2C673&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="522,673" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Vintage cigarettes advert" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/old-fashioned-ad3.jpg?fit=232%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/old-fashioned-ad3.jpg?fit=522%2C673&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/old-fashioned-ad3.jpg?resize=522%2C673" alt="Vintage advert for Tipalet cigarettes. Shows a man exhaling smoke in a womans face. Tagline: Blow in her face and she'll follow you anywhere." width="522" height="673" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5452" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/old-fashioned-ad3.jpg?w=522&amp;ssl=1 522w, https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/old-fashioned-ad3.jpg?w=232&amp;ssl=1 232w" sizes="(max-width: 522px) 100vw, 522px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>But hey, that was decades ago, right? That was from a time when people held far more dubious views, hell people had only recently stopped using tape worms as a miracle diet (<a href="http://vintagecatalog.net/2009/11/19/helpful-tapeworms/">no, seriously</a>). It was a less enlightened time, but we&#8217;ve moved on since then, yes?</p>
<p>Well, no, not so much. The world of advertising is still filled with dubious messages, awkward depictions of race and gender, and terrible division of products along gender lines (&#8220;This is a girl product! Make the packaging pink so they&#8217;ll buy it! This is a boy product! Fill the advert with explosions!&#8221;) So what we have here is a collection of half a dozen or so recent magazine adverts that have taken their attitudes straight from the 1950s.</p>
<h3>Mr. Clean</h3>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/vo9jV.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="5454" data-permalink="/2011/05/17/what-the-hell-advertising/vo9jv/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/vo9jV.jpg?fit=1353%2C1361&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1353,1361" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Mr. Clean Advert" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/vo9jV.jpg?fit=298%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/vo9jV.jpg?fit=1017%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/vo9jV-298x300.jpg?resize=398%2C400" alt="Magazine advert for Mr. Clean cleaning products, shows a woman and her daughter cleaning, tag line 'This mothers day, get back to the job that really matters'" width="398" height="400" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5454" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/vo9jV.jpg?w=298&amp;ssl=1 298w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/vo9jV.jpg?w=150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/vo9jV.jpg?w=1017&amp;ssl=1 1017w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/vo9jV.jpg?w=1353&amp;ssl=1 1353w" sizes="(max-width: 398px) 100vw, 398px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>It was Mothers&#8217; Day in the US recently, and Mr Clean decided to run this advert for the occasion. Maybe I&#8217;m misinterpreting the advert. Maybe Mothers&#8217; Day in the US is a bit different to the UK. Either way, the apparent message of &#8220;Get back to the cleaning! And get your daughter to help, she needs to learn!&#8221; seems a little&#8230; well, off. </p>
<h3>Goldstar Beer</h3>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/AljVU.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="5457" data-permalink="/2011/05/17/what-the-hell-advertising/aljvu/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/AljVU.jpg?fit=700%2C495&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="700,495" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Beer Advert" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/AljVU.jpg?fit=300%2C212&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/AljVU.jpg?fit=700%2C495&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/AljVU.jpg?resize=600%2C415" alt="Advert for beer, complex diagram showing the choices of drink for a woman - many feminine options - and the choices for a man - one pint of beer." width="600" height="415" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5457" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/AljVU.jpg?zoom=2&amp;resize=600%2C415&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/AljVU.jpg?zoom=3&amp;resize=600%2C415&amp;ssl=1 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Goldstar Beer have an interesting view of how drinking works, one that manages to simultaneously insult both men and women. Women are complex and have to worry about matching their drinks (girly, fruity drinks, naturally) to their outfits, because they&#8217;re shallow like that. Men, meanwhile, are simple-minded creatures who are only capable of desiring one thing: beer. And not even good beer. Crappy mass-market beer. </p>
<p>Goldstar have another advert in this campaign that manages to be even worse on some levels &#8211; take a look for yourself <a href="http://adsoftheworld.com/media/print/goldstar_beer_flow_chart_2?size=_original">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Nike</h3>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/zll1L.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="5460" data-permalink="/2011/05/17/what-the-hell-advertising/zll1l/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/zll1L.jpg?fit=287%2C440&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="287,440" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Nike advert" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/zll1L.jpg?fit=195%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/zll1L.jpg?fit=287%2C440&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/zll1L.jpg?resize=287%2C440" alt="Advert for Nike trainers. Ugly cluttered graphics of sporting things and vague swirls, tag line 'The only thing worse than going to the ballet is going to the ballet to watch your son.'" width="287" height="440" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5460" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/zll1L.jpg?w=287&amp;ssl=1 287w, https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/zll1L.jpg?w=195&amp;ssl=1 195w" sizes="(max-width: 287px) 100vw, 287px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just gender that advertising fails on either. Here we get a delightful intersection of gender and homophobia from the fine folks at Nike. Because ballet isn&#8217;t manly, you see, and you don&#8217;t want your son to do something that isn&#8217;t manly. Best buy him some Nike trainers as soon as you can and get him doing something macho like soccer, before the homosexuals lure him into their sordid world of energetic dance routines and toned calf muscles. Because that is totally how reality works. Yes.</p>
<h3>DeBeers</h3>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/otA4c.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="5461" data-permalink="/2011/05/17/what-the-hell-advertising/ota4c/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/otA4c.jpg?fit=879%2C1200&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="879,1200" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Diamonds Advert" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/otA4c.jpg?fit=219%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/otA4c.jpg?fit=750%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/otA4c-750x1024.jpg?resize=420%2C600" alt="Advert for diamonds. A string of diamonds on a black background and the tag line 'Hey, what do you know, she think you're funny again.'" width="420" height="600" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5461" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/otA4c.jpg?zoom=2&amp;resize=420%2C600&amp;ssl=1 840w, https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/otA4c.jpg?zoom=3&amp;resize=420%2C600&amp;ssl=1 1260w" sizes="(max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Women, you see, are basically like magpies, only larger and incapable of flight. So not very good magpies. But like magpies, women are innately drawn to shiny shiny things; the shinier the better. And as DeBeers know, if you feed her craving for shiny objects then she&#8217;ll pretend to like you and sate your desperate need for validation. Which, of course, is all women are good for. (That and cooking you dinner, which is a talent the common magpie rarely excels at.)</p>
<p>Wait no, all of that was wrong. What the hell, DeBeers? Really?</p>
<h3>Prudential Financial</h3>

<p>Social values, 1950s style. Cooking, cleaning, caring for your child. These all start with C. More importantly, they&#8217;re all things that the wife does, because hey, it&#8217;s not like she has a job, right? Women in the workplace? Madness! And all of those things are time consuming; why, hiring someone to do them all would be fairly expensive. When your wife dies, you won&#8217;t be grieving over the loss of your life&#8217;s love, you&#8217;ll be wondering who&#8217;s going to make dinner if you can&#8217;t afford to hire a cook. So you&#8217;d better get life insurance out on her. Or, I guess, buy some diamonds and lure a magpie, either way.</p>
<h3>Qsol Servers</h3>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Kngz7.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="5459" data-permalink="/2011/05/17/what-the-hell-advertising/kngz7/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Kngz7.jpg?fit=354%2C473&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="354,473" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Qsol Advert" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Kngz7.jpg?fit=224%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Kngz7.jpg?fit=354%2C473&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Kngz7.jpg?resize=354%2C473" alt="Advert for Qsol servers.

<p>I was going to say something bitingly snarky and witty, but&#8230; I just&#8230; wow. I&#8217;ve been defeated by this advert. Just imagine I said something hilarious and cutting and you&#8217;re all very entertained.</p>
<p>So, defeated by that last advert, I&#8217;m going to stop here. I implore all of you to go out and get jobs in advertising and make better adverts than these, so that we can someday feature them in <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/category/category-found-feminism/">Found Feminism</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Q: How many feminists does it take to change a light bulb?
A: THAT'S NOT FUNNY!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Please welcome the glorious <strong>Hannah Eiseman-Renyard</strong> to the guestpost soapbox&#8230; </em></p>
<blockquote><p>Q: How many feminists does it take to change a light bulb?</p>
<p>A: THAT&#8217;S NOT FUNNY!</p></blockquote>
<p>I love live comedy, honest I do. I spent two weeks at the <strong>Edinburgh Fringe Festival</strong> last year and I&#8217;ll be there for the full three weeks this year. Some of my best friends are (very good) comedians. However, as a scene: live comedy has a problem. I haven&#8217;t been an aficionado for many years, so maybe it was always there &#8211; but if <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2010/sep/10/rape-jokes-in-comedy">recent articles</a> are anything to go by; it seems to be growing. Increasingly, the search for &#8216;edgy&#8217; material is translating into a scene where the recoil laugh &#8211; the <em>I-can&#8217;t-believe-you-just-said-that </em>laugh &#8211; is the only one aimed for. The targets are &#8216;soft&#8217; &#8211; minorities and marginalized groups &#8211; and the jokes prod at the same old prejudices. The numbers of times I come home from a comedy gig wanting to dry-clean my brain is rising.</p>

A sketch group of white, able-bodied young men performed a series of female grotesques which were so consistently unpleasant that &#8211; though cheerily presented &#8211; the unmistakable undercurrent to the evening was &#8216;we really don&#8217;t like women much.&#8217; Most sketches involved a member of the group donning a plastic wig to &#8216;be a girl&#8217; &#8211; and every female character was a Lolita, a whore, a woman giving birth or a mother who hated her children. The punchlines ranged from coat hanger abortions to incest to rape to paedophilia. At my table, from about halfway through, we didn&#8217;t laugh so much as look to each other for reaction shots and a reality check. This troupe&#8217;s final skit was a song and dance number, the &#8216;Cell Block Tango&#8217; from <strong>Chicago</strong>, with the <a href="http://www.allmusicals.com/lyrics/chicago/cellblocktango.htm">words</a> changed to &#8216;<em>she</em> had it coming&#8217;. Had there not been other people on the bill who I really wanted to see, I would have walked out then and there.</p>
<p>The problem is more widespread than just <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/theatreblog/2010/aug/18/edinburgh-comedy-porn-gimp-fight">one shit comedy troupe </a>. People more eloquent than myself have pointed out this <a href="http://chris-coltrane.livejournal.com/405924.html">return to the bad old days</a>. It seems like the decades of hard-earned progress, a basic standard of &#8216;don&#8217;t be a shit to the marginalised&#8217;, is being discarded because now it&#8217;s apparently ironic. Sexism is increasingly tolerated (after all, everything&#8217;s sorted and equal now, so just lighten up, bitch) and other kinds of prejudice are also creeping back, too. &#8216;It&#8217;s not racist, it&#8217;s just un-PC, and no one likes political correctness. So, while we&#8217;re at it, what about those immigrants, homos, and the disabled, aye?&#8217;</p>
<p>Increasingly comedians who get pulled up for saying genuinely unpleasant things (I&#8217;m looking at you, <a href="http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2010/12/09/12343/jordans_fury_over_frankie_boyle_gag_"><strong>Frankie Boyle</strong></a>) have taken this to be their selling point and then upped the ante in general douchery. While Jordan, the gossip-magazines&#8217; favourite glamour model, might seem a fair target, when exactly did her disabled son become fair game, too? Let alone in a joke about incest and rape. I&#8217;ll repeat that: an incest-rape joke about a disabled eight-year-old child. </p>
<p>While I&#8217;m sure there has always been some truly unpleasant comedy around, its apparent mainstream acceptance is a new trend. The Frankie Boyle joke aired on Channel 4. This worries me because our words do carry a power &#8211; they reflect how we see the world, but they also set our standards for what is normal, acceptable, okay. The trickle-down effect has real-world consequences. The <a href="http://fugitivus.wordpress.com/2009/06/24/a-woman-walks-into-a-rape-uh-bar/">rise of the rape joke</a> can be a horrific trigger for those who have experienced it. In increments, these themes &#8211; packaged as entertainment &#8211; normalise these horrors and dismiss their seriousness.  </p>
<p>This is not an argument for censorship &#8211; I had fervent arguments a few years ago with Daily Fail-reading colleagues about whether <strong>Jerry Springer: The Opera</strong> should be shown on TV (yes, yes, a thousand times yes!) &#8211; but there is a huge middle ground between Mary Whitehouse prudery and comedy which is getting pretty close to hatespeech. Please, guys: self-regulate a little by engaging the brain.</p>
<p>Some would argue that if I don&#8217;t like this brand of comedy, I just shouldn&#8217;t watch it. To some extent they&#8217;re right, and I do try. When I saw a poster in Edinburgh for a standup show called &#8216;The Lying Bitch and the Wardrobe&#8217; (I see what you did there) I had a pretty strong inkling that this wouldn&#8217;t be my kind of thing and I didn&#8217;t go. But on a mixed bill (as almost all small live comedy gigs are) there&#8217;s rarely any warning what each person will do &#8211; so while you might have gone along because you recognise one name that you like, there is no disclosure until you&#8217;re hearing it that the third act, Joe Bloggs, will be your prejudiced asshat for the evening, berating you all with a microphone for at least ten minutes.</p>
<p>Oh, and you paid to see this.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think anything should be off-limits &#8211; but some topics are so unpleasant (not to mention increasingly over-mined) that if a comedian wants to tackle them they will need to be so damn funny, so ingenious, original, tactful &#8211; that 80% of comedians just shouldn&#8217;t bother. Needless to say, the 80% that aren&#8217;t up to speed don&#8217;t get this, and the 20% that can do it well often have better things to do than prod triggertastic subjects and tired old clichés with a great big stick. They&#8217;re off crafting material that makes you belly-laugh (and think) rather than just titter nervously in disbelief.</p>

<p>I think the thing which is missing (besides originality) is a measure of basic empathy. In the increasingly desperate search for &#8216;dark&#8217; and &#8216;cutting edge&#8217; material, comedians forget that a lot of their lazily-picked targets are people. Real people. People with feelings and also (self-interest alert, guys:) <em>people who go to comedy gigs.</em></p>
<p>The rising amount of &#8216;ironic&#8217; misogyny is not creating a particularly friendly environment for a certain 50% of punters. Last year I went to the <strong>Comedy Store</strong> to see twelve different comedians being filmed for <a href="http://www.theworldstandsup.com"><strong>The World Stands Up</strong></a>. I wasn&#8217;t entirely sure if the person who&#8217;d invited me along had intended the evening as a date or not, so it was potentially awkward already. Then, as the evening unfolded, four out of twelve comedians used &#8216;bad fellatio&#8217; as the bedrock of their sets. One standup spent his whole set mocking his wife for not pleasuring him correctly. In the narratives that we heard that night, women&#8217;s main role was as dispensers of sexual favours &#8211; and we couldn&#8217;t even do that right. Thanks, guys. I haven&#8217;t been back to the Comedy Store since.</p>
<p>For another example, I was once out with a group for a friend&#8217;s birthday when a standup did a set about making a mess in the disabled toilet and blaming it on a disabled person. While he wasn&#8217;t to know that birthday girl, sat in the front row, had cerebral palsy, why did he think this would be a good topic in the first place? How many times has he encouraged the able-bodied to laugh at this disadvantaged minority&#8217;s expense?</p>

Catherine Semark performing at Edinburgh Fringe. Photo by me. </p></div>One piece of etiquette that people seem to be riding roughshod over is whether you have a &#8216;claim&#8217; to your material. While there aren&#8217;t any rules about who is allowed to talk about what, whether or not you&#8217;re on the receiving end of a prejudice can make a huge difference to whether or not you have the empathy, warmth, and originality to do it well.  <strong>Richard Pryor</strong>, <strong>Omid Djalili</strong>, <strong>Sarah Silverman</strong>, or <strong>Goodness Gracious Me</strong> on race: usually very good. <strong>Jim Davidson</strong> on race: enough said.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t an argument for &#8216;nice&#8217; comedy. Some of my favourite comedians are pretty darn dark and twisted &#8211; <strong>Bill Hicks</strong>, <strong>Dylan Moran</strong>, and I heartily recommend London sketch group <a href="http://www.thebetamales.com"><strong>The Beta Males</strong></a>  &#8211; but the &#8216;type&#8217; of twisted is crucial.  Jokes are about status &#8211; people use them every day to agree boundaries of what&#8217;s acceptable, and with that comes a certain amount of responsibility. When activist comedians such as <strong>Mark Thomas</strong> or <strong>Kate Smurthwaite</strong> use humour to mock people in power for making bad decisions, that&#8217;s something very different to a middle class standup laying into &#8216;chavs&#8217; for &#8216;talking funny and drinking cheap booze&#8217;.</p>
<p>Anger and humour are very often interlinked, but <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2011/feb/05/top-gear-offensive-steve-coogan ">where you aim that anger makes all the difference</a>. Aim it &#8216;up&#8217; at deserving, more powerful targets and it&#8217;s subversive, it can hold people to account &#8211; satire has a long and proud tradition. Aim that anger &#8216;down&#8217; at the underdog and it&#8217;s tired, old and &#8211; frankly &#8211; it&#8217;s bullying.  </p>

<p>Much has been said about his words, but a lot of the online discussion focuses on &#8220;I now think he&#8217;s a douche&#8221; and not on why the post should be regarded as offensive. Well, I&#8217;m pretty clear on why I find it offensive.</p>
<p>In my posts for BadRep I have often expressed the sentiment that <A href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/12/16/big-dog/" />men have unique problems in society</a>, and that those problems are just as invisible as some feminist issues. I believe it&#8217;s true. I&#8217;ve also recently written a post which stated my feelings on the constant cry of &#8220;<A href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/03/24/but-what-about-teh-menz/" />but what about the men?</a>&#8221; in response to feminist discussion. Short answer: if you look at the world and don&#8217;t see massive gender inequality harming women a lot more than men, and don&#8217;t think that reducing the gap (and aiming to eliminate these issues for everyone) would be a good thing, then I don&#8217;t want to know you.</p>
<p>Scott Adams didn&#8217;t say that feminism was no longer needed, or that men have bigger problems than women. His post can be summed up in two parts:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Now I would like to speak directly to my male readers who feel unjustly treated by the widespread suppression of men’s rights:</p>
<p>Get over it, you bunch of pussies.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Why would he say that &#8211; because he sees women&#8217;s rights as far more under attack? Er&#8230; no. He has this advice instead:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The reality is that women are treated differently by society for exactly the same reason that children and the mentally handicapped are treated differently. It’s just easier this way for everyone. You don’t argue with a four-year old about why he shouldn’t eat candy for dinner. You don’t punch a mentally handicapped guy even if he punches you first. And you don’t argue when a women tells you she’s only making 80 cents to your dollar. It’s the path of least resistance. You save your energy for more important battles.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Scott states that he&#8217;s <em>not</em> comparing &#8216;women&#8217; directly to &#8216;people with disabilities&#8217; or children, but does advise his (male) audience to treat them all the same way &#8211; to take into account the &#8220;emotional realities of other people&#8221;.</p>
<p>And this is where most online discussion is only just starting to get it. It doesn&#8217;t MATTER if he&#8217;s right, or if he&#8217;s a realist. Either way this is shitty, inhumane advice.</p>
<p>It puts the reader in the group taking action, and puts women (and other humans with inconvenient &#8217;emotional realities&#8217;) in a group marked &#8220;Other&#8221;. And as we all know, that&#8217;s classic 101 to dehumanising your target and making it easier to see them as objects who don&#8217;t need to be considered. It&#8217;s also bollocks. He&#8217;s giving instructions for how to manipulate others for your own success, without looking at any possibility of finding any common ground, sharing boundaries, or viewing them as real people who could be talked to. They&#8217;re just there to be made to go away with the least stress to him. Adams is dismissing the idea that his current views could be <em>wrong</em> and that he might learn something from women, because dialogue is not an option. He&#8217;d rather choose the path of least resistance. That&#8217;s a pretty closed mind right there.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not easier for &#8220;everyone&#8221;, Scott. Just you. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s not easier for women, for example. Also: women, children and &#8220;the mentally handicapped&#8221;(!) are together a <em>majority</em>, which makes you sitting inside your privileged minority and dismissing them like this all the more craptastic. The majority of the human race are more emotional than you, Scott, and as you&#8217;ve just demonstrated probably have more empathy too.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the post he says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Fairness is an illusion. It’s unobtainable in the real world.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>For someone who has spent decades writing about the inhumanity of big business, that&#8217;s a surprising quote. And my inner Hopeless Idealist rejects it totally. Yes, men face different inequalities: in the divorce courts, in countries with a military draft, in society&#8217;s ancient ideas of what &#8216;masculine&#8217; behaviour is. But even if I felt that these somehow matched the towering mountain of (frequently lethal) inequality facing women (which I don&#8217;t by several miles), I would never give up on seeking fairness. It&#8217;s an instinctive, empathic, humane response which shows that you&#8217;re a decent human being.</p>
<p>So yeah, I now think Scott Adams is a douche as well. Several additional words spring to mind (the lovely <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/about/">Miranda</a> put in a vote for &#8220;ableist asshat&#8221; at this juncture). If you want to read his justifications (that he often takes the point of view on his blog which is most difficult to defend, that his readers know he often doesn&#8217;t even believe the argument he&#8217;s making, that we&#8217;re all devoid of &#8220;reading comprehension&#8221;) then you can wander over to where he&#8217;s currently <A href="http://www.feministe.us/blog/archives/2011/03/24/scott-adams-to-mens-rights-activists-dont-bother-arguing-with-women-theyre-like-children">trolling the comment thread at Feministe.</a> Yes, seriously. At no time does he back down from the opinion he stated, or acknowledge how the act of grouping 51% of the planet and more into an &#8216;overly emotional&#8217; box to be safely ignored for his own mental peace of mind is in any way douche-worthy.</p>
<p>We are better than his exclusionary, patronising bullshit, people. There&#8217;s an alternative where we keep talking, and learning, and looking for ways to make a society we can be proud of. Together. Because women are human beings, and the fact that this still needs saying means that <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/10/12/the-bottom-rung-of-the-ladder">all men should be jumping aboard the feminism boat</a> for joint rock n&#8217; roll pirate adventures. The alternative is a land run by people as ignorant, reactionary and self-absorbed as the boss in the Dilbert comics, and no-one wins when that happens.</p>
