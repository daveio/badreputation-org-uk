					<description><![CDATA[VH1 asked Siouxsie not to perform it because it contains references to menstrual blood.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We recently, as a team, <a href="http://www.thisismyjam.com/badrepuk">signed &#8220;BadrepUK&#8221; up to <strong>This Is My Jam</strong></a>. This got me thinking about the songs I might submit to the Grand Communal <del datetime="2012-09-14T21:41:17+00:00">Cacophony</del> Mixtape. Given our name, we kicked off with Joan Jett (of course), but I think the next thing I&#8217;m going to send our Rhian (who is curating the Jams at the moment) is actually this.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a Creatures single from &#8217;99. It&#8217;s an acquired taste. But I like it, for a few reasons.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/UXtKf9nByhc" frameborder="0" width="480" height="360"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Exterminating Angel</strong> was released on a late Creatures album, <strong>Anima Animus</strong>, in 1999, and was still a dancefloor mainstay in the early-to-mid-&#8217;00s in the kind of sticky-floored goth clubs I liked to frequent in my late teens and early 20s.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a weird track in the context of the rest of the album, nearly all of which is gentler, and none of which has the same relentless, malicious, jagged electro edge. It&#8217;s the track you remember the most, with its Biblical, apocalyptic theme and pounding percussion. The rest of the album&#8217;s tracks kind of have to be coaxed out from a musical cupboard-under-the-stairs where they&#8217;ve hidden from its sweeping bite. After picking up the CD &#8211; the day after it and I collided on one of the aforementioned sticky goth dancefloors &#8211; I spent some months hitting the repeat button on <strong>Exterminating Angel</strong>, disappointed that it wasn&#8217;t all like this.</p>
<p>Why I&#8217;m submitting it to BadRep&#8217;s Jam in particular, though, is this: it is entirely from the point of view of the Old Testament&#8217;s Angel of Death, on a mission to kill the sons of Egypt, as per the Bible story. But it&#8217;s not just about that. Maybe it&#8217;s just Siouxsie&#8217;s delivery, or the fact that the lyrics are both about a story where only the sons of privilege count, and disdainful to the back teeth of that fact (&#8220;poor little rich thing&#8221;) &#8211; but I think the angel is very much coded as a vengeful female voice, enacting all the grisly, monstrous, destructive urges that are enshrined as natural in so many men and rarely if at all in women. &#8220;For the hell of it,&#8221; in fact. (VH1 asked Siouxsie not to perform it because it contains references to menstrual blood. Oh, and piss.)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s one of the Unwritten Rules of Siouxsie Sioux that on lyrical face value, one is often only ever half sure what she&#8217;s actually on about<sup><a href="/2012/09/14/musical-chairs-exterminating-angel-by-the-creatures/#footnote_0_12286" id="identifier_0_12286" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" For example, Christine. &ldquo;Now she&rsquo;s in purple, now she&rsquo;s the turtle&rdquo;, anyone? Yeah. This is coherent by comparison. ">1</a></sup>, but I think <strong>Exterminating Angel</strong> is a uniquely beautiful and ugly track. It resonates with me on a deeper level than the Banshees&#8217; single <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hMagNuhLkk"><strong>Cities In Dust</strong></a>, which is about the destruction of Pompeii and is similarly Big, Ancient and World-Ending in scope.</p>
<p>I Googled &#8220;angel of death female&#8221; to compare gendered representations of the angel in the story. Wikipedia popped up first, and helpfully listed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_(personification)">several countries</a> where folklore representations of Death more generally are female (death is a &#8220;she&#8221;, for example, in the folklore of some Slavic communities). But most of the results on my first page weren&#8217;t about the Bible story, or the angel figure, at all.</p>
<p>Instead, they were mainly about other things we apply the phrase &#8220;angel of death&#8221; to in a female-gendered way. Female serial killers abounded, along with headlines about women in the nursing profession (so often referred to in things like Marie Curie Cancer Care literature as &#8220;angels&#8221;) who ill-treated their charges. A few &#8220;sexy nurse &#8211; evil angel of death version with black dress!&#8221; fancy dress costumes completed the picture.</p>
<p>There was nothing particularly mythic or powerful about the way any of these women were framed by the &#8220;angel of death&#8221; phrase, though some were dangerous. And although the gender of mythic death personifications does vary worldwide, the overall tone of my research online about female iterations of this particular mythic and Biblical figure, taken as a whole, was often merely patronising. To get to anything useful, one needed a pair of Sexism Waders.</p>
<p>I think that says it all, really, about why this song mattered to me when I heard it. Female violence is so often either downplayed or fetishised &#8211; witness how long it took women to get to box at Olympic level &#8211; where in men it is normalised (at least as a cultural idea if not a legal reality). And Siouxsie&#8217;s angel is a sort of horrible challenge to that idea. There&#8217;s precisely nothing nice about her whatsoever. Hers is a grand cry of &#8220;Piss on it, I&#8217;m sick of it&#8221; &#8211; and although I&#8217;m generally a friendly sort who&#8217;s about as murderous as a bag of Haribo Starmix, I have a great many days when, re: the patriarchy at least, I can <em>certainly</em> get behind that sentiment.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[What the hell IS an ActiPearl, anyway?!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Hi, nice to meet you. You&#8217;re looking great today, really confident and independent, good for you! A shame about the smell, though. I mean, really, everybody&#8217;s noticed it. And we all know it&#8217;s coming from, ahem, <em>down there</em>.</p>
<p>“Oh no, no, it&#8217;s OK, don&#8217;t get offended, it&#8217;s not your fault. You can&#8217;t help it, I understand that. Your genitals are disgusting and they stink, especially when they&#8217;re bleeding and there&#8217;s nothing you can do about it. You didn&#8217;t ask to be born with such a terrible curse, and nobody expects you to take responsibility for it. Help is at hand, though! If you give me lots of money every month for forty years of your life, we can help! Because believe us, you need it&#8230;”</p>
<p>I will admit up front that I am not a trained marketer, but it&#8217;s plain to see that the above isn&#8217;t the most convincing of sales pitches. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s a far more honest pitch than <a title="Always ActiPearls official page" href="http://www.always-info.co.uk/whats-new/always-acti-pearls-pads.aspx">the current campaign for Always sanitary towels</a>, which proudly declare the addition of “odour neutralising ActiPearls” as the next step in the evolution of &#8220;feminine hygiene&#8221; products. What the ads coyly decline to mention is that they&#8217;ve taken lessons in odour neutralisation from the Lynx school of “synthetic chemical stench and hygiene are THE SAME THING.”</p>
<p>This is straight-up vagina-shaming. It&#8217;s insulting and inexcusable. And giving me yet another reason to be pissed off when I&#8217;m already simmering with ire about the massacre going on between my legs is inadvisable. So congratulations, P&amp;G: you&#8217;ve lost my custom for the next thirty years.</p>
<p>The packaging claims to “neutralise odours rather than just masking them”. This is at best a delicate glossing over of the truth. It&#8217;s impossible to tell whether “odours” (those vaginal FIENDS!) are neutralised or not because of the perfume.</p>
<p>Oh God, the perfume.</p>
<p>I appreciate that scent perception can be a highly subjective thing, so I&#8217;ll attempt to keep the description as general as possible. Cloying, synthetic, sweet florals with an undertone of disinfectant, false and stereotypically feminine. It hits you as soon as you open the packaging, before even unwrapping the first towel. A scent that lingers for hours even if you switch to an unscented brand immediately after using one of these. A scent that does not mask menstrual blood, but mingles with it into a nauseating aberration.</p>

<p>The problems presented by this are manifold, but there are three main ones that leapt out at me. Bullet point list time? Bullet point list time!</p>
<ul>
<li>The obvious implication that people who have vaginas are utterly clueless about personal hygiene and how to take care of themselves, plus the completely ignoring the fact that vaginas are self cleansing and look after themselves without much intervention from their owners beyond showering/bathing regularly. The idea that menstruation makes a person malodorous or otherwise “dirty” is an outdated and misogynistic notion. If a vagina IS smelling bad, whether through illness or neglect, adding an unpleasant artificial scent to the crotch is only going to make the problem worse.</li>
<li>Following on from this, people who are at least vaguely aware of their sexual health can tell from changes in vaginal scent if something untoward or unusual is going on. Trying to cover that up with perfumes isn&#8217;t going to help anybody stay in touch with their genitalia.</li>
<li>The choice of such a blatantly &#8220;overt femininity-pink-and-flowers-BECAUSE-THIS-PRODUCT-IS-FOR-GIRLLLSSS&#8221; fragrance risks alienating trans* men and genderqueer customers who choose to use these products. As if the patronising “have a happy period, always” slogan weren&#8217;t bad enough. Not only are Always trying to insist that a reminder of nature not necessarily assigning the genitalia that most closely match an individual&#8217;s gender identity should be a matter for celebration, but also that everybody should smell like a field full of artificial blossoms when their loins are creating underpant carnage. Way to consider the needs of your whole customer base, there.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, at the risk of incurring violent flames, I&#8217;ll admit that I am not the biggest fan of my vagina. I appreciate the vast capacity for pleasure that it and its associated physiological paraphernalia provide, but for the most part our relationship is one of tacit acknowledgement and grudging acceptance. This does not mean, however, that I do not appreciate the inherent beauty and wonder of such genitalia.</p>
<p>A vagina should smell like a vagina. A vagina should not smell of roses or perfumes or <a href="http://londonfeminist.com/site/femfresh-fail/">any number of artificial masking agents</a>. Every healthy vagina has a personality and life all of its own and scent to match.</p>
<p>At a time where in the USA, the wealthy, middle-aged, cis-male elitists running the country seem determined to drive women&#8217;s bodily autonomy and sexual rights back into the Victorian era, now seems a very prudent time to turn our eyes to our genitals and send a clear message to politicians and megabucks sanitary product manufacturers alike that our bodies belong to nobody but ourselves. Their efforts to undermine and deny our sexuality will be met with the resistance and fight it deserves, until they back the hell off what&#8217;s between our legs.</p>
<p>If we really must accept defeat and acknowledge that we are no longer capable of keeping our own vaginas spring-fresh, then our next step is clear: begin a campaign to <a title="Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab Perfumes" href="http://www.blackphoenixalchemylab.com/">Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab</a> to produce their own range of sanitary towels impregnated with their gorgeous scents. Because if my vagina isn&#8217;t allowed to smell like a vagina any more, it can do a hell of a lot better than Procter and Gamble&#8217;s sickly synthetic flower bleach.</p>

					<description><![CDATA['Ovary' hopped onto the semantic stage around 1658 meaning 'the female organ of reproduction in animals, in which ova or eggs are produced' (ova being the Latin plural form of ovum = egg).]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6 style="text-align: center;">O</h6>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">OVARY</h2>
<h3>Oh! Darling.</h3>
<p><em>Ovary</em> hopped onto the semantic stage around 1658 meaning &#8216;the female organ of reproduction in animals, in which <em>ova </em>or eggs are produced&#8217; (<em>ova </em>being the Latin plural form of <em>ovum </em>= egg). Eggs, of course, are now generally recognised as a crucial part of reproduction in all species (a chicken ovulates every day, fact fans), making the <em>ovary </em>rather important for the construction of little&#8217;uns. Straightforwardly, the word derives from <em>ovarium: </em>&#8216;ovum&#8217; + &#8216;-arium&#8217; (aquarium, oceanarium, planetarium, toastarium). Consistency: it&#8217;s helpful. But hold! 1658? Really? What about before? Was there some mass genital evolution in the late seventeenth century that made early modern cisgendered Woman so drastically different from her medieval sisters?</p>

<p>Well no, but there was an evolution in what Scientists considered &#8220;Woman&#8221; to be. For hundreds of thousands of years previous, the established thinking had been that they were simply men &#8216;turned outside-in&#8217;: female genitals were held &#8216;up there&#8217; by a colder body temperature than their male counterparts, and, thus, sex differences were a matter of degree. Women were men who hadn&#8217;t quite unfurled properly.</p>
<h3>Oh My God</h3>
<p>With this thinking, the <em>vagina</em> became an inverted penis, the <em>labia</em> a foreskin, the <em>uterus </em>a scrotum, and the <em>ovaries</em> testicles – and all these now-familiar gynecological terms date from the same period: the <span style="color: #000000;">oft-maligned</span> <em>vagina</em> (= &#8216;sheath&#8217;) is faux-Latin from 1680,<em> labia</em> (= &#8216;lip&#8217;) slightly earlier (1630s) and <em>uterus</em> the earliest, from 1610 (although, <span style="color: #000000;"><a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/11/22/an-alphabet-of-femininism-8-h-is-for-hysteria/">as already mentioned in these pixellated pages</a></span>, it was conflated with the gender-neutral &#8216;womb&#8217; or &#8216;belly&#8217;, its original Latinate meaning). Pre-seventeenth century <em>ovaries </em>were consequently referred to as &#8216;female testicles&#8217; or &#8216;stones&#8217;, and the synonymity was so literal as to accept the possibility that if a girl got too hot through strenuous exercise, her entire reproductive system could <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XR2BcRwiG-sC&amp;pg=PA127&amp;lpg=PA127&amp;dq=marie+germain+montaigne&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wUFyuQjNb2&amp;sig=ljtQ1Xb5-TMH8RfJfyae_XtbgGg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=plY8TYLHBpGYhQeqjJGxCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=marie%20germain%20montaigne&amp;f=false">accidentally pop out and turn her into a boy</a>.</p>
<p>So if sex was a false distinction to make, how did male and female manage to breed? Seventeenth-century scientists approached this question firstly through <a href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/aris-bio/">Aristotle</a> and his theory of epigenesis (= &#8216;origin through growth&#8217;). Aristotle reckoned male semen gave the embryo its form, and female menstrual blood supplied the raw materials.<sup><a href="/2011/01/24/an-alphabet-of-femininism-15-o-is-for-ovary/#footnote_0_1950" id="identifier_0_1950" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" Yes, menstrual blood. ">1</a></sup> The &#8216;soul&#8217; enters the embryo at the moment the mother first feels the baby kick.</p>
<p>However, by suggesting new people can spring into being organically, epigenesis risks dispensing with divine involvement. Not cool. So a much <span style="font-size: 13.2px;">more palatable alternative, for seventeenth-century scientists, was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spermist_theory">preformation</a> (the idea that the parents&#8217; seed already contained a miniature adult, so <a href="http://www.hps.cam.ac.uk/visibleembryos/s1_4.html">all the embryo has to do is increase in size</a>). Bit creepy, right? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaas_Hartsoeker">Nicolaas Hartsoeker</a> (1656-1725) was well into this idea and even claimed he could see these &#8216;homunculi&#8217; through the microscope (above, right).</span></p>
<p>But once this had been agreed, there came the inevitable Swiftian debate about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilliput_and_Blefuscu">how you like your eggs</a>, with scientists divided into &#8216;aminalculists&#8217; and &#8216;ovists&#8217;: those who were with Hartsoeker in believing the &#8216;germ&#8217; of life to be in the sperm, and those who preferred the &#8216;egg&#8217; (= &#8216;the female&#8217;). Arguing in favour of the latter was the (understandable) confusion about why God would be so wasteful as to create thousands of Hartsoekerean sperm-germs to be lost on every egg-ward excursion for the sake of one single fertilization: from the outside, the female looked a bit more efficient.</p>
<p><strong>Oh! You Pretty Things</strong></p>
<p>But clearly, all this Knowledge was better on the subject of males than females (and even the women themselves were hard pressed to explain menstruation or recognise pregnancy): <span style="font-size: 13.2px;"><em>ova </em>were still shrouded in mystery, and <em>ovulation </em>a great unknown – it was not even certain whether human females could conceive without orgasm, or if they were more like cats, rabbits, llamas (now known as &#8216;induced ovulators&#8217;) and, er, men. Official advice erred on the side of caution and recommended that both man and wife reach orgasm during procreation – as a side-effect, a rapist could get off scott-free if his victim fell pregnant, since, until the nineteenth century, the law worked backwards and considered conception to imply enjoyment and, therefore, consent.</span></p>
<p>It is William Harvey (1578-1657), most famous for &#8216;discovering&#8217; the circulation of the blood, who is commonly credited with realising the importance of an <em>ovary</em>-thing, and the frontispiece to his treatise on the subject blazons th<span style="font-size: 13.2px;">e tag &#8216;<em>ex ovo omnia</em>&#8216; (&#8216;everything from the egg&#8217;). But he was thinking less of a modern day &#8216;<a href="http://www.theodora.com/anatomy/the_ovum.html">egg cell</a>&#8216; and more of a &#8216;spirit&#8217;: an <em>egg</em> was the mother&#8217;s &#8216;idea&#8217; of a fetus which was &#8216;ignited&#8217; in her womb during sex. It was a general generative catalyst, not technical anatomy – as is clear from the image (below, left).</span></p>

<h3><strong>Oh My Gosh</strong></h3>
<p>After kicking around for just over a century, <em>ovary</em> suddenly became enshrined in anatomy books as an independent organ that somehow encapsulated &#8216;woman&#8217;: in 1844 Achille Chereau declared that &#8216;it is only because of the ovary that woman is what she is&#8217; (oh dear). In part, this was to do with a retreat from the previous centuries&#8217; idea that women and men were anatomically the same and an advance towards the notion that sex equalled gender (a surprisingly modern invention, if you listen to <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Making-Sex-Gender-Greeks-Freud/dp/0674543556/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1294676447&amp;sr=8-1">Thomas Laqueur</a>). With this came an increasing focus on specifically &#8216;women&#8217;s&#8217; problems via <em>hysteria </em>(= <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/11/22/an-alphabet-of-femininism-8-h-is-for-hysteria/">&#8216;womb trouble&#8217;</a>), and, neatly (if disturbingly) a favourite cure for this pre-Freud was the <em>bilateral ovariotomy</em>, also dubbed &#8216;female castration&#8217;: removing a patient&#8217;s healthy <em>ovaries </em>to man them up a bit (just as men become &#8216;feminized&#8217; through removal of the testicles). The <em>ovariotomy </em>would thus, it was believed, act not just as a cure for hysteria, but also for behavioural pathologies including nymphomania, and even general aches and pains. Of course, it also stopped menstruation, rendered women infertile and carried risks endemic to c19th surgery methods. WE DON&#8217;T KNOW WHAT THIS DOES, SO LET&#8217;S JUST TAKE IT OUT.</p>
<p>It was not until the 1930s that scientists got near a hormonal understanding of <em>ovulation</em>, how it worked and how it could be controlled. Here we really should give a nod to that symbol of 1960s sexual liberation: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_oral_contraceptive_pill">combined oral contraceptive pill</a>, a great source of division between parents and children, as epitomised in the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/dec/13/people-inspired-pop-songs-muses">backstory</a> to the seminal Beatles song <strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lG3nXyI41M">She&#8217;s Leaving Home</a> </strong>(1967). See, children of the 1920s and 30s must have found the idea of their daughters silently and imperceptibly controlling their <em>ovulation</em> terrifying, whereas the children of the 1960s saw such control as simple empowerment. In miniature, this gives us the whole history of <em>ovary </em>and its linguistic cognates: what cannot be seen is inevitably free for appropriation by a host of meanings. Meaningarium.</p>
