										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>They decline to reveal the smallest details, aiming to maintain total secrecy. They will say only that most of the band members met at the small protests held by Russia’s once-feeble opposition, from monthly illegal demonstrations calling for the right to assembly to banned gay pride marches.

&#8211; <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/feb/02/pussy-riot-protest-russia"><strong>Guardian</strong>, 2nd February 2012</a></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://pussy-riot.livejournal.com/profile"><strong>Pussy Riot</strong></a>, like the Sex Pistols, have a name designed to make headlines, and a bit more political substance to back up the sensationalism. Formed in Moscow last September, this offshoot of Russia’s complex and fractured political scene has come to prominence in the UK media in the context of <a href="http://www.channel4.com/news/undemocratic-putin-sparks-russias-opposition">protests</a> against political corruption which have been gaining in volume and intensity after parliamentary elections last December. In mid-January, one of the collective’s impromptu guerrilla gigs, taking place on Red Square opposite the Kremlin, ended with its members <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/9028106/Russian-all-girl-punk-band-Pussy-Riot-arrested-for-performing-Vladimir-Putin-song.html">detained by police</a>.</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/qEiB1RYuYXw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/feb/03/pussy-riot-kremlin-protest-riot-grrrl">Laura Barton in the <strong>Guardian</strong></a>, picking up on the band’s citing of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bikini_Kill">Bikini Kill</a> as an inspiration, offers a slightly short-sighted view of 90s Riot Grrrl as an antecedent for the expression of &#8216;an alternative female voice&#8217;. While the group clearly do reference Riot Grrrl’s &#8216;tone of wild irreverence&#8217;, it also makes sense to consider Pussy Riot in the context of the former Soviet Union&#8217;s long and fascinating history of political protest coalescing around <em>avant garde</em> art and music, especially punk. Adam Curtis&#8217; <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/adamcurtis/2012/01/the_years_of_stagnation_and_th.html">recent blog</a> is an interesting attempt to make sense of this sort of determinedly oppositional culture which has been notable by its <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/nov/10/protest-music-akala-grace-petrie">relative absence</a> from the UK&#8217;s current wave of socio-political protest. Similarly, the clash of sartorial signifiers which Pussy Riot provide by combining miniskirts and stockings with ski-masks and balaclavas could be a legacy of Riot Grrl too, but as a practical measure it has as much in common with other Anonymous-style contemporary protest movements, not to mention the general history of <a href="http://theoccupiedtimes.co.uk/?p=2259">masking and disguise in protest</a>.</p>
<p>Russia does have a long tradition of women in protest, notably the <a href="http://www.oocities.org/mushkah/WomenRevolution.html">1917 revolution </a>in which women played a prominent part, encouraged by the <a href="http://writerinterviews.blogspot.com/2008/06/ana-siljak.html">intersection </a> of socialism with many of the goals of women’s liberation. Pussy Riot cite this ‘deep tradition&#8230; of gender and revolution – we&#8217;ve had amazing women revolutionaries.’ They add that ‘the revolution should be done by women&#8230; For now, they don&#8217;t beat or jail us as much’. This assertion ties in with <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-sUOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA144&amp;lpg=PA144&amp;dq=women+protesters+history+impunity&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gfiH9oiQKN&amp;sig=RQ5cWgISBTk4MMmPz-6sYc8joT8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=54EuT7eMAuit0QX_lLGtCA&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=women%20protesters%20history%20impunity&amp;f=false">historical debates</a> on the ability of women to take part in protest or civil disobedience with a greater degree of impunity than men &#8211; an ideal which <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-16267436">isn&#8217;t always borne out</a> by the treatment of female protesters.</p>
<p>Contemporary Russian politics &#8211; like any &#8211; are <a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v34/n01/stephen-holmes/fragments-of-a-defunct-state">not a straightforward matter</a>, and the extent of Pussy Riot&#8217;s relevance and representativeness remains to be seen. But in a context where growing and disparate opposition groups are encountering heavy and often violent repression across the world, the ways in which women participate in protest, and the styles of self-expression they employ, are always worth noting.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last winter&#8217;s wave of student and youth protests held many points of interest, but one of the most amusing was the <strong>Daily Mail</strong>&#8216;s pearl-clutching front page on what it chose to call <a href="http://news.infoshop.org/article.php?story=20101125032637445"><em>Rage of the Girl Rioters</em></a>, in which it claimed that &#8216;rioting girls&#8217; had become &#8216;the disturbing new face of violent protest&#8217;. While the article betrayed predictable anxieties about social protest in general, the visible presence of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/mar/08/terrify-middle-england-young-women">female agency</a> was an ingredient that occasioned a particularly salacious shock.</p>

Contrary to the fears of Middle England, this is nothing new &#8211; we have, like John Sullivan&#8217;s comic creation, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMKsR_wUSfA">been revolting for years</a>. Centuries, in fact, from the demonstrations by upper class <a href="http://www2.stetson.edu/~psteeves/classes/pomeroy.html">Roman women</a> in protest at state restrictions on their use of luxury goods, through the involvement of women of all classes in the <a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/chap5a.html">French Revolution</a>, the <a href="http://www.oocities.org/mushkah/WomenRevolution.html">Russian Revolution</a>, and the great <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9862643/ns/us_news-life/">civil rights struggles</a> of the twentieth century (left), to female participation in the current unrest in <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/mar/11/arab-women-revolutionised-egypt-tunisia-yemen">Tunisia</a>, <a href="http://www.doublex.com/blog/xxfactor/women-are-substantial-part-egyptian-protests">Egypt</a>, <a href="http://womenofhistory.blogspot.com/2011/04/yemeni-women-protest.html">Yemen</a>, <a href="http://www.nowpublic.com/world/libya-women-protest-derna-call-ouster-gaddafi">Libya</a>, and <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/aug/24/chile-student-leader-camila-vallejo">Chile</a>. We have marched, struck, rioted, occupied, petitioned, organised and agitated not only on behalf of our own interests as women, but also as part of broader social movements and collective actions, both peaceful and violent, carried out for social, political and economic reasons.</p>
<p>Often women&#8217;s involvement in protest has drawn on their gendered role within families and communities. Women played a significant part, for instance, in the <a href="http://www.enotes.com/food-encyclopedia/food-riots">riots over food supply, quality and price</a> which swept Europe during its transition to a capitalist market economy from the 16th century to the 19th. Historians like <a href="http://libcom.org/tags/temma-kaplan">Temma Kaplan</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._P._Thompson">E P Thompson</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_Zemon_Davis">Natalie Zemon Davis</a> (and, er, me) have seen female participation in these protests as an extension of their role in the sexual division of labour, including food procurement and preparation, which lent legitimacy and authority to their involvement. The prominence of women in local networks of communication, and their presence in social centres like market squares as part of their daily routine, also allowed them to collectively mobilise and organise &#8211; the equivalent, under agrarian capitalism, of creating a Facebook Events page. </p>

There&#8217;s even a Wikipedia list of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_women_who_sparked_a_revolution">female rebel leaders</a> dating from the 9th century BC to this year&#8217;s uprising in Ivory Coast, which, even though this series is concerned less with individuals and more with women&#8217;s mass participation in protest, is still pretty cool.</p>
<p>Just as their presence is still being obscured in reports of current events in the Middle East, so women have historically been absent from many popular and academic accounts of protest. The advent of feminist-influenced social history from the mid-20th century sought to correct masculine bias within traditional narratives of labour history or liberal teleologies, both of which had marginalised or misrepresented the involvement of women. Conversely, strictly purist or doctrinaire feminist narratives of history have also tended to ignore popular movements which did not advance a specifically feminist programme, regardless of how heavily women may have been involved. Both of these approaches resulted in the omission, until recently, of women from the histories of protest movements like <a href="http://www.ohio.edu/chastain/rz/womchart.htm">Chartism </a>in which they played a significant part.</p>
<p>The place and properness of women in protest has long been a bone of contention, with discourse surrounding their involvement portraying them as hysterical, unwomanly, deviant, or deranged. Sheila Rowbotham, in her historical <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Women-Resistance-Revolution-History-Modern/dp/0394719549/ref=sr_1_8?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1303679377&amp;sr=1-8">study </a>of women and protest, notes that: </p>
<blockquote><p>It is at the point where the revolution starts to move women out of their passivity into the conscious and active role of militants that the mockery, the caricatures, the laughter with strong sexual undertones begin. </p></blockquote>
<p>The vicious alarmism and mockery drawn by female involvement in politics, with which suffragists and civil rights agitators found themselves contending, is already evident in several cartoons on female <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobin_(politics)">Jacobins</a> and campaigners for constitutional reform. Political cartoons of the 18th and 19th century were rarely noted for their subtlety, and caricaturists tended to focus upon the disorderly nature of political females, as well as imputing to them an &#8216;unwomanly&#8217; loose or aggressive sexuality. Cruikshanks depicted <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/cruikshank.jpg">&#8216;The Female Reformers of Blackburn&#8217;</a> as vulgarly outspoken and blowsily dressed, distastefully dominating their political platform, and J L Marks&#8217; <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/reform.jpg">&#8216;Much Wanted: A Reform Among Females!!!&#8217;</a> gives its female protagonists suggestively brandished rolled-up papers, poles clutched between their knees, and &#8211; oh yes &#8211; hands clasped in their laps to form a gaping dark hole, setting out their desire to usurp male power as well as their own wantonness. As, perhaps, does the presence of all those upthrust pikes, swords and cannons in <a href="http://www.historywiz.com/womensmarch.htm">depictions </a>of the women&#8217;s march to Versailles. And of course Cath Elliot&#8217;s recent piece on <a href="http://toomuchtosayformyself.com/2011/04/20/an-occupational-hazard/">online harassment</a>, by which politically uppity women are impugned as frigid, or sluts, or lesbians, provides a piquant reminder of this glorious tradition.</p>

Their involvement does not take place in a vacuum &#8211; women protest not only as women but for multiple reasons of sectional interest, and the gender identification of protestors has historically generated conflict and tension with identities based on race, class, sexuality, and ideology. To take just one example, the involvement of women in 20th century <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittston_Coal_strike">industrial </a> <a href="http://www.socresonline.org.uk/12/1/spence.html">conflict</a>, acting in support of or solidarity with male industrial workers, has been criticised by some feminists who view such conflict as manifestations of an unhelpfully macho patriarchal culture from which women should separate themselves.</p>
<p>Nor can it be assumed that female involvement in social protest will naturally result in an outcome which is cognisant of, sympathetic to, or even comfortable for women. After the Women&#8217;s March to Versailles, women as revolutionaries became a potent symbol of the power of the French Revolution, and the young Republic was eventually personified in the figure of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marianne">Marianne</a>. But, as <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KxnoWDM3ga8C&amp;lpg=PA178&amp;ots=oYOdatQ1ax&amp;dq=%22joan%20b%20landes%20marianne&amp;pg=PP1">Joan Landes</a> has argued, Marianne&#8217;s visual prominence did not mean that women obtained significant political, social, or economic advantages during the French Revolution; the new Republic&#8217;s politics was one of laws and texts in which Marianne&#8217;s image bore no concrete significance. Similar tensions are apparent in the complex relationship of Iranian women with the <a href="https://www.msu.edu/user/hillrr/161lec27.htm">after-effects</a> of the 1979 revolution, and the contention that the presence of women in the current &#8216;Arab spring&#8217; uprisings, when acknowledged at all, is being <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/apr/02/arab-women-protesters">appropriated and used symbolically</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the examples given in links above, this series will look in greater detail at case-studies of women&#8217;s involvement in social, political, and economic protest, their motivations and methods, their successes and setbacks. It&#8217;s been a long, hot summer of discontent and it shouldn&#8217;t be any surprise to see women as well as men taking their place in the sun.</p>
