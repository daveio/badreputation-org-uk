					<description><![CDATA[So, the first episode of HBO’s Game of Thrones, adapted from the popular George R R Martin books, has now aired. How is it?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, the first episode of HBO’s <strong>Game of Thrones</strong>, adapted from the popular <strong>George R R Martin</strong> books (a series of gritty low-fantasy books about the battle for control of a kingdom and the threat of wintery Others from the North), has now aired. How is it? We’ll get to that in a moment.</p>
<p>What’s been almost more interesting than the content of the show itself has been the response from critics. Ginia Bellafante kicked things off in the <a href="http://tv.nytimes.com/2011/04/15/arts/television/game-of-thrones-begins-sunday-on-hbo-review.html"><strong>New York Times</strong></a>, labelling the show as “boy-fiction”, and suggesting that the standard HBO sex has been thrown in to appeal to otherwise disinterested female viewers. Because obviously boys like swords and fighting and girls like sex and drama. That’s how gender works, right? Wait, no.</p>
<p>Annalee Newitz at <a href="http://uk.io9.com/5792574/really-why-would-men-ever-want-to-watch-game-of-thrones"><strong>io9</strong></a> argues back, but instead of dismissing the whole notion of gender essentialism and stories that are “for” one gender or another Newitz takes it the other way, arguing that this is clearly a tale for women. Oh, wait, perhaps it’s a satirical exaggeration of the idea, to highlight the ridiculousness of Bellafante’s review. Well, hopefully it is. It still doesn’t get around the issue of thinking people of any particular gender are wired to want certain things from their fiction, though.</p>
<p>Ilana Teitalbaum weighs in with a more straightforward critique of the ways in which Bellafante’s review is terribly misguided over at the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ilana-teitelbaum/game-of-thrones-hbo_b_850014.html"><strong>Huffington Post</strong></a>, and probably provides the most sensible view on the discussion. I’m going to quote her here, because what she says is worth repeating for anyone too lazy to click through the links.</p>
<blockquote><p>The characterization of fantasy as &#8220;boy fiction&#8221; is offensive to the genre and offensive to women. That we for the most part will only read what Oprah has picked, and especially if a woman wrote it, is a stereotype that is not only demeaning to women &#8212; it is also untrue…</p>
<p>…When we categorize books as &#8220;boy fiction&#8221; and &#8220;girl fiction&#8221; it&#8217;s just another way to promote gender stereotyping. It is predicated on the assumption that people will only read books that reflect their personal experiences, so therefore women will only deign to read about dating, shopping, and kitchen intrigues.</p></blockquote>
<p>Okay, with that said, on to the show itself. Trying to avoid spoilers here, but apologies if any slip through. As an adaptation, it&#8217;s generally pretty damn solid. There are the inevitable minor changes that come with translating a work to screen, but there are none of the glaring alterations that make you stand up and go “They did what? But that’s totally out of character! Did they even read the books?” The casting is good (<strong>Harry Lloyd</strong> as Viserys Targaryen is palpably creepy and unpleasant), the costumes are well done, and Arya Stark and Tyrion Lannister already shine as the best characters. Arya Stark gets painfully little screen time though, which leads to the first issue with the show.</p>
<div style="width: 314px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img loading="lazy" class=" " src="https://i1.wp.com/30.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lc9kgjPaNh1qb3n99o1_500.jpg?resize=304%2C457" alt="Promotional picture from Game of Thrones. Danaerys, a young blonde woman, stands in front of a horse." width="304" height="457" data-recalc-dims="1" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Danaerys Targaryen being blonder than thou.</p></div>
<p>The female characters, as of the first episode, do not get much representation. Hopefully this is a temporary thing and, like the books, we’ll get to see Arya, Danaerys, Catelyn etc grow into being hugely important badasses that sit firmly at the centre of key plot points. But right now they’re just not there. They get scarcely any screen time, and when they are shown they’re mostly cast in passive, receptive roles. Tyrion Lannister (<strong>Peter Dinklage</strong>) sleeps with a prostitute (because it’s not a HBO show without frequent sex and nudity) who gets more lines than Cersei Lannister and Arya Stark put together.</p>
<p>And Danaerys… Okay, this falls on the book as much as the adaptation, and it’s hard to see a way they could have worked around it, but her initial role as a tool for her brother’s plans, without any say in her own life, feels very awkward. Two scenes in particular are awkward enough to be uncomfortable to watch. First there’s the close up of a nude Danaerys (<strong>Emilia Clarke</strong>) being examined by her brother (and bear in mind this is a character written as being just thirteen in the book, though thankfully HBO seem to have aged her up a bit), to make sure she’s up to scratch for bartering away in exchange for an army, with oddly lingering shots of nipples and buttocks. This scene, which really should convey &#8220;look how bloody nasty and unpleasant Viserys is,&#8221; instead comes off more as &#8220;and here are some breasts, do you like them?&#8221;</p>
<p>And then we have the consummation of the marriage to the head of said army, Khal Drogo of the Dothraki, a scene that is shown to be even more upsetting and non-consensual than it was originally written. And it was pretty damn bad to start with. The scene is at least short, and cuts away before anything graphic, but it does raise the question of why someone at HBO thought “Hmm, what this scene needs is to be made a bit more rapey.” Seriously, there is pretty much never a time when this is a good thing for a piece of fiction. Ever.</p>
<p>Still, as said, there is hope that the characters will develop along the same lines they did in the book, so this issue might be a passing one. The second problem, though, is less likely to improve with future episodes.</p>

<p>The second issue, you see, is the unfortunate race failure. You could argue that it’s just being faithful to the books, but honestly that’s not much of an excuse. Everyone is oh so very white, and everyone we’re told is attractive (Cersei, Jaime, Danaerys) is oh so very blonde to boot. The closest we get to non-white characters are the slightly-tanned Dothraki horsemen with whom Viserys is trying to forge an alliance. And, of course, they’re depicted as crude savages. And I don’t mean “they’re a bit misunderstood” &#8211; we’re talking full on “these people are barbaric, they are not like us.” We see two men fighting over a woman, one literally pushing the other away mid-thrust and hopping on himself (which is a whole other pile of issues), before blades are drawn and someone gets disembowelled. True to the books it may be, but there’s a definite problem with a world where everyone is divided into groups of “white people” and “savages”.</p>
<p>Issues aside, it’s worth sticking with. If nothing else it’ll be interesting to see how they handle the events that happen to Eddard Stark, what with <strong>Sean Bean</strong> being their big name cast member.</p>
