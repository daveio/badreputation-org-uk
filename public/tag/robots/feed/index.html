										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Exciting news! My very favourite film, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_in_the_Sky"><strong>Laputa</strong></a> (aka <strong>Castle In The Sky</strong>) has just appeared on YouTube with its rare original English dub rather than the grotesque Disney version featuring James Van Der Beek. This is, of course, bad and wrong and you definitely shouldn&#8217;t go and watch it all.</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/sheeta.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="9632" data-permalink="/2012/02/01/laputa-skypirates-against-the-patriarchy/sheeta/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/sheeta.jpg?fit=480%2C272&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="480,272" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Sheeta" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/sheeta.jpg?fit=300%2C170&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/sheeta.jpg?fit=480%2C272&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-9632" title="Sheeta" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/sheeta-300x170.jpg?resize=300%2C170" alt="Sheeta, with flying machine frame in background. Copyright Studio Ghibli 1986" width="300" height="170" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/sheeta.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/sheeta.jpg?w=480&amp;ssl=1 480w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>It&#8217;s the first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_Ghibli">Studio Ghibli</a> film proper, and it&#8217;s a corker, containing two reasonably kickass female characters, a steam train chase, skypirates, magic crystals, airships, a mysterious floating city and some damn fine robots. It&#8217;s a sort of steampunk sci-fi ecofable. It even has a section set in what is clearly a parallel universe Welsh mining town, inspired by Hayao Miyazaki&#8217;s trip to Wales and interest in the miners&#8217; strike in the early 1980s.</p>
<p>Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli can generally be relied upon for more interesting and resourceful <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2011/jul/14/studio-ghibli-arrietty-heroines">heroines</a> than your average Disney or Pixar fodder, even if they are a bit, er identically similar. But in <strong>Laputa</strong> you can read the whole film as a condemnation of patriarchal power. Seriously – the government, the military and the monarchy line up against a girl and her male friend (who represent the future, protecting one another and fighting alongside each other as equals) and a band of pirates captained by a truly formidable woman.</p>
<p>There is a bit of a science vs nature theme, but it&#8217;s not clear cut, as the pirates rely on technology as much as the military do. Technology and nature are shown to be in harmony in the great overgrown gardens of the ancient city of Laputa, tended for centuries by a solitary robot.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to the womens. Orphan Sheeta is the central character, and although she might at first seem more passive than the Ghibli girls to come in <strong>Spirited Away</strong>, <strong>My Neighbour Totoro</strong> and <strong>Howl&#8217;s Moving Castle</strong>, she is quietly courageous, getting in a fair bit of fighting, struggling, attacking, escaping and running away. In the dramatic first minutes of the film, for example, she acts boldly and bravely and strikes out against her captors:</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/mMBHGma-3lQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth bearing in mind that <strong>Laputa</strong> came out in 1986, and Sheeta represented a fairly significant departure from your average anime heroine at that point. As well as being smart, resourceful and brave, Sheeta is powerful. Interestingly, she inherits this power &#8211; in the form of the &#8216;levitation stone&#8217;, a secret true name and powerful magic spells &#8211; from her mother.</p>
<p>Although her counterpart, the headstrong Pazu, styles himself as her protector, and does do a bit of rescuing, the traditional gender roles are blurred. Rebecca Johnson highlights this in her essay <a href="http://rhizomes.net/issue14/johnson/johnson.html">Kawaii and kirei: Navigating the Identities of Women in &#8216;Laputa: Castle in the Sky&#8217; by Hayao Miyazaki and &#8216;Ghost in the Shell&#8217; by Mamoru Oshii</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Even the role reversal displayed between Sheeta and Pazu is prominent, questioning the notion of gender roles that men and women take. For example, Sheeta tries to protect Pazu after their initial capture by the army, denying that she needs help. In this instance, both characters are &#8220;damsels in distress&#8221; since they are both under the threat of the army. Instead of taking on a traditional role as a damsel, Sheeta takes on the male role of protector.</p></blockquote>

Copyright Studio Ghibli 1986" width="300" height="168" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/dola-hat.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/dola-hat.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/dola-hat.jpg?w=550&amp;ssl=1 550w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>There are also two scenes in which Pazu cooks for them both, which is a little thing, but it makes me happy. Go go normalizing atypical gender behaviours!</p>
<p>In the climactic scene they stand side by side, holding hands as equals, and act together as their (feminine) compassion compels them to an act of terrific (masculine) violence and destruction in which they sacrifice themselves for the greater good.</p>
<p>The other main female character, piratical matriarch Dola, is just wonderful. She&#8217;s a bit like Granny Weatherwax crossed with Desperate Dan. Here she is outsmarting, outfighting and outrunning her burly band of sons (she appears around five minutes in):</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/N2fU-J_UYo4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>My favourite bit is the way she discards her skirt when things start to kick off. Rebecca Johnson sees Dola as a particularly radical character in the context of the dominant social ideals of Japanese womanhood. As she says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dola treats the world around her as personal territory without fear or hesitancy. Leading her family, a band of pirates, she is a take charge woman who shows her Japanese audience that women are more than capable of casting away the kawaii syndrome plaguing them&#8230;</p>
<p>The Japanese word for mother is &#8220;okasan&#8221; which literally means &#8220;the person at the back of the house&#8221;. However, it is safe to assume that Dola, as her sons&#8217; captain, is far from being &#8220;the woman at the back of the house.&#8221; Really, Dola is defying the common stereotype of Japanese women because her success is not being measured in terms of the motherly and wifely capabilities by which many contemporary Japanese women are judged. The common Japanese phrase &#8220;women are weak but mothers are strong&#8221; is one-sided, and proved wrong by Dola. Her characterization and actions show that she is not only a strong mother but a smart and strong woman in her own regard too.</p></blockquote>
<p>For all her ferocity and ruthlessness, Dola does have a compassionate side and becomes deeply protective of the two orphans once they have proved themselves to her. <a href="http://www.arcadean.com/?p=58">Arcadean</a> has an interesting analysis of Dola&#8217;s shifting gender identity, although I don&#8217;t completely agree with it.</p>
<p>Even now the film fills me with wonder, and the original score and use of silence (intolerable to Disney, apparently) is full of beauty. It left a lasting impression, and is probably responsible for my interest in anime and manga, and certainly for my profound love of robots. And I reckon you could do a lot worse on the role model front than Sheeta and Dola.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Everyone has a favourite cyborg, right? Well mine is Alita, from Yukito Kushiro’s manga series <strong><a title="Wikipedia - Battle Angel Alita" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Angel_Alita" target="_self">Battle Angel Alita</a></strong>. She is a strong female character in both senses of the word: strong because she’s brave, independent, tough, smart and compassionate, but also in the enjoyable ‘I-can-punch-your-head-off’ way.</div>
<h3>What’s the story?</h3>
<div>The series is set in a 26th century dystopia, and revolves around the city of Scrapyard, grown up around a massive heap of rubbish that rains down from Tiphares, a mysterious city floating above. ‘Surface dwellers’ are barred from Tiphares, and must make lives for themselves amid the scrap. Alita is found in the garbage heap by cybernetics doctor and part-time bounty hunter Daisuke Ido, who rebuilds her body and takes care of her. She remembers nothing about who she was or how she came to be in the Scrapyard, but she does discover a talent for killing which leads her to join Ido as a bounty hunter. The story continues over nine volumes as Alita attempts to rediscover her past and struggles to reconcile her identity as girl and killer, human and machine, individual and soldier.</div>

<div>So far, so Nineties. So why am I writing about <strong>Battle Angel Alita</strong> now? Well, because <a title="IMDb - James Cameron" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000116/" target="_self">James Cameron</a> is about to start making a live action/CGI film adaption of it and I want AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE to read it before that happens. While there’s a lot to love in Cameron’s films, I am concerned he’s going to turn an intelligent, philosophical and political story about identity into Hot Robot Chick (With A Heart Of Gold) Kicks Ass In The Future.</div>
<h3>Genderfun</h3>
<div>First of all, Alita is no balloon-breasted manga stereotype – while she does have an unnaturally &#8216;perfect&#8217; body and is beautiful in a childlike way, she is very rarely drawn in an overtly sexual style, and spends most of her time fully clothed, often in a trenchcoat and suitably stompy boots.</div>
<div>Secondly, though tiny and feminine (at times, anyway) she is supremely strong, still a powerful cultural dream in a world where violence against women is epidemic. Refreshingly she rarely relies on guns, instead using a cyborg martial art &#8211; sidestepping the ‘bigger than yours’ approach to women kicking ass.</div>
<div>Thirdly, the series further departs from convention with a powerful female protagonist that a) never uses her beauty, sexuality or other feminine wiles to get the upper hand and b) is never raped or nearly raped or avenging somebody else’s rape.</div>
<div>That said, the series does explore issues around bodily integrity, control over the boundaries of the self and the intimate operations of power, and there is a definite gendered aspect to this. For example, at one point troubled genius and desert DJ (yes, DJ &#8211; it&#8217;s complicated&#8230;) Kaos saves Alita’s life by repairing her body and she wakes up naked on an operating table with his hand inside her.</div>
<div>I’m not saying that <strong>Battle Angel Alita</strong> is a feminist work, or that it will be everyone’s cup of tea – it is extraordinarily violent, for one thing. For another it is inescapably problematic that Alita derives her physical strength from mechanical bodies created or enhanced by men &#8211; Ido, Kaos and mad scientist Desty Nova. Nonetheless, when the chips are down she is often saved by her resourcefulness and her connections with others.</div>
<div>
<div id="attachment_751" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Alita-gun.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-751" data-attachment-id="751" data-permalink="/2010/11/02/battle-angel-alita-and-cyborg-feminism/alita-gun/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Alita-gun.png?fit=300%2C185&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="300,185" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Alita with gun, copyright Yukito Kushiro 1996" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Alita-gun.png?fit=300%2C185&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Alita-gun.png?fit=300%2C185&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-751" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Alita-gun.png?resize=300%2C185" alt="Scanned page section of Battle Angel Alita Vol 6, copyright Yukito Kushiro 1996 (reproduced under fair dealings review exemption)" width="300" height="185" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-751" class="wp-caption-text">Yes, I know she has a gun in this one. She just doesn&#39;t use them *all the time*, ok? Copyright Yukito Kushiro 1996</p></div>
<div>In the last few books her key relationships are with women &#8211; her Tipharean ‘operator’ Lou and 13 year old professional gambler Kokomi. At the start Lou is everything Alita isn&#8217;t &#8211; silly, chatty, timid &#8211; but she is inspired to a tremendous act of rebellion to save her friend&#8217;s life. Kokomi is also inspired by Alita, and though they end up fighting on different sides she is similarly independent, brave and rebellious.</div>
<div>Another thing I love about Alita is that although she is a powerful and inspiring female character there is nothing maternal about her impulse to protect others. Her power is not rooted in her female identity because her ‘femaleness’ is superficial. And in my opinion the real triumph is that she is not like a man either. She has masculine and feminine qualities, but neither is she purely androgynous.</div>
<h3>Cyborg Feminism</h3>
<div>Whether or not Alita fits the bill as a feminist hero, cyborgs and feminism go way back. In 1985 <a title="Wikipedia - Donna Haraway" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Haraway" target="_self">Donna Haraway</a> wrote her ironic <strong><a title="Stanford - Cyborg Manifesto" href="http://www.stanford.edu/dept/HPS/Haraway/CyborgManifesto.html" target="_self">Cyborg Manifesto</a></strong>, which pointed a way forward for feminism which didn’t rely on the artificial unity of ‘femaleness’:</div>
<blockquote>
<div>There is nothing about teeing &#8216;female&#8217; that naturally binds women. There is not even such a state as &#8216;being&#8217; female, itself a highly complex category constructed in contested sexual scientific discourses and other social practices. Gender, race, or class consciousness is an achievement forced on us by the terrible historical experience of the contradictory social realities of patriarchy, colonialism, and capitalism.</div>
</blockquote>
<div>The cyborg is an interesting political metaphor for Haraway, allowing for the possibility of connection but resisting the reductive tendencies of identity politics.  &#8216;Woman&#8217; (like &#8216;Black&#8217; or &#8216;disabled&#8217; or &#8216;working class&#8217;) is never a whole identity but a partial one &#8211; individual identities are made of myriad aspects and intersecting experiences, part natural-biological and part social-cultural construct. Haraway sees a way through this old problem of collective action by suggesting a cyborg feminism which finds its common ground in a desire to resist and subvert a patriarchal system and not in a shared female identity.</div>
<div>Haraway famously concludes her Manifesto with the words “I’d rather be a cyborg than a goddess.” I have nothing against goddesses (on the contrary, they rawk) but linking women’s power to nature or to their bodies is a dangerous game.</div>
<div>Alita is radically free from biological determinism in the way that only a cyborg can be. Every part of her is completely remade or regenerated in the course of the series, only her consciousness remains continuous. She is not her body, she is not even her brain.
