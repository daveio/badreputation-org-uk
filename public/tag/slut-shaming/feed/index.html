					<description><![CDATA[When the call came around for horror-themed posts for autumn and winter, I decided to take on the Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter series.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Early December. The leaves have fallen, the sky has darkened. Rain lashes the windows. Doors yawn open before you; blackness whispers chill secrets into your hair, and your worst nightmares take shape &#8216;twixt the smoky trees, taunting, menacing. Waiting.</p>
<p>Basically, at the time of writing it was the month with Hallowe&#8217;en in it, and I hate to waste a perfectly good theme. So without further ado, allow me to welcome you to <strong>Hopeless Reimantic Presents</strong>! In this column I&#8217;ll be going in-depth into the works of specific authors who are in &#8211; or cross over into &#8211; the romance genre. In the spirit of the season, I thought we&#8217;d take a look at the stuff of nightmares: let&#8217;s talk about Laurell K. Hamilton. More specifically, let&#8217;s talk about <strong>Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter</strong>, one of the weirdest and most controversial series I&#8217;ve ever interacted with.</p>

<p>First of all, a slightly complicated preface. Before I ever picked up an Anita Blake book I knew quite a lot about them, and while I&#8217;d like to stress that I&#8217;m here to talk about the <em></em>books and <em>not</em> Ms Hamilton herself I feel like I&#8217;ll be remiss if I don&#8217;t at least give a quick summary of some common controversies surrounding the series and its author.</p>
<p>I first became aware of Laurell K. Hamilton via Anne Rice. Well, not Anne Rice herself, but <a href="http://www.journalfen.net/community/fandom_wank/515245.html?nc=911" target="_blank">the now-infamous Anne Rice Author Tantrum</a>, which I arrived at a couple of years after the fact and consequently saw linked to&#8230;Laurell K. Hamilton&#8217;s <a href="http://eragon-sporkings.wikispaces.com/Hamiltons_Response_To_Negative_Readers" target="_blank">similarly poor handling of criticism</a> (link to a Wikispace article, as the original blog post has vanished).</p>
<p>Hamilton isn&#8217;t quite as vitriolic in her I Can&#8217;t Believe Not Everyone Likes My Book-ness, but she&#8217;s still pretty irritatingly condescending, although I do agree with her that if someone&#8217;s taking their book up to you so that you can sign it, then opening with &#8220;I hated this one and what you&#8217;ve done with the series&#8221; is kind of poor form.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s since made a name for herself on Twitter for calling her critics <a href="https://twitter.com/LKHamilton/status/200273311530360832" target="_blank">sexually frustrated</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/LKHamilton/status/200272147720056832" target="_blank">jealous</a> <a href="http://lkh-lashouts.livejournal.com/562684.html#cutid1" target="_blank">wannabes</a>, and a name for herself among readers and other writers for<a href="http://mybookgoggles.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/authors-behaving-badly-laurell-k.html" target="_blank"> not handling criticism well </a>and <a href="http://www.likesbooks.com/cgi-bin/bookReview.pl?BookReviewId=9647" target="_blank">shamelessly inserting herself into her books</a>. The <a href="http://lkh-lashouts.livejournal.com/" target="_blank">LKH_lashouts</a> community on LiveJournal keeps a nice catalogue of her various posts, blogs and misdemeanours, and I&#8217;ve been on it all day, which might explain why my brain is starting to feel too heavy for my skull.</p>
<p>As a lot of you probably aren&#8217;t familiar with what makes the Anita Blake series so divisive in the first place, I&#8217;ll give you a quick, neutral description to start us off (don&#8217;t worry, we&#8217;ll get to the incoherent ranting later). The <strong>Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter</strong> series started out as a kind of monster-of-the-week dealio, with some romance in it but not a huge deal. The romantic &#8211; and sexual &#8211; content of the books got a lot more page time as the series went on, and the tenth book in the series, <strong>Narcissus In Chains</strong>, saw a metaphysical event turn Anita Blake into a succubus who needs sex to survive.</p>
<p>Subsequent books are arguably more &#8220;paranormal erotica&#8221; than anything else, and the last time I checked in with Ms Blake she was in a polyamorous relationship with five guys and happy as a clam. This, and the fact that a lot of the events of Anita Blake&#8217;s love life seem to mirror the author&#8217;s, have led to accusations that Laurell K. Hamilton is using Anita to brag about how much sex she&#8217;s having, and have turned a lot of readers off the series.</p>
<p>The upshot of all this is that this time three months ago, your intrepid romance novel enthusiast knew <em>of</em> Laurell K. Hamilton and had formed a pretty strong impression of the <strong>Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter</strong> books &#8211; but had never actually picked one up. So when the call came around for horror-themed posts for autumn and winter, and I decided to take them on, I was&#8230;nervous, but excited. Here was a series with a strong female lead which had lost popularity as the erotic content had upped and the quality of the writing had deteriorated &#8211; the stuff of feminist bad-porn-lovers&#8217; wildest dreams, right?</p>
<p>All that given due consideration, I wanted to approach the series with an open mind, but I didn&#8217;t want to actually buy any of the books because a) this isn&#8217;t somebody I want to give money to and b) there are approximately bleventeen of the damned things and I don&#8217;t have a job. I put out a call on my social medias for donations to the cause.</p>
<p>Three weeks later, I had <em>seventeen Laurell K. Hamilton books</em>. And with various deadlines coming up? I had a week to read them in.</p>
<p>Some would have panicked. Some would have faltered. Some would have done several noisy circuits of the living room, sobbing about the hilarious injustice of life. Some would have said, &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s okay, I don&#8217;t have to read all of these, I&#8217;m not <em>that</em> much of a masochist&#8221;, picked out a selection, and called it a day.</p>
<p>I did all of these things except the last one. Here&#8217;s how I got on. The following are my initial notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Initial thoughts on LKH: The Anita Blake series is not as bad as I thought it would be for the reasons I was told I would hate it, but it is creepingly terrible in ways I didn&#8217;t really anticipate.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Day 3 of LKH immersion. Eyes gritty. Legs heavy. Some subcranial tenderness. Seem to have &#8220;What Does The Fox Say&#8221; stuck in my head.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Laurell K. Hamilton Immersion Week, Day 5. Sore throat, some muscle ache. Have been reading some of the earlier books, which are much better even if I don&#8217;t like murder mysteries that much. I&#8217;m sad that her deep love of stuffed penguins seems to be worn away by all the sexy sexy sex she starts having in a book or so&#8217;s time. What happened to Sigmund, Anita? Did Sigmund mean nothing to you? Developing protective feelings for all penguins.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>LKH Immersion Week, Day 6. I&#8230;I just don&#8217;t even know anymore, you guys. Just leave me alone. I&#8217;m going shopping for leather.</p></blockquote>
<p>By the end of the week I&#8217;d contracted a stomach virus, although the medical jury is still out on whether or not this was a symptom of my burgeoning lycanthropy. The next full moon isn&#8217;t until December 17th, so I guess we&#8217;ll find out then.</p>
<p>This is going to be a difficult bit of analysis to write, because &#8211; well, I read seventeen books, you guys. I&#8217;m having to be extremely choosy about which books I quote and why. Maybe I&#8217;ll upload a list of Supplementary Supportive Material, but, um, I wouldn&#8217;t count on it.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, dear readers, here&#8217;s the thing: <em>I didn&#8217;t hate these books the way I was expecting to</em>.</p>
<p>Look, fourteen-year-old me assumed I&#8217;d hate these books because they were a self-insert Mary-Sue-type series that ended with the main character having far too much ridiculously improbable sex and being the best at everything. Fourteen-year-old me was also scared of non-monogamy, kind of selective in her feminism and a lot more judgmental. Fourteen-year-old me would probably have written this bit of the article in a far more entertainingly vitriolic manner.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you&#8217;re stuck with twenty-three-year-old me, and twenty-three-year-old me doesn&#8217;t have a problem with any of these things on principle. Look, okay, self-insert Mary-Sues aren&#8217;t my cup of tea, and I can see why a sharp rise (hurr) in sexual content in a series which basically had no sexual content at all for the first four books might turn readers off &#8211; but those two facts don&#8217;t make either of those authorial decisions inherently wrong.</p>
<p>For all her flaws (and she has many &#8211; and I&#8217;m not just talking about the fun kind of flaws that make a character seem real, either) Anita Blake has some nice bits of refreshingly feminist outlook. One of the best story arcs in the series comes in <strong>Danse Macabre,</strong> when she has a pregnancy scare. She talks it over with all of her partners, one of them says he&#8217;ll stay at home and raise the baby so that she can keep working, and another says he&#8217;ll marry her:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Jesus, Mary and Joseph, Richard, is that all you think it takes to fix this? Marry me so the baby won&#8217;t be a bastard, and it&#8217;s all better?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see anyone else offering marriage,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s because they know I&#8217;ll say no. Every other man in my life understands that this isn&#8217;t about marriage. It&#8217;s about the fact that we may have created a little person. And we need to do whatever is best for that little person. How will marrying anyone make this work better? &#8230; What do you think having a baby will do to me, Richard? Do you think just because I have a baby I&#8217;ll become this other person? This softer, gentler person? Is that what you think?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8211; Laurell K. Hamilton, <strong>Danse Macabre</strong>, pp. 162-164</p></blockquote>
<p>Whatever else I think about Anita Blake the character, I wholeheartedly rooted for her throughout this story arc. Would it have been unrealistic for her to keep being a federal agent who has all the sex and also a baby? Sure, maybe. But this is a fantasy series and clearly delineated as such, so if that&#8217;s too much suspension of disbelief for you then <a href="http://fuckyeahscifiwomenofcolour.tumblr.com/post/37413846476/author-scott-lynch-responds-to-a-critic-of-the" target="_blank">allow me to refer you to Scott Lynch</a>.</p>
<p>Regarding the non-monogamy&#8230;well, there are not a lot of mainstream series that won&#8217;t even touch non-monogamy with a bargepole, and twenty-three-year-old me quite likes the normalisation of non-mono and monogamous relationships here. What I&#8217;m basically trying to say here is that if Laurell K. Hamilton wants to chronicle her sexy adventures as Badass The Vampire Slayer (And Harem) and people want to read it, I&#8217;m honestly okay with that. I wish she&#8217;d be more honest about what her books are (she seems to do a lot of If You Don&#8217;t Like It You&#8217;re Just Too Mainstream For My Awesomeness-ing), but &#8211; whatever. Fine.</p>
<p>However. The fact that I didn&#8217;t hate these books for the reasons I&#8217;d assumed doesn&#8217;t mean that they in no way made me want to tear my own eyes out. Unfortunately this article is skittering dangerously close to its word limit, so stand by for <strong>Part Two</strong>, in which I attempt to explain why cleanly and concisely but inevitably deteriorate into wordless, feeble sobbing.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t wait! See you then.</p>
