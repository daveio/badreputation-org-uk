					<description><![CDATA[When the call came around for horror-themed posts for autumn and winter, I decided to take on the Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter series.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Early December. The leaves have fallen, the sky has darkened. Rain lashes the windows. Doors yawn open before you; blackness whispers chill secrets into your hair, and your worst nightmares take shape &#8216;twixt the smoky trees, taunting, menacing. Waiting.</p>
<p>Basically, at the time of writing it was the month with Hallowe&#8217;en in it, and I hate to waste a perfectly good theme. So without further ado, allow me to welcome you to <strong>Hopeless Reimantic Presents</strong>! In this column I&#8217;ll be going in-depth into the works of specific authors who are in &#8211; or cross over into &#8211; the romance genre. In the spirit of the season, I thought we&#8217;d take a look at the stuff of nightmares: let&#8217;s talk about Laurell K. Hamilton. More specifically, let&#8217;s talk about <strong>Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter</strong>, one of the weirdest and most controversial series I&#8217;ve ever interacted with.</p>

(Via Marvel Wiki.)</p></div>
<p>First of all, a slightly complicated preface. Before I ever picked up an Anita Blake book I knew quite a lot about them, and while I&#8217;d like to stress that I&#8217;m here to talk about the <em></em>books and <em>not</em> Ms Hamilton herself I feel like I&#8217;ll be remiss if I don&#8217;t at least give a quick summary of some common controversies surrounding the series and its author.</p>
<p>I first became aware of Laurell K. Hamilton via Anne Rice. Well, not Anne Rice herself, but <a href="http://www.journalfen.net/community/fandom_wank/515245.html?nc=911" target="_blank">the now-infamous Anne Rice Author Tantrum</a>, which I arrived at a couple of years after the fact and consequently saw linked to&#8230;Laurell K. Hamilton&#8217;s <a href="http://eragon-sporkings.wikispaces.com/Hamiltons_Response_To_Negative_Readers" target="_blank">similarly poor handling of criticism</a> (link to a Wikispace article, as the original blog post has vanished).</p>
<p>Hamilton isn&#8217;t quite as vitriolic in her I Can&#8217;t Believe Not Everyone Likes My Book-ness, but she&#8217;s still pretty irritatingly condescending, although I do agree with her that if someone&#8217;s taking their book up to you so that you can sign it, then opening with &#8220;I hated this one and what you&#8217;ve done with the series&#8221; is kind of poor form.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s since made a name for herself on Twitter for calling her critics <a href="https://twitter.com/LKHamilton/status/200273311530360832" target="_blank">sexually frustrated</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/LKHamilton/status/200272147720056832" target="_blank">jealous</a> <a href="http://lkh-lashouts.livejournal.com/562684.html#cutid1" target="_blank">wannabes</a>, and a name for herself among readers and other writers for<a href="http://mybookgoggles.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/authors-behaving-badly-laurell-k.html" target="_blank"> not handling criticism well </a>and <a href="http://www.likesbooks.com/cgi-bin/bookReview.pl?BookReviewId=9647" target="_blank">shamelessly inserting herself into her books</a>. The <a href="http://lkh-lashouts.livejournal.com/" target="_blank">LKH_lashouts</a> community on LiveJournal keeps a nice catalogue of her various posts, blogs and misdemeanours, and I&#8217;ve been on it all day, which might explain why my brain is starting to feel too heavy for my skull.</p>
<p>As a lot of you probably aren&#8217;t familiar with what makes the Anita Blake series so divisive in the first place, I&#8217;ll give you a quick, neutral description to start us off (don&#8217;t worry, we&#8217;ll get to the incoherent ranting later). The <strong>Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter</strong> series started out as a kind of monster-of-the-week dealio, with some romance in it but not a huge deal. The romantic &#8211; and sexual &#8211; content of the books got a lot more page time as the series went on, and the tenth book in the series, <strong>Narcissus In Chains</strong>, saw a metaphysical event turn Anita Blake into a succubus who needs sex to survive.</p>
<p>Subsequent books are arguably more &#8220;paranormal erotica&#8221; than anything else, and the last time I checked in with Ms Blake she was in a polyamorous relationship with five guys and happy as a clam. This, and the fact that a lot of the events of Anita Blake&#8217;s love life seem to mirror the author&#8217;s, have led to accusations that Laurell K. Hamilton is using Anita to brag about how much sex she&#8217;s having, and have turned a lot of readers off the series.</p>
<p>The upshot of all this is that this time three months ago, your intrepid romance novel enthusiast knew <em>of</em> Laurell K. Hamilton and had formed a pretty strong impression of the <strong>Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter</strong> books &#8211; but had never actually picked one up. So when the call came around for horror-themed posts for autumn and winter, and I decided to take them on, I was&#8230;nervous, but excited. Here was a series with a strong female lead which had lost popularity as the erotic content had upped and the quality of the writing had deteriorated &#8211; the stuff of feminist bad-porn-lovers&#8217; wildest dreams, right?</p>
<p>All that given due consideration, I wanted to approach the series with an open mind, but I didn&#8217;t want to actually buy any of the books because a) this isn&#8217;t somebody I want to give money to and b) there are approximately bleventeen of the damned things and I don&#8217;t have a job. I put out a call on my social medias for donations to the cause.</p>
<p>Three weeks later, I had <em>seventeen Laurell K. Hamilton books</em>. And with various deadlines coming up? I had a week to read them in.</p>
<p>Some would have panicked. Some would have faltered. Some would have done several noisy circuits of the living room, sobbing about the hilarious injustice of life. Some would have said, &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s okay, I don&#8217;t have to read all of these, I&#8217;m not <em>that</em> much of a masochist&#8221;, picked out a selection, and called it a day.</p>
<p>I did all of these things except the last one. Here&#8217;s how I got on. The following are my initial notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Initial thoughts on LKH: The Anita Blake series is not as bad as I thought it would be for the reasons I was told I would hate it, but it is creepingly terrible in ways I didn&#8217;t really anticipate.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Day 3 of LKH immersion. Eyes gritty. Legs heavy. Some subcranial tenderness. Seem to have &#8220;What Does The Fox Say&#8221; stuck in my head.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Laurell K. Hamilton Immersion Week, Day 5. Sore throat, some muscle ache. Have been reading some of the earlier books, which are much better even if I don&#8217;t like murder mysteries that much. I&#8217;m sad that her deep love of stuffed penguins seems to be worn away by all the sexy sexy sex she starts having in a book or so&#8217;s time. What happened to Sigmund, Anita? Did Sigmund mean nothing to you? Developing protective feelings for all penguins.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>LKH Immersion Week, Day 6. I&#8230;I just don&#8217;t even know anymore, you guys. Just leave me alone. I&#8217;m going shopping for leather.</p></blockquote>
<p>By the end of the week I&#8217;d contracted a stomach virus, although the medical jury is still out on whether or not this was a symptom of my burgeoning lycanthropy. The next full moon isn&#8217;t until December 17th, so I guess we&#8217;ll find out then.</p>
<p>This is going to be a difficult bit of analysis to write, because &#8211; well, I read seventeen books, you guys. I&#8217;m having to be extremely choosy about which books I quote and why. Maybe I&#8217;ll upload a list of Supplementary Supportive Material, but, um, I wouldn&#8217;t count on it.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, dear readers, here&#8217;s the thing: <em>I didn&#8217;t hate these books the way I was expecting to</em>.</p>
<p>Look, fourteen-year-old me assumed I&#8217;d hate these books because they were a self-insert Mary-Sue-type series that ended with the main character having far too much ridiculously improbable sex and being the best at everything. Fourteen-year-old me was also scared of non-monogamy, kind of selective in her feminism and a lot more judgmental. Fourteen-year-old me would probably have written this bit of the article in a far more entertainingly vitriolic manner.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you&#8217;re stuck with twenty-three-year-old me, and twenty-three-year-old me doesn&#8217;t have a problem with any of these things on principle. Look, okay, self-insert Mary-Sues aren&#8217;t my cup of tea, and I can see why a sharp rise (hurr) in sexual content in a series which basically had no sexual content at all for the first four books might turn readers off &#8211; but those two facts don&#8217;t make either of those authorial decisions inherently wrong.</p>
<p>For all her flaws (and she has many &#8211; and I&#8217;m not just talking about the fun kind of flaws that make a character seem real, either) Anita Blake has some nice bits of refreshingly feminist outlook. One of the best story arcs in the series comes in <strong>Danse Macabre,</strong> when she has a pregnancy scare. She talks it over with all of her partners, one of them says he&#8217;ll stay at home and raise the baby so that she can keep working, and another says he&#8217;ll marry her:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Jesus, Mary and Joseph, Richard, is that all you think it takes to fix this? Marry me so the baby won&#8217;t be a bastard, and it&#8217;s all better?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see anyone else offering marriage,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s because they know I&#8217;ll say no. Every other man in my life understands that this isn&#8217;t about marriage. It&#8217;s about the fact that we may have created a little person. And we need to do whatever is best for that little person. How will marrying anyone make this work better? &#8230; What do you think having a baby will do to me, Richard? Do you think just because I have a baby I&#8217;ll become this other person? This softer, gentler person? Is that what you think?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8211; Laurell K. Hamilton, <strong>Danse Macabre</strong>, pp. 162-164</p></blockquote>
<p>Whatever else I think about Anita Blake the character, I wholeheartedly rooted for her throughout this story arc. Would it have been unrealistic for her to keep being a federal agent who has all the sex and also a baby? Sure, maybe. But this is a fantasy series and clearly delineated as such, so if that&#8217;s too much suspension of disbelief for you then <a href="http://fuckyeahscifiwomenofcolour.tumblr.com/post/37413846476/author-scott-lynch-responds-to-a-critic-of-the" target="_blank">allow me to refer you to Scott Lynch</a>.</p>
<p>Regarding the non-monogamy&#8230;well, there are not a lot of mainstream series that won&#8217;t even touch non-monogamy with a bargepole, and twenty-three-year-old me quite likes the normalisation of non-mono and monogamous relationships here. What I&#8217;m basically trying to say here is that if Laurell K. Hamilton wants to chronicle her sexy adventures as Badass The Vampire Slayer (And Harem) and people want to read it, I&#8217;m honestly okay with that. I wish she&#8217;d be more honest about what her books are (she seems to do a lot of If You Don&#8217;t Like It You&#8217;re Just Too Mainstream For My Awesomeness-ing), but &#8211; whatever. Fine.</p>
<p>However. The fact that I didn&#8217;t hate these books for the reasons I&#8217;d assumed doesn&#8217;t mean that they in no way made me want to tear my own eyes out. Unfortunately this article is skittering dangerously close to its word limit, so stand by for <strong>Part Two</strong>, in which I attempt to explain why cleanly and concisely but inevitably deteriorate into wordless, feeble sobbing.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t wait! See you then.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Guest blogger Alyson Macdonald on why Gillen and McKelvie's Young Avengers is your new superhero comic to watch. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li><em><strong>Alyson Macdonald</strong>, who blogs for <a href="http://brightgreenscotland.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Bright Green</strong></a>, sent us this post. Do you have a guest post brewing in your brain? You know the drill: email us on <a href="mailto:badrepeditors@gmail.com">badrepeditors@gmail.com</a>.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Last week&#8217;s long-awaited, big-release comic was Kieron Gillen and Jamie McKelvie&#8217;s <strong>Young Avengers #1</strong>, a classic coming-of-age story about a group of 18-year-olds who just happen to be superheroes.</p>
<p>While many mainstream comics are still producing the kind of material that gets sent up on <a href="http://eschergirls.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Escher Girls</a> and <a href="http://thehawkeyeinitiative.com/" target="_blank">The Hawkeye Initiative</a>, Gillen and McKelvie actively reject the kind of objectification that gives the genre such a bad reputation amongst feminists. In contrast to the stereotypical tits-and-ass fare, the opening sequence of <strong>Young Avengers</strong> provides the reader with a three-page essay on the (straight/bi) female gaze. In a medium that overwhelmingly caters for straight male desires, this is a rare demonstration of how to do a sexy scene with decent gender politics.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2013/01/31/guest-post-young-avengers-1-sex-and-the-female-gaze/ya1/" rel="attachment wp-att-13060"><img data-attachment-id="13060" data-permalink="/2013/01/31/guest-post-young-avengers-1-sex-and-the-female-gaze/ya1/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/YA1.jpg?fit=1073%2C1665&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1073,1665" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="YA1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/YA1.jpg?fit=193%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/YA1.jpg?fit=659%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-13060 aligncenter" alt="YA1" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/YA1.jpg?resize=580%2C899" width="580" height="899" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/YA1.jpg?w=1073&amp;ssl=1 1073w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/YA1.jpg?resize=193%2C300&amp;ssl=1 193w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>On page one, Kate Bishop wakes up in an unfamiliar bed, having just hooked up with a man whose name she can&#8217;t quite remember. At this point anyone who&#8217;s familiar with comics, or popular culture in general, would expect to see some slut-shaming, or at least some titillating semi-nudity, but we get neither. Kate is dressed in a t-shirt which comes down to her mid-thigh, and it&#8217;s clear that she has no regrets, thinking: <em>For a second, some part of me thinks, “I should be ashamed.” I think that part of me is really stupid. </em></p>
<p>In the fourth panel we even see Kate smiling as she thinks back to the earlier part of her evening, and it&#8217;s the smile of someone who has just got laid and is pretty damned pleased with herself.<br />
The second page introduces us to Noh-Varr, whose bed Kate has woken up in, and this is where we see another convention subverted, because he&#8217;s the one in nothing but his underwear. In an interview with <a href="http://www.comicsalliance.com/2013/01/23/young-avengers-interview-kieron-gillen-jamie-mckelvie/#ixzz2IodBaUVn" target="_blank">Comics Alliance</a>, artist Jamie McKelvie explains the idea behind this scene:</p>
<blockquote><p>We&#8217;ve long had a problem in comics where the women are &#8220;sexy&#8221; (in a sexist fashion) and the men aren&#8217;t. Time to redress the balance. And there&#8217;s a big difference between sexist and sexy.</p></blockquote>

<p>Although male superheroes are usually drawn with extremely muscular physiques, it&#8217;s not normally sexualised in this way – the reader is supposed to want to <em>be</em> them, not have sex with them. This is a rare acknowledgement that people who fancy men read superhero comics too.</p>
<p>But rather than providing equality of objectification, the aim here is to have a sexy scene which enhances the story and doesn&#8217;t devalue either of the characters. If you&#8217;re enjoying the view of Noh-Varr in his underwear, it&#8217;s just a bonus, not the entire point of the sequence; if you&#8217;re not into it, his lack of clothes is incidental. As Gillen puts it in <a href="http://kierongillen.tumblr.com/post/40045596084/meet-the-team-marvel-boy" target="_blank">an introduction to the character of Noh-Varr</a> on his Tumblr:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;characters being sexy is cool but objectification in the process is bullshit. An inability to see the difference is a fundamental weakness. My wife’s in the next room watching Lord of the Rings, and I guarantee she’s thinking sexy thoughts about Aragorn. But that works without anything which annihilates him as a character, y’know?</p></blockquote>
<p>The reader is supposed to see this scene through Kate&#8217;s eyes, and as she watches Noh-Varr dancing around in his pants, it acknowledges the existence of the female gaze, both through Kate&#8217;s interest in watching him, and the <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice" target="_blank">fanservice</a> of the artwork.</p>
<p>Noh-Varr has a masculine appearance, but – perhaps because he&#8217;s an alien from another dimension – he doesn&#8217;t appear to be burdened with ideas of conventional masculinity, as we can see from his music choices. The comic&#8217;s title page states that the record he puts on is &#8216;Be My Baby&#8217; by the Ronettes (incidentally, this is the track played over the opening titles of the film <strong>Dirty Dancing</strong>, which is also about <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2013/01/09/guest-post-found-feminism-rewatching-dirty-dancing/">female sexual awakening</a>), and he talks about his enthusiasm for “close harmony girl groups” in a way that a heterosexual Earth man probably wouldn&#8217;t, because he&#8217;d be afraid of seeming effeminate. The play on gender roles is, of course, entirely deliberate, as one of the major influences in this version of the character is David Bowie during his androgynous, bisexual-identifying period in the early 1970s.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2013/01/31/guest-post-young-avengers-1-sex-and-the-female-gaze/ya3/" rel="attachment wp-att-13062"><img data-attachment-id="13062" data-permalink="/2013/01/31/guest-post-young-avengers-1-sex-and-the-female-gaze/ya3/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/YA3.jpg?fit=1043%2C1067&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1043,1067" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="YA3" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/YA3.jpg?fit=293%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/YA3.jpg?fit=1000%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-13062" alt="YA3" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/YA3.jpg?resize=526%2C538" width="526" height="538" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/YA3.jpg?w=1043&amp;ssl=1 1043w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/YA3.jpg?resize=293%2C300&amp;ssl=1 293w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/YA3.jpg?resize=1000%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 526px) 100vw, 526px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>As Kate watches Noh-Varr, the scene is interrupted by a Skrull attack (Skrulls are a species of warrior aliens that occasionally pop up in the Marvel Universe to attack either Earth or Noh-Varr&#8217;s species of warrior aliens). If this was a horror movie, this would be the moment where Kate&#8217;s decision to go back to Noh-Varr&#8217;s place for sexytimes gets her killed in a disgustingly graphic way, but rather than being punished for her naughty behaviour, Kate is rewarded with another adventure, when she pilots the space ship.</p>
<p>As well as understanding what many female fans want to see, Gillen also accepts that sometimes our appreciation goes beyond what&#8217;s on the page:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ever since our work on <a href="http://www.phonogramcomic.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Phonogram</strong></a>, Jamie have [sic] strove to make our comics – for want of a better phrase – <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_fiction" target="_blank">slash-fic</a>-able. If you’re working in certain heroic fantasy genres, that’s part of the emotional churn.</p>
<p>(taken from Gillen&#8217;s <a href="http://kierongillen.tumblr.com/post/40045596084/meet-the-team-marvel-boy" target="_blank">tumblr post on Noh-Varr</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>Recent comic book adaptation movies like <strong>Avengers Assemble</strong> and <strong>X-Men:First Class</strong> have been gleefully adopted by fanfiction writers, who find that the gender imbalances and close friendships between male characters give them plenty of material to work with. While slash has sometimes been treated as fandom&#8217;s dirty secret, Gillen and McKelvie are obviously quite comfortable with it. The title page even provides a nod to fangirl culture by adopting their language: editors Jake Thomas and Lauren Sankovitch are credited with “LOLs” and “feels” respectively – that&#8217;s “humour” and “emotions” to anyone who isn&#8217;t up-to-date on their internet memes.</p>
<p><strong>Young Avengers</strong> clearly demonstrates something which I&#8217;ve long suspected to be true: it really is possible for male writers to “get” female fans. Although there are female comics creators producing work that doesn&#8217;t make women cringe – even with big publishers like Marvel and DC – it doesn&#8217;t mean that their male colleagues should have a free pass to be obnoxiously sexist. We should be holding more men to the pro-feminist standard that Gillen and McKelvie have set, not just in comics, but in all forms of pop culture.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was reading about the rivalry between Victoria&#8217;s Secret and Agent Provocateur the other day (as is my wont of a Thursday evening) and in the course of doing so I discovered this classic Agent Provocateur advert:</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/oXsdtrNlMMs" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>I quite like Agent Provocateur in general &#8211; while it&#8217;s a bit ridiculous in places (<a href="http://www.agentprovocateur.com/gentlemens-guide/the-adventurer/info/birthday-suit-playsuit~red" target="_blank">this</a> may be many things, but it is <strong>not </strong>a &#8216;playsuit&#8217;), I do feel like it&#8217;s positively targeted at strong, empowered women who like luxury lingerie, and their partners (the <a href="http://www.agentprovocateur.com/gentlemens-guide/the-expert.html" target="_blank">Gentleman&#8217;s Guide</a> for boyfriends on their website is quite amusing).</p>
<p>This may be because their creative director is herself a female force to be reckoned with: Sarah Shotton, who worked her way up the company from an &#8216;apprenticeship&#8217; when it had just started up. Now at the top, Shotton states that she tries every design she looks at on a size 8 model and a size 16, to ensure that it works on a range of shapes. No more than she should do, perhaps, but probably still more than many other lingerie designers. So I&#8217;m on side from the get-go, really.</p>
<p>But to the ad!</p>

<p>First things first, this has got to be in the minority among lingerie campaigns in that the female protagonist is active and capable. She&#8217;s not in a boudoir and she&#8217;s not being sexy for an imagined (male) viewer. I present <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KToRNZbG9W0&amp;feature=related" target="_blank">this from La Senza</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YbBbLrKM-Q" target="_blank">this from the M&amp;S &#8216;Autograph&#8217; lingerie</a> range for comparison.</p>
<p>For a more current spin, to my right is H&amp;M&#8217;s Winter 2012 print campaign. Oh look, it&#8217;s another woman in lingerie on a bed (/ weird sheepskin shebang), lit so you can&#8217;t actually see her face. For a more avant garde take on these same ideas, check out <a href="http://film.damaris.co.uk/filmchore-movie.html" target="_blank">this bizarre mini-film masterwork</a> from Damaris. Damaris, I love you dearly, but seriously, what is this?</p>
<p>Conversely, in the Agent Provocateur advert our heroine is out and about, and about to get on a bus. She&#8217;s wearing a wrap dress and plimsoles &#8211; well-dressed, but clearly not on any kind of Special Sexy Trip &#8211; and she also just happens to be wearing matching Agent Provocateur lingerie.</p>
<p>One effect of this decision is to make the underwear look practical. This is not true of most of Agent Provocateur&#8217;s range (or price tag). They&#8217;ve always been really into the idea of lingerie as a &#8216;special secret&#8217; (not Victoria&#8217;s).</p>
<p>The photography on their website is lit as if by searchlight to reinforce this, and this advert refines that a little, pushing lingerie as a secret just for you, the wearer. But, they&#8217;re arguing here, it&#8217;s also something viable for every day. Our protagonist is just hangin&#8217; out in her designer lingerie, because she wants to wear it &#8211; for herself.</p>
<p>Personally, I commend her: good underwear is the skeleton of an outfit, and I don&#8217;t see why, if you&#8217;re lucky enough to be able to buy luxury lingerie, it should have to languish at the bottom of a drawer until some performative Special Occasion.</p>
<p>But I think this ad &#8211; and its slogan, &#8216;sexy never takes a day off&#8217; &#8211; is also saying that there&#8217;s something almost intrinsic about &#8216;sexy&#8217;. In this advert, the Agent Provocateur underwear, and the choice to wear it out and about, is just an extension of the heroine&#8217;s natural confidence and, well, sexiness.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s this confidence that makes her actually embark on the chase in the first place. The underwear&#8217;s not making her sexy; she&#8217;s chosen the underwear because she already <em>is</em> sexy. Typical advertising, of course, but isn&#8217;t it better to see someone being sexy in their day to day life than backlit in a studio, lounging on a bed?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve moaned about shoddy sex education on BadRep <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/12/01/fighting-for-the-facts-about-abortion/">before</a>, but it&#8217;s back on my mind thanks to a recent <a href="http://www.brook.org.uk/professionals/application/brookpr/index.php?option=com_brookpr&amp;view=article&amp;id=91&amp;Itemid=640">survey by Brook</a> which showed that nearly half of secondary school pupils don’t think their sex and relationships education is fit for purpose. This has prompted a brace of new anti-sex education stories in the news (a typical example appeared in the <strong>Daily Mail</strong> last week<sup><a href="/2011/11/30/whos-afraid-of-sex-education/#footnote_0_8719" id="identifier_0_8719" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" Ed&rsquo;s note: I can&rsquo;t bear linking the Mail and am still in mourning for IstyOsty, but search and ye shall find; it&rsquo;s titled &ldquo;Casual Sex and &lsquo;Bad Touching&rsquo;: Guess What Your Eight Year Old Is Learning At School These Days&rdquo;. *facepalm* ">1</a></sup> and Education For Choice have responded <a title="Mythbusting Monday" href="http://educationforchoice.blogspot.com/2011/11/myth-busting-monday-teaching-children.html" target="_blank">here</a>) including one that caught me totally by surprise: a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-15877072">BNP protest outside a primary school</a> in Sheffield that had dared to extend SRE to all age groups. The what now? Are racism and xenophobia passé?</p>
<h3>Innocence and Sexualisation</h3>
<p>The vigour with which some people are prepared to attack moves towards more open, honest and comprehensive sex and relationships education is baffling. What are they so afraid of? Educating young people about safer sex doesn’t lead to an increased sexual activity (that’s from this great <a href="http://www.avert.org/aids-young-people.htm">Avert resource</a>, by the way). Two words that pop up fairly regularly in the fog of general objection are ‘innocence’ and ‘sexualisation’. I think they’re masking other, simpler causes for so much reactionary guff, but let’s have a look at them anyway.</p>

Innocence in the criminal sense is a good thing to hold on to, of course. But innocence in the wafty Victorian lamblike sense (aka “freedom from guilt or sin through being unacquainted with evil”)?.  I fail to see the value of being ‘unacquainted with evil’. Knowing about sex isn’t the same as having sex. And also: SEX ISN’T EVIL, GUYS. Besides, it’s a bit of a risk, if you ask me, turning someone loose in the world if they have no concept of evil. They’re in for a nasty shock and quite possibly some dangerous or exploitative situations. Likewise someone who has been kept in the dark about pregnancy, STIs or abuse. Even if you’re working with some kind of arcane points-based system of morality, how can you get your approval for being without sin just because you don’t know what sin is? That’s like congratulating someone on not eating the cookies they didn’t know were there.</p>
<p>Anyway, that’s enough poptheology. Next: ‘sexualisation’, on which I basically agree with <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/aug/09/stop-this-slut-shaming">Laurie Penny</a> that the word is a “troubling piece of cultural shorthand” which</p>
<blockquote><p>suggests that sexuality is something that is done to young women, rather than something that they can own and control: that they can never be sexual, only sexualised. This is not a helpful message to send to girls as they begin to explore their sexuality.</p>
<p>The moral panic over &#8220;sexualisation&#8221; assumes instead that sex is only ever damaging to young women, and that having sex or behaving sexually must be resisted for as long as possible. The problem is not, however, that young women are &#8220;growing up too fast&#8221; – rather it is that they are growing up to understand that they are erotic commodities, there to be used and abused, shamed if they express legitimate desires of their own, and taught to fear their own bodies.</p></blockquote>
<p>Child sexual behaviour is complex and difficult to discuss, but it <a href="http://www.pediatricsdigest.mobi/content/101/4/e9.full">exists</a>. Children have this weird habit of growing up. And it doesn’t work the way the <strong>Sun</strong> would have it &#8211; every girl is an innocent princess until a few moments past midnight on her 16<sup>th</sup> birthday, at which point it’s A-OK to start slavering over her. Seriously, until 2004 plenty of Page Three girls were 16. There were even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linsey_Dawn_McKenzie">16<sup>th</sup> birthday specials</a> in some other tabloids. Your, er… your double standard is poking out, by the way.</p>
<h3>Ewwww Isn&#8217;t Good Enough</h3>
<p>Critics of broader sex education have done a pretty good job of cosying up to some quarters of the feminist movement, and I’d love to believe that concern over women or children’s wellbeing lay at the heart of the <a href="https://www.education.gov.uk/publications/standard/publicationDetail/Page1/CM%208078">Bailey Review</a> and the media outrage. But it doesn’t. Sexual conservatism is shorthand for a certain kind of morality, and this is a holier-than-thou contest fuelled by the crippling shame and squeamishness about sex that is our shared cultural inheritance. That’s why we feel the need to keep any notion of sex away from children for as long as possible, because on some level, we do think there’s something bad about sex. What other explanation can there be? An otherwise sensible, right-on and feminist former manager of mine once insisted we end a teabreak conversation about how often you should have a sexual health checkup, saying &#8220;Can you just stop talking about it please? It makes me feel all ewwww.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, feeling &#8216;ewwww&#8217; has created a dangerous situation. Without giving children and teenagers a safe space in which to discuss and learn about sex, relationships and sexuality we are creating a vacuum that will be filled by three things: a) whatever their parents choose to tell them; b) all the shit teenagers talk to each other; and c) ideas about sex derived solely from cultural representations of it. Advertising and porn are the big guns here. The version of sex in most porn and advertising isn’t particularly safe, consensual, varied, respectful or even likely to be that much fun (good luck to any women planning on having an orgasm) and the additional messages it peddles about gender identity, power, race and sexual orientation are pretty unhelpful.</p>
<h3>Some Scary Numbers</h3>
<p>As well as the great Tory terror of teenage pregnancy *cue Hammer Horror evil laughter and lightning strike* this is a public health issue. Although last year there was a small decrease in the total number of STIs diagnosed in England, 2010 still clocked up <a href="http://www.hpa.org.uk/NewsCentre/NationalPressReleases/2011PressReleases/110615STIsdeclinefirsttimein10yrs/">418,598 new diagnoses</a>, and the under-25s experience the highest rates of STIs overall. In 2008, the UN reported that globally only 40% of young people aged 15-24 had accurate knowledge about HIV and transmission, while the same group accounted for 45% of all new HIV infections. SRE also presents an opportunity to undermine the stigma faced by people living with HIV through education about transmission without moral judgement. (Stats from <a href="http://unesdoc.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=183281&amp;set=4A5EF7B6_3_66&amp;gp=1&amp;lin=1&amp;ll=1">here</a>.)</p>
<p>This is important, big picture, long term stuff. It’s very hard to unlearn attitudes and prejudices formed in your early life, and not everyone has an <a href="http://www.usborne.com/catalogue/catalogue.aspx?area=S&amp;subcat=SFL&amp;id=62"><strong>Usborne Guide To Growing Up</strong></a> at hand (even that magnificent volume had its blind spots – Miranda reminded me of the ‘kthanxbai!’ box-out on homosexuality…<sup><a href="/2011/11/30/whos-afraid-of-sex-education/#footnote_1_8719" id="identifier_1_8719" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" Ed butting in again: has this been expanded yet?

Here’s a linklist &#8211; go show them some well-informed, safe and respectful love.</p>

<h3>Pr0n</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ll get my position down as briefly as I can here so I can get on with the post. I wouldn’t say I’m &#8216;pro-porn&#8217; because I&#8217;m dead against the unsafe and exploitative (like many industries, it must be said) mainstream porn industry. I find a lot of it distressing and unpleasant to watch. But I don&#8217;t accept the argument that violent porn has any causal link to violence against women beyond the fact that it re-inscribes the values already at large in our society. Symptom not cause, I‘d say.</p>
<p>I have no problem with porn in theory. But mainstream heterosexual porn and all its cliches has become so dominant and so widely accepted that it has become the &#8216;norm&#8217; against which the bodies, fantasies and sexual experiences of real people are judged. We need positive, progressive sex education and much greater diversity, acceptance and openness about sex and representations of sex.</p>
<h3>Back to Celluloid</h3>
<p>Anyway. Here&#8217;s a brief synopsis I pinched from this <a href="http://www.comicsalliance.com/2011/05/26/celluloid-sex-voyeurism-dave-mckean-preview/">Comics Alliance review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Celluloid is the story of a woman who, during a moment of sexual frustration, discovers a film projector and reel of film that depicts a couple having sex… this woman finds herself traveling from our world into a dreamlike realm of sexual fantasies that&#8217;s presented in the artist&#8217;s trademarked style(s)&#8230;. The woman begins simply as a voyeur and eventually graduates to full participant in various activities with the entities she encounters.</p></blockquote>
<p>And here’s a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fantagraphics/sets/72157626623303707/show/">Flickr slideshow</a> of images from the book so you can see what they’re talking about. It’s terribly beautiful, which to be honest I have come to expect from McKean. But the whole thing left me with a sadly unsexy feeling of ‘meh’.</p>
<h3>Tickle my Intellect</h3>
<p>Of course, reviewing an erotic work is tricky because what flicks your switches is such a personal matter, but even setting that aside I found I was disappointed. It didn’t turn me on. But it didn’t interest me either. In this <a href="http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=32469">Comic Book Resources interview</a>, McKean outlines some of his aims behind the project:</p>
<blockquote><p>Most pornography is pretty awful. I mean, it does the job at the most utilitarian level, but it rarely excites other areas of the mind, or the eye. It&#8217;s repetitive, bland and often a bit silly. I was interested in trying to do something that… tickles the intellect as well as the more basic areas of the mind.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yay for intellect-tickling! That sounds right up my street. But I don’t think <strong>Celluloid</strong> delivered. I realise now that what I was hoping for was something that felt as different to mainstream porn as <a title="Black Orchid" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/05/24/black-orchid-ecofeminism-and-the-feminine-superheroic/"><strong>Black Orchid</strong></a> was from most 1980s superhero comics. And of course it <em>is</em> different on its shimmering surface, but the fantastic situations and sensual artwork are resting on some conventions from mainstream pornography that hold no allure for me.</p>
<p>For example: the female protagonist is inevitably thin, white, and able-bodied, with long blonde hair. She&#8217;s apparently bi-curious heterosexual. After having a bath in her empty house, she decides to put her high heels back on. The situation that frames her sexual journey is that she comes home and calls her boyfriend/husband/playmate, but he’s still at the office, so she’s stuck with a pout, a bath and some self-pleasure. I was half expecting her to order a pizza and get it on with the delivery man. One reviewer, who I won’t grace with a link, even described her as a ‘bored housewife’. It just feels so clichéd, and for me that undermines the eroticism of the art and the originality of the project.</p>
<h3>Boobfruit</h3>
<p>Visually the weakest section (in my opinion) is what I’m going to call the Boobfruit section, in which the protagonist:</p>
<blockquote><p>…encounters an “earth mother” figure, haloed in fruit and with fourteen breasts… as the woman consummates her meeting with the goddess, the resultant imagery throws some interesting analogies between fruit and the body.</p></blockquote>

<p>I don’t know what <a href="http://www.graphic-e-y-e.com/2011/07/review-celluloid-by-dave-mckean-and.html">Graphic Eye</a> find so interesting about the analogies between fruit and the body. Fruit as a symbol of sex and fertility, and particularly cis female reproductive organs, is pretty much as old as art. Here’s some extremely luscious fruit conveniently dropped into a painting of a youthful <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Elizabeth_I_Steven_Van_Der_Meulen.jpg">Elizabeth I</a>, painted at a time when her fertility was a subject of international political speculation. And what could Frida Kahlo possibly be referencing <a href="http://www.fridakahlofans.com/c0402x.html">here</a>? You get the picture.</p>
<p>There’s also a cliché-within-a-cliché of fruit being used as a sensual reference point in descriptions of lesbian sex. I just couldn’t take this episode seriously, especially as the fruit pictures look like they’ve been cut out of an M&amp;S advert.</p>
<h3>Subject or object?</h3>
<p>In the Comic Book Resources interview, McKean says:</p>
<blockquote><p>I also thought it would be more interesting coming from a woman&#8217;s perspective, and for it to be essentially fantastical, a series of sex dreams, allowing for a more impressionistic view, trying to express the feelings of each stage, rather than just showing you literally what happens…</p></blockquote>

<p>But although the story ‘stars’ a woman, it’s not really told from her perspective. I mean, you follow her on her surrealist sex adventures, but at no point do you get any real idea of her feelings or thoughts. She is stereotypically passive; she wanders into situations and things happen to her, and she embraces them, but doesn’t act or take the initiative.</p>
<p>Although the woman begins as an observer and becomes a participant, it’s just a trade of one kind of objecthood for another, we have no sense of her interior life, to the extent that I find it a bit creepy. She is even drawn in a remarkably dead-eyed, expressionless way.</p>
<p>I still admire Dave McKean as an artist and illustrator, and I don&#8217;t intend this review as an attack on him; he seems like a thoroughly nice bloke. I understand that he didn’t produce <strong>Celluloid</strong> with me in mind as his target audience, and perhaps he never intended to challenge all (or any) of the conventions of mainstream porn. But I wish he had, since for me that would have turned a mildly interesting and attractive book into something extraordinary.</p>

<p>Ahem. <em>Yes </em>is the last of our Old English words. It&#8217;s <em>gise </em>or <em>gese, </em>meaning &#8216;so be it&#8217;, perhaps from <em>gea, ge </em>(= &#8216;so&#8217;), plus <em>si</em> (=&#8217;be it!&#8217;), the third person imperative of <em>beon</em> (= &#8216;to be&#8217;). In this form, <em>yes</em> was stronger than its Germanic cognate, <em>yea </em>(much like today) and, apparently, was often used in Shakespeare as an answer to negative questions. We could do with one of them nowadays, no? How many times have you answered a question with <em>yes </em>when you mean <em>no</em>? (&#8216;Doesn&#8217;t she&#8230;.?&#8217; &#8216;&#8230;Yes, she doesn&#8217;t&#8217;).</p>
<p>The penultimate word in our Alphabet, <em>yes </em>is frequently one of the first words we learn on earth; its meaning is clear and unequivocal, by turns disastrous, passionate, exhilarating, loaded and humdrum &#8211; but always positive in the full sense of that word. It is almost invariably repeated, as in Joyce (and Usher) &#8211; &#8216;yes I will, Yes&#8217;, the successive affirmations underlining and confirming the first &#8211; just like a <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=W7eLlRE-5OwC&amp;pg=PA253&amp;lpg=PA253&amp;dq=ulysses+gramophone+hear+say+yes+in+joyce&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OCKYHR7yyY&amp;sig=Y5Za4Hwk3Sfp2sFGKGxS0xR5Nfw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=9MbzTNvyEOCAhAfmrJCLDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=ulysses%20gramophone%20hear%20say%20yes%20in%20joyce&amp;f=false">signature</a> under your printed name, if you listen to Derrida</p>
<h3>Sure &#8216;Nuff n&#8217; Yes I Do</h3>
<p>James &#8216;<a href="http://www.bedeutung.co.uk/theblog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/james_joyce.jpg">Awesome Glasses</a>&#8216; Joyce apparently made much of his novel &#8216;novel&#8217; <strong>Ulysses</strong> ending on this, which he considered &#8216;the female word&#8217;. The final chapter, &#8216;Penelope&#8217;, often also referred to as &#8216;Molly Bloom&#8217;s soliloquy&#8217;, is 42 pages of just eight sentences, wherein Molly, wife of Leopold Bloom, muses to herself in bed.</p>
<p>For those who have better things to do than wrestle with a modernist doorstop, as the wife of the novel&#8217;s &#8216;Ulysses&#8217;, Molly is a counterpart to &#8216;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penelope">Penelope</a>&#8216;, wife of Odysseus / Ulysses and conventional model of <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/03/28/an-alphabet-of-feminism-23-w-is-for-widow/">marital fidelity</a>. The similarity expires fairly quickly, since Joyce&#8217;s Penelope is having an affair with &#8216;Blazes Boylan&#8217;, but nonetheless her chapter is often named after Ulysses&#8217; wife. It begins and ends with this <em>yes</em>, and in a letter to Frank Budgen, Joyce explained that &#8216;Penelope&#8217; rotates around what he considered the four cardinal points of the female  body &#8211; &#8216;breasts, arse, womb and cunt&#8217; &#8211; expressed respectively by the words <em>because, bottom, woman</em> and <em>yes</em>. Some of the comparisons are clear – the <em><a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/03/14/an-alphabet-of-feminism-21-u-is-for-uterus/">womb</a></em> has long been seen as synonymous with &#8216;woman&#8217; (however reductively); <em>bottom / arse –</em> ok; <em>because / breasts&#8230; </em>um?; <em>yes / cunt – </em>hmm.</p>
<p>I suspect this last pairing has a lot to do with the affirmation of sex: interaction with this organ <strong>should</strong> be one preceded by <em>yes </em>and punctuated with repetitions of this confirmation (<em>yes yes yes</em>). (Why James Joyce, you filthy&#8230;). We see a similar thing in Usher (first time for everything): the repeated <em>yeah, yeah, yeah </em>is a sexual affirmation – &#8216;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiXbRBS5Z58">How the hell am I supposed to leave??</a>&#8216;. This is about a female seduction (&#8216;she&#8217;s saying &#8220;come get me&#8221;!&#8217;), but one that we suspect will not end in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCss0kZXeyE">when-i&#8217;m-sixty-four</a> style knitting by the fire. For one thing, we learn that Usher already has a &#8216;<a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/11/15/an-alphabet-of-femininism-7-g-is-for-girl/">girl</a>&#8216;, who happens to be &#8216;the best of homies&#8217; with this club seductress; for another, Ludacris announces they will leave after a couple of drinks because they &#8216;want a <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/12/20/an-alphabet-of-femininism-12-l-is-for-lady/">lady</a> in the street but a freak in the bed&#8217;. So actually, the art of being a <em>lady </em>lies in effectively concealing a consent that, in private, becomes loud, repeated and unstoppable.</p>
<h3>Yes Indeed</h3>

The 'Easy Girlfriend' Poster, 1943-4</p></div>
<p>This is a well-trodden path, and all part of the old idea of how consent given too easily (<em>yes yes yes</em>) – or, in some cases, even given at all – is liable to get females into trouble. A less well-trodden example is Richardson&#8217;s <strong>Sir Charles Grandison </strong>(1753), which devotes several hundred of its thousand or so pages to what happens after the protagonist has proposed to his fiance: though she has accepted the proposal, she fears that to &#8216;name the day&#8217; herself – or even to consent to a &#8216;day&#8217; suggested to her – would be to show a forwardness disturbing in a woman. Disturbing perhaps, but probably a relief to the exhausted reader, for she manages to suspend her final consent to &#8216;thursday a month hence&#8217; for an entire blushing, confused volume of this hefty tome.</p>
<p>We can go further back, of course: in Shakespeare-times, Juliet fears Romeo will think she is &#8216;too quickly won&#8217;. To correct this, she offers to &#8216;frown, and be perverse, and say thee <em>nay</em>&#8216; (<em>no no yes</em>), artificially constructing a well-won consent where positive affirmation already exists (history does not record whether or not Juliet was &#8216;a freak in the bed&#8217;). Many would-be Romeos have seized on such fears to assume (or convince themselves) that this is just what their ladies are doing when they give an unequivocal &#8216;no&#8217;, so seduction narratives are littered with lovers assuming their lovers really mean <em>yes </em>when they reply in the negative<em> – </em>examples have spanned Austen&#8217;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWx7AF8B0R8&amp;feature=related">Mr Collins</a> to modern day Mills &amp; Boon. Apparently, in the latter case, one is supposed to find this irresistible.</p>
<h3>Go No More A-Roving</h3>
<p>We&#8217;re teetering around something rather insidious here, and one aspect of this finds its expression in a 1940s propaganda poster. The &#8216;Easy Girlfriend&#8217; anti-VD advert placed the blame for the Second World War venereal epidemic squarely with the momento-mori type be-hatted skull (a sexually experienced re-appropriation of the medieval <a href="http://www.abcgallery.com/B/baldung/baldung16.JPG">Death and the Maiden</a> trope). &#8216;The &#8220;easy&#8221; girlfriend spreads syphilis and gonorrhea&#8217;, it blazed – she who says <em>yes </em>too easily is to be shunned by polite society, and will be – <em>naturellement </em>– riddled with disease. Of course, syphilis&#8217; original spread throughout Europe had followed the path of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Tour">Grand Tour</a>, but this must have been because Venetian prostitutes were taking expensive package holidays throughout France, Spain, Rome, Switzerland and Turkey, mustn&#8217;t it, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Byron">Lord Byron</a>?</p>
<p>So while you probably disagree with Joyce&#8217;s view that <em>yes </em>is an intrinsically female word, it&#8217;s certainly one whose utterance is littered with potential problems for women. <em>Yes </em>means <em>yes. </em></p>

					<description><![CDATA[If you live in Britain, you'll have noticed that you've had a census posted to you.  For the census to merely ask the (binary) "sex" of the British people is to erase the identities of the numerous trans* and Intersex Brits.   What the fuck are we meant to put?   Do we tick both?

Based on  the fact that we have <em>this</em> many of <em>these</em> people, we&#8217;ll spend our money <em>this</em> way.&#8221;</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s actually quite important that the data gathered is accurate.</p>
<p>Imagine my disgust, then, when I turned to page whatever-it-is where it asked me:</p>
<p><strong>What is your sex?</strong><br />
<strong>[ ] Male  [ ] Female</strong></p>
<p>You read that right.   There&#8217;s <em>just</em> the box to state your &#8220;sex&#8221;, and there&#8217;s only two boxes, and there&#8217;s no mention whatsoever of gender anywhere.</p>
<p>Now, anyone capable of thought will realise that <strong>sex is distinct and non-prescriptive of gender, and gender is not binary. </strong> Indeed, <strong>neither are binary</strong>.  For the census to merely ask the (binary) &#8220;sex&#8221; of the British people is to  erase the identities of the numerous trans* and Intersex Brits.   What  the fuck are we meant to put?   Do we tick both?   Do we add another box?    Do we just shun the whole thing altogether?   If there&#8217;s a define-own  space for religion, why not for gender?</p>
<p>How are we ever meant to  glean accurate data on how many trans* and Intersex people we have  living here in the British Isles if there&#8217;s no room for them on the  bloody census?!</p>
<p>Therefore, I have the following favour to ask of you: <strong>if  you are living in Britain, have access to a telephone and some excess  bile going, give the census <a href="http://2011.census.gov.uk/index.php?content_id=135">helpline</a> a call and complain.</strong> If no-one  speaks up about this, they will never know.   And if we can&#8217;t fix 2011&#8217;s  census, it may well be fixed next time from our shouting this time  around.</p>
<p><strong>Edited to add: </strong>I&#8217;ve been informed that there&#8217;s a Facebook event to pass around <a href="http://www.facebook.com/#!/event.php?eid=130571420348024">right here</a>, if you&#8217;re Facebookly-inclined, and a friend of mine, who has actually bled some sense from the person they were on the phone to, has reported that they really don&#8217;t know how to handle this, and that <strong>if you tick both &#8220;male&#8221; and &#8220;female&#8221;, you CANNOT be fined for not providing information</strong>, although you may get a phone call to check the data and see how it can be incorporated.  Result!  For best results, though, combine both &#8211; tick both boxes <em>and</em> call them to vent your spleen.  The T is not silent, people.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">OVARY</h2>
<h3>Oh! Darling.</h3>
<p><em>Ovary</em> hopped onto the semantic stage around 1658 meaning &#8216;the female organ of reproduction in animals, in which <em>ova </em>or eggs are produced&#8217; (<em>ova </em>being the Latin plural form of <em>ovum </em>= egg). Eggs, of course, are now generally recognised as a crucial part of reproduction in all species (a chicken ovulates every day, fact fans), making the <em>ovary </em>rather important for the construction of little&#8217;uns. Straightforwardly, the word derives from <em>ovarium: </em>&#8216;ovum&#8217; + &#8216;-arium&#8217; (aquarium, oceanarium, planetarium, toastarium). Consistency: it&#8217;s helpful. But hold! 1658? Really? What about before? Was there some mass genital evolution in the late seventeenth century that made early modern cisgendered Woman so drastically different from her medieval sisters?</p>

<p>Well no, but there was an evolution in what Scientists considered &#8220;Woman&#8221; to be. For hundreds of thousands of years previous, the established thinking had been that they were simply men &#8216;turned outside-in&#8217;: female genitals were held &#8216;up there&#8217; by a colder body temperature than their male counterparts, and, thus, sex differences were a matter of degree. Women were men who hadn&#8217;t quite unfurled properly.</p>
<h3>Oh My God</h3>
<p>With this thinking, the <em>vagina</em> became an inverted penis, the <em>labia</em> a foreskin, the <em>uterus </em>a scrotum, and the <em>ovaries</em> testicles – and all these now-familiar gynecological terms date from the same period: the <span style="color: #000000;">oft-maligned</span> <em>vagina</em> (= &#8216;sheath&#8217;) is faux-Latin from 1680,<em> labia</em> (= &#8216;lip&#8217;) slightly earlier (1630s) and <em>uterus</em> the earliest, from 1610 (although, <span style="color: #000000;"><a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/11/22/an-alphabet-of-femininism-8-h-is-for-hysteria/">as already mentioned in these pixellated pages</a></span>, it was conflated with the gender-neutral &#8216;womb&#8217; or &#8216;belly&#8217;, its original Latinate meaning). Pre-seventeenth century <em>ovaries </em>were consequently referred to as &#8216;female testicles&#8217; or &#8216;stones&#8217;, and the synonymity was so literal as to accept the possibility that if a girl got too hot through strenuous exercise, her entire reproductive system could <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XR2BcRwiG-sC&amp;pg=PA127&amp;lpg=PA127&amp;dq=marie+germain+montaigne&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wUFyuQjNb2&amp;sig=ljtQ1Xb5-TMH8RfJfyae_XtbgGg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=plY8TYLHBpGYhQeqjJGxCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=marie%20germain%20montaigne&amp;f=false">accidentally pop out and turn her into a boy</a>.</p>
<p>So if sex was a false distinction to make, how did male and female manage to breed? Seventeenth-century scientists approached this question firstly through <a href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/aris-bio/">Aristotle</a> and his theory of epigenesis (= &#8216;origin through growth&#8217;). Aristotle reckoned male semen gave the embryo its form, and female menstrual blood supplied the raw materials.<sup><a href="/2011/01/24/an-alphabet-of-femininism-15-o-is-for-ovary/#footnote_0_1950" id="identifier_0_1950" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" Yes, menstrual blood. ">1</a></sup> The &#8216;soul&#8217; enters the embryo at the moment the mother first feels the baby kick.</p>
<p>However, by suggesting new people can spring into being organically, epigenesis risks dispensing with divine involvement. Not cool. So a much <span style="font-size: 13.2px;">more palatable alternative, for seventeenth-century scientists, was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spermist_theory">preformation</a> (the idea that the parents&#8217; seed already contained a miniature adult, so <a href="http://www.hps.cam.ac.uk/visibleembryos/s1_4.html">all the embryo has to do is increase in size</a>). Bit creepy, right? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaas_Hartsoeker">Nicolaas Hartsoeker</a> (1656-1725) was well into this idea and even claimed he could see these &#8216;homunculi&#8217; through the microscope (above, right).</span></p>
<p>But once this had been agreed, there came the inevitable Swiftian debate about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilliput_and_Blefuscu">how you like your eggs</a>, with scientists divided into &#8216;aminalculists&#8217; and &#8216;ovists&#8217;: those who were with Hartsoeker in believing the &#8216;germ&#8217; of life to be in the sperm, and those who preferred the &#8216;egg&#8217; (= &#8216;the female&#8217;). Arguing in favour of the latter was the (understandable) confusion about why God would be so wasteful as to create thousands of Hartsoekerean sperm-germs to be lost on every egg-ward excursion for the sake of one single fertilization: from the outside, the female looked a bit more efficient.</p>
<p><strong>Oh! You Pretty Things</strong></p>
<p>But clearly, all this Knowledge was better on the subject of males than females (and even the women themselves were hard pressed to explain menstruation or recognise pregnancy): <span style="font-size: 13.2px;"><em>ova </em>were still shrouded in mystery, and <em>ovulation </em>a great unknown – it was not even certain whether human females could conceive without orgasm, or if they were more like cats, rabbits, llamas (now known as &#8216;induced ovulators&#8217;) and, er, men. Official advice erred on the side of caution and recommended that both man and wife reach orgasm during procreation – as a side-effect, a rapist could get off scott-free if his victim fell pregnant, since, until the nineteenth century, the law worked backwards and considered conception to imply enjoyment and, therefore, consent.</span></p>
<p>It is William Harvey (1578-1657), most famous for &#8216;discovering&#8217; the circulation of the blood, who is commonly credited with realising the importance of an <em>ovary</em>-thing, and the frontispiece to his treatise on the subject blazons th<span style="font-size: 13.2px;">e tag &#8216;<em>ex ovo omnia</em>&#8216; (&#8216;everything from the egg&#8217;). But he was thinking less of a modern day &#8216;<a href="http://www.theodora.com/anatomy/the_ovum.html">egg cell</a>&#8216; and more of a &#8216;spirit&#8217;: an <em>egg</em> was the mother&#8217;s &#8216;idea&#8217; of a fetus which was &#8216;ignited&#8217; in her womb during sex. It was a general generative catalyst, not technical anatomy – as is clear from the image (below, left).</span></p>

<h3><strong>Oh My Gosh</strong></h3>
<p>After kicking around for just over a century, <em>ovary</em> suddenly became enshrined in anatomy books as an independent organ that somehow encapsulated &#8216;woman&#8217;: in 1844 Achille Chereau declared that &#8216;it is only because of the ovary that woman is what she is&#8217; (oh dear). In part, this was to do with a retreat from the previous centuries&#8217; idea that women and men were anatomically the same and an advance towards the notion that sex equalled gender (a surprisingly modern invention, if you listen to <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Making-Sex-Gender-Greeks-Freud/dp/0674543556/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1294676447&amp;sr=8-1">Thomas Laqueur</a>). With this came an increasing focus on specifically &#8216;women&#8217;s&#8217; problems via <em>hysteria </em>(= <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/11/22/an-alphabet-of-femininism-8-h-is-for-hysteria/">&#8216;womb trouble&#8217;</a>), and, neatly (if disturbingly) a favourite cure for this pre-Freud was the <em>bilateral ovariotomy</em>, also dubbed &#8216;female castration&#8217;: removing a patient&#8217;s healthy <em>ovaries </em>to man them up a bit (just as men become &#8216;feminized&#8217; through removal of the testicles). The <em>ovariotomy </em>would thus, it was believed, act not just as a cure for hysteria, but also for behavioural pathologies including nymphomania, and even general aches and pains. Of course, it also stopped menstruation, rendered women infertile and carried risks endemic to c19th surgery methods. WE DON&#8217;T KNOW WHAT THIS DOES, SO LET&#8217;S JUST TAKE IT OUT.</p>
<p>It was not until the 1930s that scientists got near a hormonal understanding of <em>ovulation</em>, how it worked and how it could be controlled. Here we really should give a nod to that symbol of 1960s sexual liberation: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_oral_contraceptive_pill">combined oral contraceptive pill</a>, a great source of division between parents and children, as epitomised in the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/dec/13/people-inspired-pop-songs-muses">backstory</a> to the seminal Beatles song <strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lG3nXyI41M">She&#8217;s Leaving Home</a> </strong>(1967). See, children of the 1920s and 30s must have found the idea of their daughters silently and imperceptibly controlling their <em>ovulation</em> terrifying, whereas the children of the 1960s saw such control as simple empowerment. In miniature, this gives us the whole history of <em>ovary </em>and its linguistic cognates: what cannot be seen is inevitably free for appropriation by a host of meanings. Meaningarium.</p>
