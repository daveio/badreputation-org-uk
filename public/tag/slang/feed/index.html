					<description><![CDATA[Ah, summer holidays. With the annual Revelation Of The Flesh comes a more recent addition to the pile of what Caitlin Moran might term ABSOLUTE BULLSHIT.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ah, summer holidays. Bringing with them the many body-related tribulations of trying to get on in life in the face of ridiculous social conventions on how you should look (yes, thank you very much <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/07/19/found-feminism-how-i-stopped-worrying-and-learned-to-say-no-to-the-special-k-lady/">Special K Lady</a> and your Cohorts of Doom). With the annual Revelation Of The Flesh comes a more recent addition to the pile of what Caitlin Moran might term ABSOLUTE BULLSHIT.</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/IGP5030.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="6958" data-permalink="/2011/08/22/holiday-notes-the-tramp-stamp/_igp5030/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/IGP5030.jpg?fit=800%2C534&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="800,534" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;4.5&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;PENTAX *ist DL&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1175623811&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;38&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;200&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.016666666666667&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="butterflytattoo" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/IGP5030.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/IGP5030.jpg?fit=800%2C534&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/IGP5030-300x200.jpg?resize=300%2C200" alt="Photo of a caucasian person's lower back tattooed with a purple butterfly surrounded by black tribal-style pattern markings.

<p>The puerile association between a woman&#8217;s choice of tattoo placement and her sexual availability. AKA the <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=tramp+stamp">Tramp Stamp</a>. I hate that word. I hate it as a woman who has many tattoos and is bored rigid of all the shitty comments from the Morally Uptight Brigade about how ink looks &#8220;common&#8221; or &#8220;trashy&#8221; on women (and it&#8217;s almost always about women), how I&#8217;ll hate it when I get older, which is another dull reminder of how once we&#8217;ve lost our looks we&#8217;re for the bonfire of other people&#8217;s vanities.</p>
<p>But worse is the fact that tattoos, <a href="http://tattoo.about.com/od/tattoosgeneralinfo/a/tramp_stamp.htm">particularly this placement</a>, have been added to the ever mounting list of Reasons Why Women Are Sluts. <a href="http://slutmeansspeakup.org.uk/">We marched for this, people</a>!</p>
<p>A quick scroll around the internet reveals the extent of the problem. Over 2 million results on Google for the term &#8220;tramp stamp&#8221; alone. Top hit is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_back_tattoo">the Wikipedia article</a> which doesn&#8217;t even try to assert any form of anti-sexism editing beyond the coy reference to &#8220;lower back tattoo&#8221;, which I initially applauded until I saw the bare bottom shots used in the article. There are pages and pages devoted to <a href="http://www.heavy.com/comedy/2010/02/the-20-worst-tramp-stamps/">deriding these tattoos</a>, and the <a href="http://trampstampnation.net/girls-with-tramp-stamps/">women who have them</a>. So far, so bad.</p>
<p>The litmus test is whether the chaps get tarred with the same brush. Seems not. They may well have tattoos in this place (it&#8217;s a good bit of skin to get inked) but they&#8217;re apparently doing it for the<a href="http://typophile.com/node/52779"> irony factor</a>. Or, poor thing, <a href="http://culturegarage.com/article/bmw_driver_does_pain_killers_booze_and_ends_up_with_tramp_stamp/">by accident</a>.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I&#8217;m not denying that some of these tattoos are ugly, silly or plain ridiculous. I&#8217;m very fussy about my tattoos and I love each one to bits almost as much as I love <a href="http://ugliesttattoos.failblog.org/">bitching about crap ones</a>. Tattoos are a matter of personal taste, not a flag declaring whether or not I want to sleep with you: if you pour scorn and sexist drivel on my ink, then I definitely don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Tramp stamp &#8211; another phrase that we can probably do without. Agreed?</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Queen is one of the few Alphabet words with a firmly British origin, but it makes up for its lack of Latinate pedigree by being extremely complicated. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6 style="text-align: center;">Q</h6>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">QUEEN</h2>
<blockquote><p>To sour your happiness, I must report<br />
The queen is dead.</p>
<p>Shakespeare, <strong>Cymbeline </strong>(1611) V.5.3400</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Queen </em>is one of the few Alphabet words with a firmly British<em> </em>origin, but it makes up for its lack of Latinate pedigree by being extremely complicated. So this is the part where the rap breaks down &#8211; it comes from the Old English <em>cwen</em>, the proto-Germanic <em>kwoeniz</em>, and (follow it back far enough) the proto-Indo-European <em>gwen</em> (= &#8216;woman, wife&#8217;). Proto-awesome, man. In this form it coincides rather nicely with the Greek <em>gyne</em>, meaning &#8216;woman, wife&#8217; (thus <em>gynecology</em>, <em>misoGYNy</em>, <em>gynophobia</em>, and indeed <em>gynocentric</em>), and a whole host of other languages that I don&#8217;t think we need all up in our grill just now.</p>
<h3>My Family and Other Animals</h3>
<p>The interesting thing about these origins is their relation to another word: <em>quean</em>, originally a variant form of <em>queen</em>, meaning then &#8216;woman, female&#8217; but now mostly an &#8216;effeminate homosexual man&#8217; (cf., er, <em>queen</em>). Its etymology is similar, but with more emphasis on the insults: thus, <em>quean</em>&#8216;s forebears include the Middle Dutch <em>quene </em>(= &#8216;older woman&#8217;), the Dutch <em>kween </em>(= &#8216;hussy&#8217;) and the Middle Low German <em>quene </em>(= &#8216;woman, wife, old woman&#8217;). It eventually gives us &#8216;a promiscuous woman&#8217; sometime around the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>As is often the case, plenty of forebears inevitably only leads to plenty of embarrassing cousins, and many of these roots (<em>cwen </em>and the Greek <em>gyne </em>in particular) have also been claimed as parents to <em>cunt</em> ( =  &#8216;the vulva or vagina&#8217;), spelled <em>quaint </em>and sometimes <em>queynt </em>by Chaucer, just to illustrate the fluidity of &#8216;cw&#8217;, &#8216;qu&#8217; and &#8216;cu&#8217;. When you know that <em>portcwene </em>( = literally &#8216;a public woman&#8217;) means &#8216;prostitute&#8217;, the association of <em>quean / quean </em>and <em>cunt </em>may perhaps become somewhat clearer: it&#8217;s what you might call <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synecdoche">synecdoche</a>. This may also throw some light on <em>quean/queen</em>&#8216;s gay associations: inevitably, words that suggest penetration of the female (<em><a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/01/31/an-alphabet-of-femininism-16-p-is-for-pussy/">pussy</a>, bitch</em>) are eventually seized upon to denigrate an &#8216;effeminate&#8217; man. <em>Queen </em>as &#8216;a flamboyant homosexual&#8217; is from the 1920s (as is <em>queer</em>, which originally means &#8216;oblique, off centre&#8217;), thus coinciding with a modicum more gay visibility than its sixteenth century usage.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 13px;"> </span></p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not all doom, gloom and back to the Unmentionables: let&#8217;s talk thrones. English is unusual in giving a <em>queen </em>her own word, and not simply feminizing <em>king </em>(= &#8216;of noble birth&#8217;) &#8211; compare the French <em>roi </em>and <em>reine</em>, from the Latin <em>rex </em>and <em>regina. </em>Nonetheless, the first definition of a <em>queen </em>in the dictionary is as &#8216;a king&#8217;s wife or consort; a lady who is wife to a king&#8217; but the second sense, as &#8216;a woman who is the chief ruler of a state, having the same rank and position as a king&#8217;, is Old English itself, so the two definitions are likely to be essentially simultaneous.</p>
<h3>The English the English the English are best.</h3>
<p>Yes, over here on Albion&#8217;s chalk-ringed shores, we&#8217;ve had no less than seven reigning <em>queens</em>. By contrast, even pre-1789, the hated French would never let Ringo have a go &#8211; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salic_law">lol Salic law</a> – and all their famous female royals were lowly consorts (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_of_Valois">Margaret de Valois</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_de'_Medici">Catherine de Medici</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Antoinette">Marie Antoinette</a>&#8230;), although <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_IV_of_France">Henri IV</a> was several degrees more awesome than any English king, ever. <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_RMP5gGGaNA0/SdS53BcjXSI/AAAAAAAAC6g/hH7lkbHAZhw/s320/henry-iv.jpg">Look at how pleased with himself he is</a>! But I digress.</p>
<p>However positive the existence of historical female monarchs on this <a href="http://www.quotes.net/quote/5427">royal throne of kings, this sceptr&#8217;d isle</a>, the residual physicality of <em>queen </em>in relation to <em>cunt </em>is still lurking around, and the body of the <em>queen </em>has always carried a significance that goes beyond everyday concerns about legitimacy (although those are there too). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_of_Aragon">Catherine of Aragon</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_of_Cleves">Anne of Cleves</a>, queens to Henry VIII, were both publicly subjected to a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/oct/30/catherine-aragon-giles-tremlett-review">series of intimate questions</a> (and threatened physical examination) about their wedding-bed virginity, genital health and sexual history, and that&#8217;s before you get into discussions down the pub throughout history about When The King Is A Queen (thus <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_II_of_England#Edward_and_Piers_Gaveston">Edward II</a> roundly condemned for A Weak King and put to an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_II_of_England#Death">&#8216;ironic&#8217; death</a>), and the reigning <em>queen</em>&#8216;s menstrual cycle and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_of_Modena#Queen_.281685.E2.80.931689.29">likelihood of producing a royal heir</a>.</p>
<p>This last was an issue that clearly dogged even those English queens ruling in their own right: in 1554, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_I_of_England">Mary I</a> was declared to be with child, triggering thanksgiving services and country-wide celebration, until over a year later her belly decreased in size and the &#8216;pregnancy&#8217; was revealed to be a humiliating &#8216;phantom&#8217; (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_pregnancy">pseudocyesis</a>), caused by her intense desire for an heir. After a second false pregnancy two years later, she died (possibly from a uterine tumour) in 1558.</p>

<p>A couple of hundred years later, amid some of the most spectacular changes in British history, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_II_of_England">Mary &#8216;Williamanmary&#8217; II</a> and her<em> </em>sister, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne,_Queen_of_Great_Britain">Anne</a>, were competing to be the first to bear a child, and, in consequence, were rarely on speaking terms. Mary had an early miscarriage which may have permanently impaired her ability to have a baby, while Anne (despite being fairly definitely gay herself) had six children who died, eight still-births and four miscarriages. Meanwhile, a few Georges and a William later, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Victoria">Victoria</a>&#8216;s famous fruitfulness was widely seen as a positive statement about British greatness in an imperial age: the truly maternal monarch, whose offspring gave England royal relations in Hesse, Prussia (though post-1914 we didn&#8217;t talk about that), and Russia (oops).</p>
<h3>Queen Of My Heart.</h3>
<p>But, of course, we (along with everyone else, ho ho) have not touched on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_I_of_England">Elizabeth I</a>, the &#8216;Virgin Queen&#8217;, Gloriana, etc who managed to make a virtue of childlessness by representing the immaculate body of the queen as the symbol of a healthy nation. Bang on cue, <em>queen</em>&#8216;s third meaning is &#8216;a female whose rank or pre-eminence is comparable to that of a queen; applied, for example, to the Virgin Mary, to the goddesses of ancient religions or mythologies, or to a woman as a term of endearment or honour&#8217;. This is the sense it has in <strong>Twelfth Night </strong>when Viola is &#8216;Orsino&#8217;s mistress and his fancy&#8217;s <em>queen</em>&#8216;, in which context it has something of <em><a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/12/20/an-alphabet-of-femininism-12-l-is-for-lady/">lady</a> </em>about it, just ramped up to full throttle: someone who is also the &#8216;chief  ruler of a state&#8217; is indeed a mistress <em>par excellence.</em></p>
<p>It was this tradition that Elizabeth milked till it had no more to give, presenting herself as the adored <em>lady </em>at the centre of a courtly cult of virginity, an age which produced Edmund Spenser&#8217;s <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Faerie_Queene">The Faerie Queene</a></strong> and Walter Raleigh&#8217;s <strong><a href="http://www.luminarium.org/renlit/oceanintro.htm">The Ocean To Cynthia</a></strong>, as well as hundreds of portraits depicting Queen Elizabeth<em> </em>as immaculate goddess and virgin. Her fleshlessness was only exacerbated after 1592, when the elderly<em> queen</em> stopped sitting for portraits at all, forcing artists to work from earlier templates of her face, creating an eternal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portraiture_of_Elizabeth_I_of_England#The_last_sitting_and_the_Mask_of_Youth">&#8216;Mask of Youth&#8217;</a>.</p>
<p>So <em>queen </em>is a word that fuses sexuality and a microscopic focus on the body (where more so than in its use to attack people for what they like to do in the bedroom?) with a kind of awestruck &#8216;Glorianian&#8217; respect. Those who sit on this lexical pedestal are perhaps a little wonky: it is unfortunate that <em>queenly</em> success seems attainable only for those rulers who have produced litters of miniature monarchs and the one who maintained a virginal ice-princess sort of deal. But then, looking back over England&#8217;s history (and, of course, its present), it is cheering to see that Women Have At Least Done It. Now if we could just fix that male primogeniture business&#8230;</p>

<p>It should take no great mind to figure out that there is a relationship between <em>pussy </em>and <em>puss</em>, right? The second is, as with so many -y words, a diminutive form of the first.</p>
<p>Etymologically, <em>puss</em> comes from a family of Germanic words, including the Dutch &#8216;<em>poes&#8217; </em>(= &#8216;cat&#8217;, or &#8216;a large soft mass&#8217;), and this is one of those words that has had a telling journey from its initial meaning to its modern significance. In simple form, of course, it just means &#8216;cat&#8217;, with a tendency towards the proper name, as in <em>Puss In Boots. </em>The dictionary refines this to a &#8216;call-name&#8217; or &#8216;nursery term&#8217; for a cat, perhaps originating in the sort of &#8216;tsk tsk tsk&#8217; noises even the most Serious People inevitably make when seduced by the classic paws, ears and whiskers combo (&#8216;Here puss puss!&#8217;).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Around the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, <em>pussy </em>hit its most common modern usage as &#8216;the female genitals&#8217; (&#8216;the vulva or vagina&#8217;, specifically), with an attendant list of seductive compounds and phrases: <em>eat pussy</em>, <em>pussy posse</em>, <em>pussy patrol</em>, <em>pussylicker&#8230; &amp;</em>c. For the moment, though, eyes on the road: <em>pussy&#8217;s </em>earliest non-feline meaning was &#8216;a girl or woman exhibiting characteristics associated with a cat, especially sweetness or amiability&#8217; (1580s), where it could also be used as a term of endearment (<em>pussycat.</em> Oh, Mr Jones, really&#8230;).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is, natch, a colloquial usage, as is its subsidiary meaning under this banner, &#8216;a sweet or effeminate man&#8217;. Only later does this degenerate into the unarguably opprobrious, as &#8216;a weakling, a coward, a sissy&#8217;, in which sense citations tend to link it to the idea of &#8216;a domesticated man&#8217;, akin to a &#8216;house-cat&#8217; (of which more presently). Of course, suggestions about sexuality are never far away from such mockery, and a <em>pussy </em>could, from its earliest beginnings, refer also to &#8216;a male homosexual&#8217; (where it sits in parallel to <em>pussy</em>&#8216;s final meaning as &#8216;the anus or mouth of a man as an object of sexual penetration&#8217;, connecting it to &#8216;weakling&#8217; through the concomitant feminisation such penetration implies).</p>
<h3>Perfect As Cats</h3>

<p>But to really answer the question of when and why cats became synonymous with all this, we must, as usual, ask another question: when and why did cats enter our everyday lives in the first place? It happened late: like so many modern phenomena, cats-as-companions were an eighteenth-century innovation. They had been knocking around before, of course, but primarily as pest control; those showing undue affection for their felines were considered, at best, as a bit eccentric, and, at worst, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37_-WajfHW0&amp;feature=related">in league with Satan, and the pagan forces of Nature</a>. Dogs had had a bit more success elbowing their way into domesticity, due to their usefulness in hunting and their essential biddability, but even for them, the eighteenth century was a golden time.</p>
<p>See, it&#8217;s easy to forget the fear and awe this Nature lark could inspire in the centuries before efficient systems to keep it under &#8216;control&#8217;, and as the European traveller elbowed his way into Asian and American forests at the dawn of the Enlightenment, he must have felt he was asserting mastery over the very earth (along with the pesky native peoples already living there, of course). With confidence comes bravado, and this increasing satisfaction with Man&#8217;s superiority over the elements quickly sparked a fashion for adopting domestic creatures. And so it was that throughout the eighteenth century, cats were welcomed into the home partially as symbols of conquest (where they were painted, along with those Definite Symbols of Conquest, <a href="http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l18ei9aOF91qa4s0qo1_500.jpg">monkeys</a>, <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/'Young_Woman_with_a_Parrot',_pastel_drawing_attributed_to_Lorenzo_Tiepolo,_1762,_El_Paso_Museum_of_Art.jpg">parrots</a> and exotically dressed <a href="http://www.history.org/history/teaching/enewsletter/volume4/images/ladies3.jpg">African slave boys</a>).</p>
<p>Inevitably, anything to do with the domestic sphere comes under the auspices of the woman, and the pet-keeping craze was almost universally spoken of as a female-driven trend (although cats were also the favoured companions of weirdo intellectual types like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodge_(cat)">Samuel Johnson</a>, <a href="http://42opus.com/v4n2/mycatjeoffry">Christopher Smart</a> and <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Ode_on_the_Death_of_a_Favourite_Cat,_Drowned_in_a_Tub_of_Gold_Fishes">Horace Walpole</a>): while the men were out brokering deals down the coffee-house, their wives lounged around in their hoop skirts with an army of diverting creatures to keep them from <em>complete</em> mind-numbing boredom. Of course, fail to go down the coffee-house as a Man, and you risk mockery as a &#8216;pussy&#8217; in the literal sense of &#8216;the creature that stays at home with the woman&#8217;, viz., a house husband.</p>
<h3>Kitten As A Cat</p>

Where&#39;s the cat? &#39;Le Lever de Fanchon&#39;, c18th.</p></div></h3>
<p>So we have here a consortium of pets, creatures the woman owns, something special to her, a possession and constant companion – and it is easy to see the short step from the woman&#8217;s private domestic world to <em>pussy</em> in its Naughty Connotation (spot the cat! spot the cat! <em>passim</em>). So the coincident lexical trend that ended in <em>pussy </em>as genitals must have begun with something along the lines of the now-common association of pet and owner – not a surprising association, since <em>pussy</em>&#8216;s cousin, <em>moggy</em> originally meant just plain old &#8216;woman or girl&#8217;, and didn&#8217;t acquire its feline associations until the early twentieth century.</p>
<p>And these associations were standard: we only have to look at the <a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3033/3016798779_8a03c26509.jpg">legion </a>eighteenth-century portrait <a href="http://www.atticpaper.com/prodimages/mousegirl.jpg">variants</a> on the theme of a<a href="http://alliswatsonancestors.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/joseph-collyer-the-younger4.jpg?w=578&amp;h=792"> girl holding a kitten </a>to see a perceived resemblance extending even to the facial: something about the cat made it a perfect image of womanhood. Its furriness could hardly have been irrelevant (nudge nudge), but the cat&#8217;s synonymity with the female must have had a lot to do with felines&#8217; status as a convenient symbol of beauty and cruelty, known to play with their prey before killing it. Thus, little girls looking at Joshua Reynolds&#8217; <a href="http://alliswatsonancestors.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/joseph-collyer-the-younger4.jpg?w=578&amp;h=792">contribution</a> to the girl/kitten portrait were instructed by an accompanying Moral Poem to look at &#8216;this thy furry care&#8217; and see &#8216;an emblem of thyself&#8217;, since, once grown, both girl and kitten will find delight in torturing, respectively, &#8216;some trembling MOUSE&#8217; and &#8216;some sighing SWAIN&#8217;.</p>
<h3>We&#8217;re gift-wrapped kitty-cats&#8230;</h3>
<p>The sexual symbolism a cat could suggest also found expression in a series of male-dominated complaints about something slightly more insidious: the familiarities their would-be lovers allowed their pets – from monkeys sharing their mistress&#8217; beds upwards.  And, unsurprisingly, there was a particularly misogynistic strain of such writing aimed at the &#8216;old maid&#8217;, who had replaced the never-appeared fiancé and family with a veritable menagerie of domestic animals (an idea that endures to this day, for who else is the &#8216;crazy cat lady&#8217;?), with an inevitable imputation in many cases that there was some kind of sexual element to the displacement, however repressed it might be.</p>
<p>It is perhaps unsurprising, then, to find that <em>pussy</em> eventually resolves itself into a final definition as &#8216;a woman, or women collectively, regarded as a source of sexual intercourse&#8217; (thus <em>pussy patrol</em>), and, in specifically prison-based slang, as &#8216;a man or boy regarded in this way&#8217; (cf. <em>bitch</em>). Curious that feline and canine should find themselves so aligned&#8230;</p>
