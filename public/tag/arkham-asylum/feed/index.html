					<description><![CDATA[I have decided to ape some of the monthly features of gaming print mags and introduce a “What I’ve been playing…” summary post. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have decided to ape some of the monthly features of gaming print mags and introduce a “What I’ve been playing…” summary post.  Sometimes I can play very few games and other times I can get through quite a bit; more to the point, there&#8217;s always something to say but often it might not be strictly in the feminist vein, or there might not be <em>enough</em> to develop into a full article.  So this post will be a bit of a test run – I know we’re in February now but I’m looking back at the completed month of Jan here – let’s see how we go, shall we?</p>
<h3>Batman: Arkham City</h3>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/ac.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="9753" data-permalink="/2012/02/13/gamer-diary-what-ive-been-playing-january-2012/ac/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/ac.jpg?fit=303%2C167&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="303,167" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Batman: Arkham City" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/ac.jpg?fit=300%2C165&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/ac.jpg?fit=303%2C167&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9753" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/ac-300x165.jpg?resize=300%2C165" alt="Batman logo with the words &quot;Arkham City&quot; in red beneath - on a white background." width="300" height="165" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/ac.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/ac.jpg?w=303&amp;ssl=1 303w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>There were ‘issues’ with <strong><a title="Wikipedia - Arkham City" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkham_City" target="_blank">Arkham City</a></strong> (as you can read in my <a title="[Gamer Diary] Batman: Arkham Asylum &amp; Arkham City, or; The Bat and his Bitches" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/01/30/gamer-diary-batman-arkham-asylum-arkham-city-or-the-bat-and-his-bitches/">previous article</a>), but there were still some good things to say as well.  The styling and the graphics were great (as they were in <strong><a title="Wikipedia - Arkham Asylum" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_Arkham_Asylum" target="_blank">Asylum</a></strong>), and I enjoyed the noir feel that they went for, although it didn’t feel as gritty as the first game.  I suspect that may be because once you’ve seen something for the first time it loses its special impact.</p>
<p><strong>City</strong> felt a bit <em>too</em> big coming after <strong>Asylum</strong> without the storyline longevity to really back it up.  There&#8217;re a lot of side quests and other bits to do and investigate, so the game has expanded in width as opposed to length.  Personally, I tend to let the side quests fall by the wayside as I power through the story.  It was a fairly competent and engaging(ish) story until the ending (I won’t spoiler but it sucked) despite the near ‘<em>deus ex machina</em>’ way in which they ended the stories of four key characters.</p>
<p>Playing as Catwoman was novel to begin with, but in the end wasn’t a big enough plus as one might have hoped.  Adding to the boiling pot were even more gadgets and even more complicated combat moves that you had to remember in order to beat certain baddies.  Overall, I think they over-complicated a sound concept that could’ve done a lot better.  If you played the first game and are thinking about getting <strong>City</strong>, wait until it comes down in price first or until they release a copy with the DLCs included.</p>
<h3>Assassin’s Creed II</h3>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/250px-Assassins_Creed_2_Box_Art.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="9754" data-permalink="/2012/02/13/gamer-diary-what-ive-been-playing-january-2012/250px-assassins_creed_2_box_art/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/250px-Assassins_Creed_2_Box_Art.jpg?fit=250%2C354&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="250,354" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Assassin&#8217;s Creed II box art" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/250px-Assassins_Creed_2_Box_Art.jpg?fit=211%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/250px-Assassins_Creed_2_Box_Art.jpg?fit=250%2C354&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-9754 alignright" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/250px-Assassins_Creed_2_Box_Art-211x300.jpg?resize=148%2C210" alt="The image feature a man in hooded robes facing forward with two blades coming from contraptions on his wrists. The title reads &quot;Assasin's Creed II&quot; above him." width="148" height="210" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/250px-Assassins_Creed_2_Box_Art.jpg?w=211&amp;ssl=1 211w, https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/250px-Assassins_Creed_2_Box_Art.jpg?w=250&amp;ssl=1 250w" sizes="(max-width: 148px) 100vw, 148px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>This may seem an odd choice considering <a title="Wikipedia - Assassin's Creed Revelations" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin%27s_Creed:_Revelations" target="_blank"><strong>Revelations</strong> </a>came out at the end of last year, but I played <a title="Wikipedia - Assassin's Creed Brotherhood" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin%27s_Creed:_Brotherhood" target="_blank"><strong>Brotherhood</strong> </a>before <a title="Wikipedia - Assassin's Creed II" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin%27s_Creed_II" target="_blank"><strong>AC2</strong> </a>so I had a whole 22 years of story to catch up on before I went on to the newest instalment.  This is another game series I was late getting into, as evidenced by me <em>still</em> not having completed the first game(s), but I enjoy it nonetheless.</p>
<p>The graphics and world design are always fantastic with these games; they build entire cities before your eyes.  The characters are ones that you can invest in; ‘sandboxing’ can be just as fun as the main story; the controls aren&#8217;t always the easiest (on PC) but you can get there in the end.  This game is super fun, and now I&#8217;m clued in on <a title="Wikipedia - Ezio Auditore da Firenze" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezio_Auditore_da_Firenze#Ezio_Auditore_da_Firenze" target="_blank">Ezio’s </a>pre-Brotherhood story I can look forward to <strong>Revelations</strong>.  My only quibble is that there are only so many times I can listen to passers-by shouting <em>“He’ll break something, the idiot!”</em> (or any of their repetitive comments) before I&#8217;ll consider risking desynchronisation just to kill a few civvies.</p>
<h3>Machinarium</h3>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Machinarium-titulka.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="9755" data-permalink="/2012/02/13/gamer-diary-what-ive-been-playing-january-2012/machinarium-titulka/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Machinarium-titulka.jpg?fit=411%2C554&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="411,554" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Machinarium" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Machinarium-titulka.jpg?fit=222%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Machinarium-titulka.jpg?fit=411%2C554&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright  wp-image-9755" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Machinarium-titulka-222x300.jpg?resize=178%2C240" alt="The picture sees a towering city in the background with two main figures in the foreground climbing over a mound of discarded rubbish. Two small robots and a robotic bird are making their way across the scenery and two other robots look on from further away." width="178" height="240" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Machinarium-titulka.jpg?w=222&amp;ssl=1 222w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Machinarium-titulka.jpg?w=411&amp;ssl=1 411w" sizes="(max-width: 178px) 100vw, 178px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>A cute little indie puzzle game, <a title="Wikipedia - Machinarium" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machinarium" target="_blank"><strong>Machinarium</strong> </a>was a little bit of a distraction in between Arkham and AC2 to cleanse the palette of my brain, as it were.  It’s a clever little offering set in a robot city, in which you have to stop some bad robots from killing the King robot and free your girlfriend from the evilbots’ grasps.  Various puzzles and stages lead you all over the city until you finally save the day.  Artistically it’s simple but charming and my only issue was the overused-in-indie trope of saving a damsel in distress.</p>
<h3>Other gaming from January 2012</h3>
<p>Those three are, admittedly, the only three games I have completed, but I&#8217;ve been dipping in and out of others too! <a title="Wikipedia - Serious Sam 3" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serious_Sam_3" target="_blank"><strong>Serious Sam 3: Before First Encounter</strong></a> has so far been good nostalgia-laden fun, but my brain really has been in Open World mode recently and my FPS-ing has suffered as a result. <a title="Wikipedia - Sonic Generations" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_Generations" target="_blank"> <strong>Sonic Generations</strong></a> on PC has also been providing me with some chilled gaming – apart from when I get stuck – as it is bright, colourful and cheery, even in the face of a big baddie who is destroying time.  Finally, not one <em>I</em> have been playing, but <a title="Wikipedia - Skate (video game)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skate_(video_game)" target="_blank"><strong>Skate</strong> </a>on Xbox 360 has been my favourite Let’s-Watch-Someone-Else game as I curl up on the sofa and watch my partner switch nollie heel something-or-other around San Vanelona – it is a good game, but the controls can be a bit pesky for a PC purist, and the complete and total absence of <em>any</em> female boarders is a bit dull.</p>
<h3>Plans for February</h3>
<p>So far, I don’t have any hard-and-fast plans on games; I <em>might </em>revisit <strong>Brotherhood</strong> as I enjoyed AC2 so much (and I lost my <strong>Broho</strong> save game).  I may also stretch to buying <strong>Revelations</strong> as I would like to make sure March is clear for <a title="Youtube - Mass Effect 3 trailer" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENehG1njkEo" target="_blank"><strong>Mass Effect 3</strong></a>.</p>
<p>What has everyone else been playing so far in 2012?</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Now you can play as Catwoman too!  However, she appears to have fallen foul of Rule 1 of Sensible Female Armour.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As is my tendency, this is <a title="[Gamer Diary] RPG Advertising: Where Did All The Women Go?" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/05/16/gamer-diary-rpg-advertising-women/">another party I was late to</a>.  I only got <strong>Arkham Asylum</strong> in late October last year as a gift in a <a title="Steam" href="http://store.steampowered.com" target="_blank">Steam</a> sale – it was only a fiver – and I had previously been rather sceptical about it.  Nevertheless, I played through it and found it very refreshing as a game – very noir, good combat, puzzles to solve and places to explore – and the storyline was interesting, as was the inclusion of so many Batman baddies.  Basically, in short, I loved it.</p>
<p>Mostly.</p>
<p><a title="Batman Wiki: Harley Quinn" href="http://batman.wikia.com/wiki/Harley_Quinn_(Batman:_Arkham_Asylum)" target="_blank">Harley Quinn</a> and <a title="Batman Wiki: Poison Ivy" href="http://batman.wikia.com/wiki/Poison_Ivy_(Batman:_Arkham_Asylum)" target="_blank">Poison Ivy</a> were the issues.  I don’t want to sound like a broken record but boobs on display in a high risk profession such as being a Gotham City criminal is not exactly clever – is it?  Harley was very nice to see as a significant part of the story that is out to scupper your plans, but her being called some less-than-charming things by the Joker’s own thugs was tedious to say the least, and when you actually fight Harley <em>herself</em> she is defeated ridiculously easily &#8211; in a cutscene no less.  Disappointing.</p>

It&#8217;d be terribly inconvenient and I might have to reconsider my outfit!&#8221;</p></div>
<p>Ivy, when you first meet her, is lounging about in her cell – apparently the only female inmate – not wearing prison issues but her own clothes displaying her sizeable bust.  Later, in her boss fight, for some reason she decides to float about attacking you in what &#8211; as our ed described to me in an email &#8211; “appears to be a giant laughing vulva-plant which flaps open periodically to reveal she still isn&#8217;t wearing a great deal…”.  <strong>Super</strong>.</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure she gets referred to as some less-than-charming things too by hench<strong>men</strong>.</p>
<p>Fast forward to <strong>Arkham City</strong>, which I got in another sale (but it still cost me £20), and now you can play as <a title="Batman Wiki: Catwoman" href="http://batman.wikia.com/wiki/Catwoman_(Batman:_Arkham_City)">Catwoman</a> too!  <em>However,</em> she appears to have fallen foul of <a title="[Gamer Diary] – Dystopian Beauties: How the Apocalypse Killed all the Trolls" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/11/23/gamer-diary-dystopian-beauties-how-the-apocalypse-killed-all-the-trolls/" target="_blank">Rule 1 of Sensible Female Armour</a>: her suit is only ever zipped up to just below her breasts, allowing for ample cleavage.  When you fight thugs as Catwoman, you get called a ‘bitch’ but for some reason, if you’re Batman, you don’t get called a prick, a wanker, a bastard or even a knobend.  <em>Really</em>, people?</p>
<p>The assassins of Rā&#8217;s al Ghūl’s order are all for some reason scantily clad sex icons – as is his <a title="Batman Wiki: Talia al Ghul" href="http://batman.wikia.com/wiki/Talia_al_Ghul_(Batman:_Arkham_City)" target="_blank">daughter</a> – and the <a title="DeviantART: Arkham City Assassin Concept Art" href="http://makiog.deviantart.com/art/Arkham-City-Assasin-Concept-Art-277619351" target="_blank">concept art</a> is mainly essentially the sort of softcore you might find in lads’ mags.  In fact the vast majority of the concept art involving any female character is pretty oversexualised and repugnant.  We get to meet Ivy again, too, but it seems she still hasn’t bothered to find any clothes since the laughing vulva-plant incident.  And Harley is wearing even more revealing kit than last time.</p>

<p>Now, even if we leave aside all of this sexist nonsense, <strong>Arkham City</strong> is somewhat disappointing anyway.  I finished the storyline in less than a day; the ending snuck up on me and was rubbish.  I won’t say what happens, but&#8230; just&#8230; what?!  That’s even before I get to the complaint I have with the <em>huge</em> continuity hole left at the end.  I was so disheartened by it that I did a Ragequit of Disappoints and haven’t gone back on it since.  Even though I still have lots of side quests and puzzles to solve, I just haven’t found the heart to go back to it.</p>
<p><strong>Arkham Asylum</strong> was worth the £5 but <strong>City</strong> was definitely not worth the £20 – let alone the standard retail price in the range of up to £39.99!  The first game offered something new and interesting with a gorgeous noir feel much akin to Nolan’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_in_film#Christopher_Nolan_trilogy">reimagining</a> of Gotham on film, if not grittier.  The second game whizzed past all too quickly, with no real indication that one should slow down, do side quests, do the puzzles and so on, lest you face the atrocious storyline ending.</p>
<p>Benefits of the second game, however, do exist; the world is larger, you get more gadgets and there are no area transitions between outdoor locations.  Plus you <em>do</em> get to play as Catwoman, even if she is just eye candy to be abused by burly henchmen. <em>(Are there really no female crims in Gotham?)</em></p>
<p>Both games do fall down woefully at the Treating Female Characters with Respect hurdle.  Would it truly be so hard to think logically about the design of these people?  Does Batman walk around without his Kevlar body armour, flexing his pectorals, with a big “SHOOT HERE” target on his chest?  No.  No, he does not.  So why should Catwoman, or Ivy, or Harley?  Basic boob-sense would say maybe a comfy sports bra would be better than leather basques and flimsy shirts with only one button done up.  At least then the breast tissue wouldn’t detach during all this acrobatic criminality.</p>
<p>Also, Catwoman has anti-gravity boobs.</p>
