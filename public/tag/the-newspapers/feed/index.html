										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to X &amp; Y Communications, an agency (apparently) specialising in the impact of gender differences on business, <a title="Daily Telegraph: What Do Women Want From Cars" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/columnists/neil-lyndon/8294019/What-do-women-want-from-cars.html" target="_blank"> women ask themselves one fundamental question</a> when contemplating the  purchase of a car. Is it the price?, I hear you wonder. Is it the safety  rating, or the fuel efficiency?</p>
<p>No. It&#8217;s: <em>&#8220;Will it make me look hotter when I step out of it outside a bar or restaurant?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Yes, the main thing that will make a woman decide on a particular car is how &#8216;hot&#8217; she feels in it. <strong>Telegraph</strong><em> </em>writer  Neil Lyndon &#8211; bemoaning the fact that his wife&#8217;s friend opted  for a car she liked and he deemed useless &#8211; goes on to tell us all about the new  Citroën DS3, decorated by graphic artist <a title="Orla Kiely" href="http://www.orlakiely.com/uk/" target="_blank">Orla Kiely</a>.  Now you really will be able to match your car to your handbag. Isn&#8217;t  that snazzy, girls? All your tricksy car decisions solved by this one  simple, fashionable step!</p>

<p>According to Lyndon, his wife&#8217;s divorced friend ignored all sensible, practical considerations when making her car choice, and simply went for a pretty French hatchback. Because that&#8217;s what women do, of course: we go for the pretty option despite it possibly being on fire.</p>
<p>The thing is &#8211; and this will come as no surprise to those familiar with his prior work &#8211; Lyndon is talking complete twaddle. According to AutoEbid.com&#8217;s <a title="AutoEbid.com's Help Me Choose a New Car" href="http://www.autoebid.com/help-me-choose.asp">Help Me Choose a New Car</a> function, you can choose from six factors when trying to find the perfect car for you. They are: Comfort, Styling, Handling, Depreciation, Economy, and Safety. The price is a liming criterion: the thing that helps you to narrow your choice, rather than the main principle of selection. In fact, unless you are going into the market with an extremely limited amount of money, the cost of the car will only ever help you to select a class, or possibly a financing option. Put it another way: no one will switch from a brand-new Fiat 500 to a second-hand Volvo XC90, even though both can be had for roughly £10k.</p>
<p>So how do people choose cars, then, if it&#8217;s not the price?</p>
<p>1. First and foremost, functionality. What are you going to use the car for? If you have five children that will need running to school every morning, you will probably end up with that Volvo. If, on the other hand, you&#8217;re looking for an urban runabout, something small and easy to park is probably better.</p>
<p>2. Up there as a consideration is styling: you want it to look good. In fact, certain TV shows have gone so far as to have an entire segment over whether <a title="The Cool Wall" href="http://topgear.cloudapp.net/default.aspx">a car is &#8216;cool&#8217; or not</a>. The guide there, by the way, is whether a cool person would drive it. Perhaps X &amp; Y Communications neglected to canvas the Top Gear audience in their research.</p>
<p>3. The last, all encompassing question is: I live with it? This includes things like reliability, fuel economy, ability to park it in London, whether the suspension will destroy your spine the first time you drive over road-humps.</p>
<p>The &#8216;price&#8217; question helps to narrow your options, and, on occasion, to disabuse you of the notion that you really could afford to buy a supercar if you sell the house and both kidneys.</p>
<p>The key question Lyndon ignored was what his wife&#8217;s friend wanted in a car: she wanted a cute little urban runabout that would cheer her up in the mornings. Put simply, she wanted that &#8216;new car&#8217; feeling: you&#8217;ve chosen well, your car looks good, and you love it more than it is natural to love an inanimate object. If she was a man lovingly polishing his vintage (decrepit) Rolls, Lyndon would have smiled indulgently.</p>
<p>What Lyndon is bemoaning is not women&#8217;s tendency to pick cars that  make them look good &#8211; we all do that. No one has ever looked at a car and thought, &#8220;sure, it&#8217;s beautiful, but given the choice I&#8217;d go for the ugly, uncomfortable one on the left.&#8221;  Our budgets and priorities may vary, but the  intent remains the same. You buy the thing that makes you feel happy  when you&#8217;re inside it. Lyndon seems to have forgotten that, or have  momentarily blanked out all car adverts, ever. It&#8217;s such an established  cliché that car makers can now produce meta-tastic pastiches of previous  ads and we lap it up. Check out this Volvo V60 &#8220;How to make a sexy car  advert&#8221; clip:</p>

<p>When you sell a lifestyle, of course you&#8217;re going to sell a cool,  stylish one. Only a fool would try to market a boring car for boring  people.</p>

<p>Of course, that&#8217;s really the thing Lyndon is taking an issue with. <em>He</em> wanted his wife&#8217;s friend to go away and make a list of her  requirements, and bring back the top three cars that fulfilled them. He  would then counsel her to make the reasoned, practical decision. <em>She</em> wanted to buy a cool hatchback following a messy divorce. The thing is,  women going through messy divorces are not meant to want cool  hatchbacks. They&#8217;re not meant to want anything funky or stylish. They  should be worried about making ends meet, and where the rent is coming  from, and how they&#8217;re going to get to work now that their ex-husband has custody of the car. No divorced woman should want to look or feel  attractive, and she certainly shouldn&#8217;t be be gallivanting around bars or restaurants. I could choose this point to make a catty comment about how  Lyndon left his wife for another woman, <a title="No More Sex War" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/More-Sex-War-Neil-Lyndon/dp/0749315652/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1298924959&amp;sr=8-2">published a book </a>railing against  the &#8220;universal dominance of feminism&#8221; and has since been struggling to  rebuild his career.</p>
<p>Lyndon&#8217;s article reveals nothing about gender or, indeed, about car choice (and I highly doubt the odious Mr Lyndon chose his  own car based on a set of requirements and flowcharts). All it shows us is how deep his prejudices still lie: a woman who is hard up and urgently needs a car should not, in Lyndon&#8217;s  world, get to make that sort of choice. Having asked his advice, she  should have acknowledged his superiority and allowed him to select one  for her. After all, her preference for a &#8220;chic little French-made hatchback&#8221;  instantly indicated to him that she must not have the know-how to do it  herself.</p>
<p>And as for the Citroën DS3, the target of Lyndon&#8217;s ire: well, it&#8217;s not doing too badly, despite Lyndon&#8217;s contempt. It&#8217;s just been named <strong>Top Gear Magazine</strong>&#8216;s <a title="Top Gear Magazine 2010 Car of the Year" href="http://www.topgear.com/uk/photos/the-2010-top-gear-awards?imageNo=1">2010 Car of the Year</a>.</p>
