										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hawkeye, introduced to many by the <strong>Avengers</strong> film but a Marvel character since his first appearance in <strong>Tales of Suspense</strong> all the way back in 1964, has struck a bit of a chord on Tumblr &#8211; particularly in his incarnation as Jeremy Renner in <strong>Avengers Assemble</strong>. <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/07/09/guest-post-in-defence-of-fanfiction/" target="_blank">Shipped</a> mercilessly with the Hulk in <a href="http://tumblr.com/tagged/hulkeye">the Hulkeye fandom</a> &#8211; and <a href="http://gingerhaze.tumblr.com/post/23086933818/hulk-like-to-look-at-the-pictures">particularly adorably by Noelle ‘gingerhaze’ Stevenson</a> &#8211; not a day goes by without Hawkeye in some incarnation crossing my dash.</p>
<p>Lately, though, something has been stirring in the Tumblsphere (which is definitely a word shut up SHUT UP). Comic portrayals of female characters have been questioned, dissected, and found to be both objectification-tastic, and downright anatomically impossible.</p>
<p>Now, if there’s anything that Tumblr loves, it’s mixing up social justice with fandom.</p>
<p>Thus, <a href="http://www.thehawkeyeinitiative.com"><strong>The Hawkeye Initiative</strong></a> was born. The rules are simple: find a female character in comics being portrayed as an object and/or in a position that human anatomy would simply laugh at, then redraw Hawkeye in that pose, wearing the same outfit.</p>
<p>It is a <em>thing of beauty</em>. Let me show you what I mean. Click a thumbnail to open each image without leaving this page.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> [<a href="/2012/12/10/the-hawkeye-initiative/">See image gallery at badreputation.org.uk</a>] </p>
<p>If you’re a Tumblr user, <a href="http://www.thehawkeyeinitiative.com">The Hawkeye Initiative</a> is a Tumblr despite its domain, and can be followed like any other. If you have a sense of humour and an understanding workplace, I think it’s unlikely that you’ll regret doing so.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I've recently found myself spending some time with Mary Russell, the heroine of a series of books by Laurie R King which also feature Sherlock Holmes as her mentor, and later her husband.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While I wholeheartedly approve of <a title="Bad Reputation - In Defence of Fanfiction" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/07/09/guest-post-in-defence-of-fanfiction/">fanfiction</a>, I&#8217;ve never been a big fanfic reader. Not because of any quibbles over canon or squeamishness about interpretation, but because I&#8217;m too stubborn to spend any time in anyone else&#8217;s version of something I love. The versions I craft myself tend to stay in my head, but they entirely prevent me from enjoying myself with fanfic.</p>
<p>However, in the pursuit of pop culture adventures I&#8217;ve recently found myself spending some time with Mary Russell, the heroine of a series of books by <a href="http://www.laurierking.com/">Laurie R King</a> which also feature Sherlock Holmes as her mentor, and later her husband. Like Holmes, Russell (her preferred moniker) is intelligent, logical, brave, unconventional and excellent at fighting, with a superb aim and a talent for disguises etc etc. She is Jewish, British-American, and studies theology at Oxford. She also dresses in men&#8217;s clothes.</p>
<p>What drew me to the books was the fact that Russell is a self-described feminist. Although she mentions her political beliefs in the first book, 1994&#8217;s <a href="http://www.laurierking.com/books/mary-russell/the-beekeepers-apprentice-1994"><strong>The Beekeeper&#8217;s Apprentice</strong></a>, the second is all about feminism. Well, feminism and theology. And murder. It&#8217;s even called <a href="http://www.laurierking.com/books/mary-russell/a-monstrous-regiment-of-women-1995"><strong>A Monstrous Regiment of Women</strong></a>. I enjoyed it immensely, despite many silly moments and patchy writing. Incidentally the majority of the writing is pretty good, and I feel that the voice of Holmes rings true most of the time, which is no mean feat.</p>
<p>The author says of the series:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mary Russell is what Sherlock Holmes would look like if Holmes, the Victorian detective, were a) a woman, b) of the Twentieth century, and c) interested in theology. If the mind is like an engine, free of gender and nurture considerations, then the Russell and Holmes stories are about two people whose basic mental mechanism is identical. What they do with it, however, is where the interest lies.</p></blockquote>
<p>I find this intriguing, and I&#8217;m tempted to read the books again with that genderless mental mechanism in mind. For Holmes, the mind as an engine is his proclaimed ideal; flawless logic and cool rationality. Watson (in Conan Doyle&#8217;s <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1661/1661-h/1661-h.htm#1"><strong>A Scandal In Bohemia</strong></a>) famously describes Holmes&#8217; low opinion (and fear?) of those &#8220;softer passions&#8221; which &#8220;might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, it&#8217;s Holmes&#8217;s human deviation from this mechanical ideal that is often most interesting to readers and fans. (See also: Mr Spock.) Russell is more well-adjusted; that is to say she acknowledges her emotions, and her desire, although grudgingly. Whether this is because she is a woman, because she is a citizen of the 20thC or because we as readers have more access to her thoughts than we do Holmes&#8217;s I couldn&#8217;t say.</p>

But her masculine traits made me wonder if a feminine female Holmes is an impossibility. Would the character be in a permament spasm of contradiction or would they make a better go of reconciling femininity and reason than Holmes seems to be able to? Perhaps Conan Doyle came closer than most himself with <a title="ASH Irene Adler" href="http://www.ash-nyc.com/irene.htm" target="_blank">Irene Adler</a>, often positioned as Holmes&#8217; female counterpart. While she is formidably intelligent, she is also impulsive, emotional, and sexual.</p>
<p>The thing I found most difficult to deal with, like many readers I suspect, is their May to December romance. When they meet, he is 52. And she is 15. When they marry they are 58 and 21 respectively. And for added creepiness, after their first (awful, awful) kiss: <em>“By God,” he murmured throatily into my hair. “I&#8217;ve wanted to do that since the moment I laid eyes upon you.”</em> What is there to say except *vom*?</p>
<p>Thankfully, the first hint of anything sexual between them arrives right at the end of the second book in the series when Russell is 21. Holmes just spends most of the first novel in which she is a teenager stroking her hair in a fatherly fashion. Still, there are some unsettlingly groom-y undertones which means the novels rely very heavily on the reader&#8217;s trust in Holmes as the embodiment of honour.</p>
<p>The other bothersome thing for me is Russell&#8217;s unavoidable <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue">Mary Sue</a>-ness. As well as acting as an avatar for the author (also a Jewish, British-American, feminist theologian) she ticks lots of <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommonMarySueTraits">the boxes</a>: succeeds at everything, is effortlessly friends with everyone, has a dramatic and tragic backstory, no flaws that aren&#8217;t endearing, and so on.</p>
<p>Arguably though, as far as being a freakish overachiever goes she is no more of a Mary Sue than Holmes himself. I think there&#8217;s a lot of truth in the argument that Mary Sue and her counterpart <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartyStu">Marty Stu</a> face double standards, and that successful, powerful female characters are dismissed or undermined through accusations of being a Mary Sue. Rhiannon at <a href="http://feministfiction.com/2012/06/13/call-the-character-police-weve-got-a-mary-sue/">Feminist Fiction</a> writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;once the words “Mary Sue” have been uttered, all productive conversation is shut down. It says that the character is not worth talking about, not worth analyzing, because she’s somehow incomplete&#8230; She’s not a character but a projection of female fantasy, and therefore innately, indisputably bad. Any character who falls into this category might be somewhat one-dimensional, lacking the depth and flaws needed for a really compelling character, but the term goes beyond that, throwing on implications of worthlessness (at best) and a kind of superior disgust at girlish dreams and ambitions (at worst). Because “Mary Sue” only refers to female characters.</p></blockquote>
<p>Although I picked up the first book because of the fandom, I found myself wishing the Mary Russell books had simply been a series of novels about a feminist woman detective in the early 20thC. I think Russell would make a fine addition to the ranks occupied by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Marple">Miss Marple</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mrs_Bradley">Mrs Bradley</a>, being a little less genteel and younger, more impulsive, and more of an action detective in the manner of Holmes, employing disguises and fisticuffs as necessary. They&#8217;re good stories, and although Holmes is in the background I&#8217;m not sure he needs to be there at all.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome to the start of an all-new series on Bad Reputation, where I delve into a misunderstood, secretive, or just slightly odd subculture. Today, we’re going to start with bronies.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m hoping this&#8217;ll be the start of an all-new series on Bad Reputation, where I delve into a misunderstood, secretive, or just slightly odd subculture. Today, we’re going to start with bronies.</p>
<h2 id="originofspecies">Origin of Species</h2>
<p>Let’s start with a little background.</p>
<p>Once upon a time (1982), in a marketing meeting far, far away (Rhode Island), Hasbro decided to take on the My Little Pony intellectual property. They marketed it pretty much exclusively at girls. The toys were sold with world-shakingly innovative features such as brushable hair and a unique mark on each character’s butt.</p>
<p>The theme continued with a couple of animated series &#8211; in which the ponies partook in such riveting activities as going to school and dating &#8211; and even a feature film. This was pretty standard stuff for Hasbro, who had long since realised the value of getting kids involved with a cartoon. My Little Pony continued on form, with few variations on the core premise, until 2010.</p>
<h2 id="mylittlepony:friendshipismagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</h2>
<p>Everything changed in 2010. Lauren Faust, animator supreme, was roused from her cryogenic slumber. Her mission: to turn a tedious, gender essentialist franchise into something that would break gender boundaries and interest a whole new generation in animated ponies with magical tattoos.</p>
<p>There’s also the horse porn fanart, but we’ll get onto that later.</p>
<p>Faust lists the things that she hopes to achive with MLP:FiM in her <a href="http://msmagazine.com/blog/blog/2010/12/24/my-little-non-homophobic-non-racist-non-smart-shaming-pony-a-rebuttal">Ms. Magazine article about the issue</a>. To quote &#8211;</p>
<blockquote><p>There are lots of different ways to be a girl.</p>
<p>[&#8230;] This show is wonderfully free of “token girl” syndrome, so there is no pressure to shove all the ideals of what we want our daughters to be into one package.</p>
<p>[&#8230;] Cartoons for girls don’t have to be a puddle of smooshy, cutesy-wootsy, goody-two-shoeness. Girls like stories with real conflict; girls are smart enough to understand complex plots; girls aren’t as easily frightened as everyone seems to think. Girls are complex human beings, and they can be brave, strong, kind and independent–but they can also be uncertain, awkward, silly, arrogant or stubborn. They shouldn’t have to succumb to pressure to be perfect.</p>
<p>Yes, My Little Pony is riddled with pink, the leader is a Princess instead of a Queen and there probably aren’t enough boys around to portray a realistic society. These decisions were not entirely up to me. It has been a challenge to balance my personal ideals with my bosses’ needs for toy sales and good ratings. [&#8230;] There is also a need to incorporate fashion play into the show, but only one character is interested in it and she is not a trend follower but a designer who sells her own creations from her own store. We portray her not as a shopaholic but as an artist.</p></blockquote>
<p>Lauren Faust, I think I love you. And, apparently, I’m not the only one. MLP:FiM gained a <em>fucking enormous</em> audience, across all gender identities. For example, let’s take a look at this video.</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/zNryNfvcQlY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p> ;</p>
<p><em>Just fucking look at it.</em></p>
<h2 id="rightgoodsowhatactuallyisabrony">Right, good, so what actually IS a Brony?</h2>
<p>Wikipedia will know, right?</p>
<blockquote><p>Brony is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Krzyżanów, within Kutno County, Łódź Voivodeship, in central Poland. It lies approximately 12 kilometres (7 mi) south of Kutno and 40 km (25 mi) north of the regional capital Łódź.</p></blockquote>
<p>No, probably not. Let’s try Urban Dictionary and ignore anything referring to a sex act or requiring specialist equipment. It might take a while.</p>
<blockquote><p>A name typically given to the male viewers/fans (whether they are straight, gay, bisexual, etc.) of the My Little Pony show or franchise. They typically do not give in to the hype that males aren’t allowed to enjoy things that may be intended for females.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s better. Pretty accurate, too, though I understand that it’s not a gender-specific term (so pay attention to the word ‘typically’ there).</p>
<p>So what do bronies care about? Why are they bronies? I wouldn’t dream of putting uninformed words in their mouths. I went digging for some My Little Pony forums, and put out a little questionnaire via <a href="https://twitter.com/syn/status/215835928499994625">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/comments/vdxv4/im_writing_an_article_about_bronies_its_not_a/">Reddit’s /r/mylittlepony</a>.</p>
<p>I didn’t have much luck finding any insights on the forums, but I found this post very sweet…</p>
<p align="center"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/brony-seeking-question.png"><img loading="lazy" style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="brony-seeking-question" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/brony-seeking-question_thumb.png?resize=590%2C182" alt="brony-seeking-question: screenshot of a forum post asking: have you ever been out in public and found out someone's a brony? did you talk to them about the show? if not, would you like to?'" width="590" height="182" border="0" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>…and this reply absolutely hilarious when taken out of context…</p>
<p align="center"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/brony-seeking-reply.png"><img loading="lazy" style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="brony-seeking-reply" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/brony-seeking-reply_thumb.png?resize=414%2C73" alt="Screenshot reading 'I have seen on many occasions strangers with pony gear on.'" width="414" height="73" border="0" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>…but I digress. I digress pervily, but it’s definitely digression. Let’s move on to the questionnaire.</p>
<h2 id="thebroniesspeak">The Bronies Speak</h2>
<h3 id="whatisyourgenderidentity">“What is your gender identity?”</h3>
<p align="center"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/gender.png"><img loading="lazy" style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="gender" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/gender_thumb.png?resize=365%2C260" alt="bar chart showing gender of respondents: men are in the lead." width="365" height="260" border="0" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>I discovered after putting the questionnaire online that some female MLP fans call themselves “pegasisters”, so there’s potential selection bias in the results. Still, it validates what I was hoping for &#8211; that the majority of responses were coming from the male-identified side of the fandom.<sup><a href="/2012/08/08/adventures-in-subcultures-the-bronies/#footnote_0_11390" id="identifier_0_11390" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" Ed&rsquo;s tiny note: I&rsquo;m wondering how our trans* readers may feel about the way we&rsquo;ve differentiated our categories here. On reflection, it might have been more inclusive to label the &ldquo;male&rdquo; and &ldquo;female&rdquo; categories &ldquo;cis&rdquo;. We did want to avoid any implication that someone who is trans* cannot simply have access to the general terms of &ldquo;male&rdquo; or &ldquo;female&rdquo; &ndash; this is not a view we hold! &ndash; but we may not have succeeded, and it&rsquo;s just as arguable here that we&rsquo;ve done the opposite. Similarly, the question of whether to involve more or fewer &lsquo;categories&rsquo; took some ruminating, and Dave took a while crowdsourcing views on this. In any case, I thought I&rsquo;d say we&rsquo;re always happy to receive feedback for future surveys. ">1</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="wereyouafanofthemylittleponyfranchisebeforefriendshipismagicstarted">“Were you a fan of the My Little Pony franchise before Friendship is Magic started?”</h3>
<p align="center"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/fanbefore.png"><img loading="lazy" style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="fanbefore" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/fanbefore_thumb.png?resize=365%2C170" alt="pie chart with a majority of No answers" width="365" height="170" border="0" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>The community seems to be nearly exclusively focused on the new iteration of My Little Pony, without any pre-existing interest in the older material.</p>
<h3 id="wouldyoubehappyformostorallofthepeopleyouknowtoknowthatyouidentifyasabrony">“Would you be happy for most or all of the people you know to know that you identify as a brony?”</h3>

<p>The number of positive responses to this surprised me. MLP fans get a hard time online, and it can only be worse in meatspace. Perhaps the show’s message of love and tolerance results in a more optimistic viewpoint, or attracts those already predisposed to one.</p>
<h3 id="whatappealstoyouabouttheshowitself">“What appeals to you about the show itself?”</h3>
<blockquote><p>I thoroughly enjoy the idea that a show can be feminine, and ‘made for girls’, without being an overblown, over-prissy tea party. The deconstruction of gender binary and gender stereotypes present in the show is admirable and wonderful.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– anon</em></p>
<blockquote><p>It is refreshing to see a show, even amongst children’s programming, that is completely lacking in cynicism. The show and the characters within it are un-selfconciously idealistic and positive. It provides fantastic role models for children of all genders, and the world it has built feels rich and fully occupied.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– Tim (@trivia_lad)</em></p>
<blockquote><p>The entire show just feels right. When I’m watching MLP:FiM, it’s like I’m a kid again and I can enjoy the childishness of the entire thing without care.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– Shawn X (@shawnyall)</em></p>
<blockquote><p>The character diversity (for once in a children’s show, the fashionable one isn’t the bad guy) and I’m a sucker for the innocent humour included. The characters also have tragic (in the classical sense of the word) flaws: the representative of loyalty is self-centered, the representative of generosity manipulative, and when the representative of Kindness gets mad, even the Hulk would tell her to calm down.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– anon</em></p>
<h3 id="whatdoyoudislikeorresentabouttheshowitself">“What do you dislike or resent about the show itself?”</h3>
<p>The vast majority of responses to this question were “nothing, nada, zero”. It seems the community is generally very happy with the show.</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s a shame Faust had to leave, season 2 was a very different show compared to the first and even though it’s still good something felt like it was missing. I attribute that to Faust’s absence.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– Bret (@the_red_bobcat)</em></p>
<blockquote><p>Although strong, not-even-slightly sexualised female role models are a wonderful thing, I am not wholly comfortable with the representation of male characters in the show. With only one or two exceptions, male ponies are represented as stupid, or comic foils, with roles that tend to be service occupations. Unless an episode requires a stallion MacGuffin (See: a Canterlot Wedding, where you get a male character of high social status, though he is very easily manipulated by a strong, evil female character).</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– MiaVee (@MiaVee)</em></p>
<h3 id="whatareyouparticularlyproudofaboutthebronycommunitywhatdoyouenjoyaboutbeingpartofit">“What are you particularly proud of about the brony community? What do you enjoy about being part of it?”</h3>
<blockquote><p>I’m proud of what we do. We start charities, we raise money, we’re so united and loving. Really, I enjoy the love in the brony community. Everyone is just so understanding, caring, and enjoyable. When I first started watching and putting myself into the community, I didn’t know what to expect. But as I opened up more and more, they accepted me without question. They gave my life an entire new part to enjoy, and changed me forever.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– Shawn X (@shawnyall)</em></p>
<blockquote><p>I particularly enjoy the community’s openness towards almost every type of person (at least this is true for the Reddit section).</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– anon</em></p>
<blockquote><p>I am proud of the grown men who are not ashamed of watching a girls’ show just because it is for girls. I like the “love and tolerate” message and the lack of outright trolls.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– Meghan E</em></p>
<blockquote><p>I think one of the strongest indications of how the brony community aren’t all creepy, socially inept, hygiene-incapable, sexual predators is the eagerness of the producers and actors on the show to engage with them. The Hub ident produced to promote the second series, a reskin of Katy Perry’s “California Girls” called “Equestria Girls” gives a shout out to bronies, Tara Strong on Twitter actively engages with bronies (as does Andrea Libman, to a smaller extent).</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– MiaVee (@MiaVee)</em></p>
<h3 id="whatnegativeexperienceshaveyouhadorknownaboutinthebronycommunitywhatwouldyouchangeifyoucould">“What negative experiences have you had or known about in the brony community? What would you change if you could?”</h3>
<blockquote><p>The only real negative experience that I’ve known about is the discrimination against a sub-section of bronies called ‘cloppers’ &#8211; people who fantasize/look at lewd pictures of characters from the show. The cloppers themselves don’t bother me &#8211; it’s the fact that most of the fandom acts like it’s this skeleton in the closet and are extremely ashamed of it, when really it’s not a big deal.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– Rpspartin (@rpspartin)</em></p>
<blockquote><p><em></em>Anything involving shipping. No no no no no just stop. The show is cute and fine without shoehorning madeup lesbian relationships.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– anon</em></p>
<blockquote><p>The only bad times I’ve seen are all the haters that continue to try to bully us. But I wouldn’t change anything. Some of these people just need a friend and we’re more than happy to be that.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– no name provided</em></p>
<blockquote><p>Having people approach you and say “My Little Pony? Are you an 8 year old girl?” is part of being a brony, but you can live with it because once you tell them to watch the show it’s an amazing feeling to have that same person come back to you and say “Yeah, sorry bro. That show is amazing!”. Anything that’s rock and roll enough for Andrew W.K. (who’s hosting a “What Would Pinkie Pie Do?” talk) is rock and roll enough for me!</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– Bret (@the_red_bobcat)</em></p>
<blockquote><p>There is still a lot of misogyny and ableism. Many bronies seem to think that because it’s good, it can’t possibly be for girls, and thus deny that it’s a girls’ show. Alternatively, many get offended when it’s called a girls’ show because they still equate “girly” with ’bad.“ I’d rather seem them embracing the girliness of it, and responding ”yes, it’s for girls, because girls are awesome. Everything for girls should be this awesome.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– Meghan E.</em></p>
<blockquote><p>I’m reluctant to use the term “brony” to describe myself because in every corner of the internet are snarky non-fans seeking to smear every adult fan of the show [&#8230;] as a fandom overall it seems a lot more welcoming, gentle and understanding than the elitist bullcrap you can get around diehard fangirls and boys for any other show/game/movie.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– MiaVee (@MiaVee)</em></p>
<h3 id="freetexttimetellmewhateveryouthinkthatishouldknow.triviagossipyounameit.thisisyourmoment.">“Free text time! Tell me whatever you think that I should know. Trivia, gossip, you name it. This is your moment.”</h3>
<blockquote><p>The brony community is huge, and rapidly growing. Like any other community of fans, it is impossible to define the composition, interests, and behavior of its members succinctly. I’d ask, gently, that you please keep this in mind while writing your article.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– anon</em></p>
<blockquote><p>I became a slightly more positive and confident person by watching the show.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– anon</em></p>
<blockquote><p>All ponies are equal, but some ponies are more equal than others, including Rarity exclusively.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– DocTavia</em></p>
<blockquote><p>Rarity is best pony. Anyone who says otherwise is just jealous they aren’t as fabulous</p></blockquote>
<p><em>– anon</em></p>
<blockquote><p>The only thing I request is that it be made known that Rarity is easily my favourite.</p></blockquote>

<h2 id="whatdidwelearn">&#8220;The Derpy Controversy&#8221;</h2>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/derpy.png"><img loading="lazy" style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: right; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="derpy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/derpy_thumb.png?resize=260%2C199" alt="derpy" width="260" height="199" align="right" border="0" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Derpy Hooves is what&#8217;s called a &#8216;background pony&#8217;. She appeared in the crowd in one of the early episodes, and her unusual eyes earned her an instant cult following in the MLP fandom.</p>
<p>Ever attentive to their fans, Lauren Faust and the rest of the team decided to put Derpy in more prominent positions, and even give her a few lines.</p>
<p>This prompted a few equality-minded fans to complain &#8211; &#8216;derpy&#8217; being a <a href="http://genderbitch.tumblr.com/post/1005199855/conclusions-the-word-derp-and-variations">reference</a> to presentations of learning disability. From One Survivor To Another <a href="http://fromonesurvivortoanother.tumblr.com/post/15821397354/trigger-warning-ableism-ableist-slurs-an-open">wrote an open letter to Lauren Faust</a> on the issue, and <a href="http://fromonesurvivortoanother.tumblr.com/post/16423096962/tw-ableism-rape-culture-common-arguments-on-the">followed up with a smackdown</a> to many of the privilege-tastic counter-arguments that were made.</p>
<p>A modified version of the episode featuring Derpy was released on iTunes with &#8216;fixed&#8217; eyes; however, the original version was contained in the DVD release.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to get into the rights and wrongs of this one here &#8211; you can <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/derpy-hooves">read more about Derpy Hooves&#8217; history on Know Your Meme</a> if you like &#8211; but my point is simply that there was discourse in the fandom on the matter. There were strong feelings on both sides, but it&#8217;s nice to know that at least the argument could be conducted (mostly) reasonably.</p>
<h2>What did we learn?</h2>
<p>What, other than the fact that anyone who has expressed a preference wanted to be very vocal about their love for Rarity?</p>
<p>Well, it seems that the MLP fandom are <em>extremely</em> accepting. “Love and tolerance” &#8211; a term so popular that I presume it’s from the show &#8211; is paramount. We’ve seen this before, in communities like furries and otherkin. Don’t get me wrong &#8211; it’s an admirable trait &#8211; but it does lend itself to being accepting of the extremes of the community without significantly challenging them. Deserving or undeserving, that’s something that can get a community a bad name in general.</p>
<p>There is an undeniable degree of childish naïveté in the community. Potentially expected due to the nature of the show, it does seem to result in marginalising those who ‘clop’ or enjoy fanart/fanfic of the characters in adult situations. Controversial one, this, and this is only a personal view &#8211; but I see it as slightly odd but harmless. The fanart and fanfic are drawn and written, and so they don’t harm any real person. If someone wants to pat their flanks to imaginary ponies in compromising scenarios, it doesn’t harm anyone else.</p>
<p>The community seems to revel in the fact that the production team for the show is interested in what they care about, and are willing to name or give cameos to formerly nameless ‘background ponies’ that gain popularity with their fandom.</p>
<p>Bronies &#8211; and the ‘pegasisters’ that I’m sorry to have neglected in the survey &#8211; seem to be, on the whole, genuinely lovely people that just so happen to like cartoon ponies. Is their fandom a bit strange? Sure. That said, though, how many fandoms aren’t?</p>
<p>And now, if you don’t mind, I’m going to watch the first few episodes of the first season. It might be terrible &#8211; it might be great. What I’m fairly certain of, though, is that it’s not going to piss me off.</p>
<ol class="footnotes"><li id="footnote_0_11390" class="footnote"> Ed&#8217;s tiny note: I&#8217;m wondering how our trans* readers may feel about the way we&#8217;ve differentiated our categories here. On reflection, it might have been more inclusive to label the &#8220;male&#8221; and &#8220;female&#8221; categories &#8220;cis&#8221;. We did want to avoid any implication that someone who is trans* cannot simply have access to the general terms of &#8220;male&#8221; or &#8220;female&#8221; &#8211; this is not a view we hold! &#8211; but we may not have succeeded, and it&#8217;s just as arguable here that we&#8217;ve done the opposite. Similarly, the question of whether to involve more or fewer &#8216;categories&#8217; took some ruminating, and Dave took a while crowdsourcing views on this. In any case, I thought I&#8217;d say we&#8217;re always happy to receive feedback for future surveys. </li></ol>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[The fandom community is the most genre-savvy, theory-aware, innovative group of people I’ve ever had the pleasure to tangle with]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Here&#8217;s a post from <a href="http://nothingbutawordbag.wordpress.com/">Nat Guest</a>. If you have an idea for a guest post brewing in your brain, email us: <a href="mailto:badrepeditors@gmail.com?subject=Guest pitch!">badrepeditors@gmail.com</a>.</strong></p>
<p>A confession: I write fanfiction.</p>
<p>I’ll let that sink in for a moment, whilst you judge me and leap to all the usual conclusions. At least half of them will be reasonably correct.</p>
<p>For starters, let’s clear up some myths. Fanfiction isn’t about porn. Or, at least, it isn’t <em>all</em> about porn. There are as many different genres out there as there are genres of fiction, as many reasons for reading and writing it as there are readers and writers of it. And it isn’t exactly an obscure pastime; on fanfiction.net (the largest, if most mainstream and therefore frowned-upon collection of fanfic) there are 593,713 fics listed under the Harry Potter category alone.</p>

Widely derided, it’s dismissed as the home of squeeing fangirls high on sugar and manga, or else of hopeless deviants: furries, kink-seekers and the downright filthy. Both of these are, technically, perfectly accurate. Fanfiction gets a bad rep, as do its advocates, and honestly &#8211; there&#8217;s good reason for that. A lot of it is absolutely terrible (the infamous <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/my-immortal-the-worst-fanfiction-ever">My Immortal</a>, for example), and a lot of it&#8217;s cringeworthy wish-fulfilment crawling with <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue">Mary Sues</a>. But to pretend that that’s <em>all</em> it is, is to do it a huge disservice.</p>
<p>Here’s one of my favourite quotes about it, used by Sheenagh Pugh in her book <a href="http://sheenagh.webs.com/thedemocraticgenre.htm"><strong>The Democratic Genre: Fanfiction in a Literary Context</strong></a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s always been high praise in Fannish circles to be told that you wrote a story so good it should be published, but sometimes, the highest praise is that it can&#8217;t be. Its very uniqueness, what creates it, makes it impossible to be anything else. Lots of people can write stories that fall into readable (more than you think, actually, but I&#8217;m flexible on the idea of readable), and many can write stories I&#8217;d pay to read, and even some write stories that could be published and be great. But there&#8217;s this small, fascinating group that write a story that belongs only to the fandom that created it. It&#8217;s like having a treasure you never have to share. It wraps itself in the canon and fanon and the author&#8217;s own mind that created it and takes it as its own so perfectly that you are so damn glad you went into that fandom, just grateful, just absolutely thrilled, because you get to read this.</p></blockquote>
<p>Every fic, without exception, is a product of its fandom. Reading a fic is not just reading a simple story: what you’re actually reading is an intertwining of fanlore, mixing in-jokes and terminology from one particular fandom, as well as from the broader history and narrative of fandom. That’s why they can appear so incoherent and ridiculous to the outside world at times. Fanfiction authors are less writing a story than weaving together a cultural tapestry.</p>
<p>Fanfiction has a proud and noble tradition, as anyone entrenched within the community will tell you. Every student of fanlore knows where the term <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shipping_(fandom)">“ship”</a> arose (<strong>X Files</strong> fandom), and where the term <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_fiction">“slash”</a> arose (<strong>Star Trek</strong> fandom). We have our own history; from the pre-internet fanzines, to early Usenet groups, right through to the great shipping wars of <strong>Harry Potter</strong> and the arguments over whether RPF (Real Person Fic; fanfiction about “real” people) is morally acceptable (the earliest known concrete example of RPF comes from the Bronte sisters, who used to write reams of stuff about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gondal_(fictional_country)">fictional country of Gondal</a>. It can be easily argued that there was a huge amount of RPF within the oral tradition, as people passed down stories about folkloric legends such as Robin Hood, King Arthur, and &#8211; yeah, I’m going to go there &#8211; Jesus). We know our lore and our mythology and our terminology, and we study it as arduously as disciples of any other body of text.</p>
<p>Whilst I do stress that a lot of fanfiction out there is non-sexual and non-romantic in content (it’s called <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenFic">gen fic</a>, yo, look it up), there’s an inarguable trend towards sexytimes. I’m all down with that; I like a bit of story with my porn, and I’m not a very visual person, so fanfiction is where I discovered a lot about myself and my own sexuality. I think I started reading fanfiction when I was about 13 or 14, and nowhere near, ahem, “active”. My first ever ship was Rupert Giles/Jenny Calendar. It was a while after that until I discovered slash, although that discovery was, frankly, inevitable – I had a bit of a sweet-tooth for Harry/Draco (Drarry, if you will). Fanfiction was (and still is!) a safe space to explore my own sexuality, and discover the kaleidoscope of sexualities, genders and identities that are out there. It was many years before I’d hear the name Judith Butler, or even hear the slightest mention of ‘queer theory’, but when I did, none of the ideas seemed particularly new to me.</p>
<p>Whilst there are plenty of male writers of fanfiction (especially within the gaming community &#8211; shout out to my little bro!) authorship is overwhelmingly female, and I don’t think that that’s a coincidence. Out in the real world, it’s difficult to own our own sexuality; there’s simply no room for shades of grey. You’re either frigid or a slut; you’re either straight or gay; your sexuality and identity is whatever people perceive when they look at you. But within the fanfiction community, away from the patriarchal mainstream, we can discover and explore how we feel about our own sexual and gender and personal identity. That’s something that I think has had more effect on my life than anything else. Through the medium of fandom, we can find out who we are, and what we like, and how we feel, all through just reading stories together. And then hopefully &#8211; eventually &#8211; we get to write our own story.</p>
<p>This is people writing because they love it, for no purpose other than writing for themselves and for other people who they vaguely know on the internet. It’s done purely for the joy of the thing. And it isn&#8217;t just about the fic itself; the fandom community is the most genre-savvy, theory-aware, innovative group of people I’ve ever had the pleasure to tangle with. This is a community alive with discussion about narrative, metanarrative, referentialism &#038; self referentialism, literary theory, gender and sexuality, social justice, morality, pop culture and in-jokes. I’d also argue that it’s an innately queer community; it not only exists between the cracks, but thrives on the cracks. And in a world where deconstruction and theory are often frowned upon as &#8220;thinking about things too much&#8221;, fandom is where I found a home.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Let's be honest, Star Trek has had some bad press over the years. Its gender politics were sometimes a bit wonky. But here's why it's my first love.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you asked me what my favourite TV show was, I could pick any number of shows at this point. I&#8217;m a bit of a small screen geek, and I collect shows (and their associated fandoms) almost as quickly as I lose interest in them once I&#8217;ve milked them of all the interesting bits. But only a few shows have stood the test of time, and one of them is my first love. I bet it&#8217;s your first love, too. In fact, it&#8217;s the first love of so many people that there&#8217;s a whole name for people like me: <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trekkie">Trekkie</a></em>.</p>
<h3>Wobbly Utopia</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s be honest, <strong>Star Trek</strong> has had some bad press over the years. Its gender politics were sometimes a bit wonky. Its racial politics also wobbled a bit. Its view of homosexuality was that it didn&#8217;t exist, and if it did, only aliens were gay (and if they were hot, semi-naked female aliens, so much the better). Most people in the Western world have seen at least one episode of the original series, and if they saw it at any point other than the &#8217;60s, they may have formed some negative views. There were probably Forehead Aliens involved, and the sets probably wobbled a bit. Captain Kirk spoke&#8230; with many&#8230; pauses&#8230; and&#8230; gestures. Spock raised an eyebrow. McCoy said, &#8220;He&#8217;s dead, Jim,&#8221; and at least one redshirt died to prove it was serious. And maybe it was interesting at the time, and had some interesting ideas, but then ten million spin-offs followed, and then there was a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0796366/">film</a>, and Zoe Saldana ran around in a miniskirt while Chris Pine fought Zachary Quinto in an erotically-charged episode of fisticuffs on the bridge.</p>
<p>This is all true, and the less said about the debacle of <strong>Enterprise,</strong> the better. But the thing is, none of this detracts from the achievements of the original series. I&#8217;ll start with this cast photo&#8230;</p>
<div id="attachment_6148" style="width: 262px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/tos_002.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6148" data-attachment-id="6148" data-permalink="/2011/11/07/my-first-love-star-trek/tos_002/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/tos_002.jpg?fit=590%2C700&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="590,700" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Original Trek, second season cast.

Image (c) Paramount</p></div>
<p>You&#8217;ll notice several things immediately:</p>
<p>1) everyone is wearing implausible outfits and has magical levitating hair;</p>
<p>2) the women are in miniskirts; and</p>
<p>3) the Russian guy is <em>definitely</em> wearing a wig.</p>
<p>But look a bit closer. This is a second season cast photo, so that places it in 1967/8, in a show marketed as<em> &#8220;Wagon Train to the Stars&#8221;</em>. There are people of different ethnicities and backgrounds, and there are also two women. Neither are secretaries.</p>
<p>I could talk at length about what <strong>Star Trek</strong> has done in promoting a vision of a multicultural, utopian future. The crew included a Russian crewmember at a time when the Cold War was going strong; it included a Japanese crewmember not so very long after WWII and not in a chop socky or waiter role. It featured the first interracial kiss on American television, when Kirk and Uhura are forced to embrace in the otherwise execrable episode, <em>Plato&#8217;s Stepchildren. </em>(In fact, the actors ensured that the actual kiss, rather than a simulated one, was shown, by pulling faces in all subsequent retakes.) The Federation itself is a multicultural utopia, where member nations hate each other and violently disagree on everything, and yet will work together for the common good just the same.</p>
<h3>Living in the Future</h3>
<p>I could focus instead on the technological impact. I could talk about classic <strong>Trek</strong> &#8216;inventing&#8217; a cornucopia of <a href="http://roadtickle.com/things-we-have-now-that-star-trek-invented/">future tech</a>, from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Cooper_(inventor)">mobile</a> <a href="http://www.inventor-strategies.com/cell-phone-invention.html">phones</a> to <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/3349667/Star-Trek-warp-drive-is-a-possibility-say-scientists.html">warp</a> <a href="http://news.discovery.com/space/roddenberrys-star-trek-inspires-generations-110908.html">drive</a> to <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/breakthrough-brings-star-trek-teleport-a-step-closer-451673.html">transporters</a>. Sure, warp drive remains an impossibility, and thus far transporters have only managed to send bits of plastic from one transporter to another, more akin to <strong>The Prestige</strong> than true teleportation, but how many people were thinking about it at all before <strong>Trek</strong> dreamed it up? Someone always has to dream up the idea before it can be invented. Sure, <strong>Trek</strong> only invented their Feinbergers because they didn&#8217;t have enough money and had to make do from scrounging through the waste bins of other shows, but that&#8217;s the beauty of it. Other people&#8217;s rubbish &#8211; when painted purple and hung on the wall &#8211; was enough to inspire people. Now<em> that&#8217;s</em> impressive.</p>
<h3>Fandom</h3>
<p>Or I could discuss the creation of slash fiction, of how it came about in the 1970s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_fiction">in response </a>to the <a href="http://slashphilosophy.livejournal.com/21477.html">cancellation</a> of <strong>Trek</strong>. Of how fans &#8211; primarily female and in their 20s and 30s &#8211; loved the characters and missed them so much that they got together and wrote stories for them. Many of them got published and ended up on the New York Times bestseller list &#8211; AC Crispin&#8217;s <strong>Yesterday&#8217;s Son</strong> was a fanzine before it was a book, for instance. I could talk about how they took the names Kirk and Spock and made them into Kirk/Spock, the slash in the middle indicating a homoerotic relationship. I&#8217;ve read the early slash efforts, and frankly, they&#8217;re not terribly good: it&#8217;s primarily people writing about sex they&#8217;re not having, in plots that aren&#8217;t convincing, with art that is a bit lacking. But the thing is, it&#8217;s astonishing that those early fanzines existed at all, that communities sprung up with such fervour and dedication to focus on one little show, long-cancelled. These days, &#8216;slash&#8217; means an m/m story, irrespective of fandom. Many young fans have no idea of the origin of the term and, influenced in equal measure by anime yaoi naming conventions, will mark the pairing with an x (eg. KirkxSpock), yet still refer to the relationship as &#8216;slash&#8217;. The name endures.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not all that <strong>Trek</strong> decided online. When the internet started up, the <strong>Trek</strong> groups had a tricky problem: both classic and <strong>TNG</strong>&#8216;s main characters shared letters. This was a disaster at a time when Usenet was the main source of contact, and subject lines were limited to a small number of characters. Naming and pairing conventions quickly sprang up, with the order of the letters indicating the pairing. American film rating systems were brought into use. <em>[FIC] TOS: New Dawn, K/S</em>,<em> Mc, NC-17 (1/1)</em> was instantly decipherable as a post title. <strong>Trek</strong> fandom has had a massive impact on fandom in general, its conventions and rules seeping through a multitude of others.</p>
<h3>Making History</h3>
<p>Then there are the people that Trek has influenced. How about <strong>Rev. Martin Luther King</strong>, for example? In a candid conversation with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nichelle_Nichols">Nichelle</a> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0629667/bio">Nichols</a>, he expressed his admiration for her work as Uhura, and <a href="http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-01-17/entertainment/27087605_1_lieutenant-uhura-nichols-today-gene-roddenberry">urged her to remain on the show</a> at a time when she was <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2011/01/17/star-treks-nichelle-nichols-on-how-martin-luther-king-king-jr-changed-her-life/">considering quitting</a>. Or maybe <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/08/02/unsung-heroes-mae-jemison/"><strong>Dr Mae Jamison</strong></a>, the first African American woman in space. She, too, <a href="http://www.spacestationinfo.com/female-astronauts-24-Mae%20Jemison.html">watched the show as a child </a>and was<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/dept/news/stanfordtoday/ed/9607/pdf/ST9607mjemison.pdf"> inspired by the example </a>that Nichelle Nichols&#8217; Uhura set.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll protect you, fair maiden.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry, neither!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8211; Sulu tries to &#8216;rescue&#8217; Uhura, but she&#8217;s having none of it in the first season episode, <strong>The Naked Time</strong>.</p></blockquote>

<p>How can you NOT love a show that gives you this much awesomeness?</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; I hear you cry, &#8220;but you&#8217;ve only talked about the <em>impact</em> of the show, not the show itself! I distinctly recall some dodgy gender politics at work&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<h3>A Handy Viewing Guide for the New Recruit</h3>
<p>Yes. OK, I admit it. <strong>Star Trek</strong>, like many shows at the time, had its writing farmed out to a pool of writers that took story outlines and turned them into scripts. Maybe they knew and loved the show and its characters, maybe they didn&#8217;t know them from Adam. Sometimes you had Harlan Ellison delivering <em>City on the Edge of Forever</em>, and sometimes you had Arthur Heinemann&#8217;s <em>The Way to Eden</em>, where space hippies sing songs and the viewer writhes in agony. So what? No show out there can claim to have 100% hit rate, and when <strong>Trek</strong> got it right, they <em>really</em> got it right. So here are a few episodes to check out, mostly from Season 1, but a couple from the later seasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Where No Man Has Gone Before</em>: where two members of the crew develop god-like powers and the inevitable happens. There is gratuitous eye-candy, in the shape of Kirk&#8217;s bared chest. Meanwhile the lead female character is dressed in exactly the same uniform as everyone else, down to the ridiculous bell-bottoms. She&#8217;s the ship&#8217;s psychiatrist, and ends up saving the day&#8230; sort of.</li>
<li><em><a href="http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Charlie_X_(episode)">Charlie X</a></em>: where a young boy with god-like powers&#8230; yes, OK. But this is a creepy, scary little episode, with eye candy provided by the semi-naked Kirk wrestling for no apparent reason. More disturbing is Charlie&#8217;s attempted rape of a crewwoman, his reactions coarse and demanding and selfish, and hers grown-up and mature. He may be the one using violence, but she never once relinquishes her control.</li>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;There&#8217;s no right way to hit a woman.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>&#8211; James Kirk to Charlie X, after the latter slaps Yeoman Rand&#8217;s bottom, <strong>Charlie X</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<li><em>The Menagerie</em>: where the original pilot is reworked. <strong>Trek</strong> does loyalty, captivity, mind-control and extreme measures.</li>
<li><strong>Balance of Terror</strong>: the Cold War episode, where Kirk informs a crewmember that bigotry has no place on his bridge.</li>
<li><strong>Devil in the Dark</strong>: where the crew learn not to make assumptions about appearances.</li>
<li><strong>City on the Edge of Forever</strong>: where Harlan Ellison <a href="http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/The_City_on_the_Edge_of_Forever_(episode)">disavows all knowledge </a>of this rather excellent episode. Kirk, Spock and McCoy end up in 1930s Earth, where Kirk meets Joan Collins, a peace activist who runs a homeless shelter. She&#8217;s strong and independent and a visionary, and is unmistakably the love of his life. (Therefore, according to the requirements of drama, she must die.)</li>
<li><strong>Mirror Mirror</strong>: Where Uhura wears an even more revealing uniform, and evil!Spock mind-invades McCoy.
<li><strong>The Enterprise Incident</strong>: where the opposing Romulan commander is female, and is tricked in the expected way. What isn&#8217;t expected is her dignity throughout. Kirk and Spock treat her throughout as their equal.</li>
<li><strong>Is There In Truth No Beauty?</strong>: Where <strong>Trek</strong> had a blind character, and had her as the lead guest character for the episode.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Turnabout_Intruder_(episode)">Turnabout Intruder</a></strong>: where Kirk and an old flame &#8211; who has a grudge &#8211; trade bodies. This episode, for all its flaws, is <em>fascinating</em>. Janice Lester was a contemporary of Kirk&#8217;s, and they were briefly involved. However, she never got command, something she attributed to her gender. In <strong>Trek</strong>-world, she has no argument: her gender is irrelevant. In 1960s America, this is something so obvious that it was rarely mentioned: <em>of course</em> her gender stopped her from getting command, no woman could possibly be a military commander! Lester&#8217;s fury is so intently realised that you can&#8217;t help feeling sorry for her, for all her insanity&#8230; and rooting for her, just a little.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Your world of starship captains doesn&#8217;t admit women.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8211; Janice Lester, <strong>Turnabout Intruder</strong></p></blockquote>

I&#8217;ve talked at length about classic <strong>Trek</strong>, and I still don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve explained why I love it so much. Maybe there isn&#8217;t a reason. Maybe I just saw it at the right time, with the right mindset. I&#8217;d just arrived in the UK, and English was a struggle. I didn&#8217;t really understand what was going on, and I don&#8217;t think I understood that Spock was an alien. But what I definitely understood that Uhura and Chapel and Rand and Number One &#8211; they were women, and they were astronauts. Having grown up on a diet of <strong>Valentina Tereshkova</strong>, it was natural to add them to my list of space-going women. And with so many women setting an example, how could I NOT want to be an astronaut myself?</p>
<p>So, there it is: my deepest, darkest secret. I studied maths and music as a child because of <strong>Trek</strong>. I got into fandom because of <strong>Trek</strong>, trying to navigate newsgroups in a cybercafe at age 13 when an Amstrad was the height of luxury. I have the DVDs, and a few of the books, and many of the friends. And above it all, when people ask what I want to do when I grow up, my immediate, unspoken reaction is, &#8220;I want to be an astronaut.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tell me that&#8217;s a bad thing.</p>
