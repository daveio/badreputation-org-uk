										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Perhaps one reason we now refer almost exclusively to ‘actors’ is that, for the longest time, the word ‘actress’ was synonymous with ‘prostitute’. Presumably this relates to the Immodesties they are obliged to suffer on stage; as <strong>Shakespeare in Love</strong> taught us all so well, pre-Restoration these were considered so severe that women were not allowed on stage at all.</p>

<p>This exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery looks at the moment immediately after Charles II reversed this rule, and it’s a fun little look at some portraits, caricatures and paraphernalia of women who <em>were</em> allowed on stage, ‘from Nell Gwyn to Sarah Siddons’. It’s focused on portraits, but there are some super little earthenware tiles with different actresses on them in Room 3. There’s also a facsimile of the Yellow Pages-style brothel directory, <strong>Harris’ List of Covent Garden Ladies; or, The Man of Pleasure’s Kalendar</strong>, illustrating the fall from grace of the once ‘Convent and Garden’ of Westminster Abbey – a bit too close to eighteenth-century Theatreland for PR-comfort. Since its <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Harriss-Covent-Garden-Revealing-History/dp/0752435469">reissue by the History Press</a> this book has now achieved some cult status – the guy next to me, looking at it, said to his companion, ‘You know, Gladys: Harris’ List – that’s the one we’ve got in the toilet’.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nell_Gwyn">Nell</a> (c.1651-87) opens this exhibition – a talented comic actress, although she is popularly most recognised for inspiring Charles II’s last words ‘Let not poor Nelly starve’ (she survived him by barely a year, fact fans). There are two portraits of her here, in both of which she’s got her mammaries out. This exhibition would have these as evidence of her ‘skillful manipulation’ rather than ‘brazen hussydom’; the second portrait shows her <a href="http://i.thisislondon.co.uk/i/pix/2011/10/18-nell-gwyn-415.jpg">naked to the waist</a> and looking directly at the viewer with a gaze at once languid and challenging. You might be reminded of Manet’s <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/Manet%2C_Edouard_-_Olympia%2C_1863.jpg"><strong>Olympia</strong></a>, condemned as ‘vulgar’ and ‘immoral’ on its first exhibition at 1863, mainly because the nude is looking directly at the viewer rather than obligingly turning her head away for better ogling comfort. And indeed, such a tension between looking and being looked at probably underscored a lot of the moral uncertainty about the early actresses.</p>
<p>Later on, we get <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Siddons">Sarah Siddons</a> (1755-1831), powerful, tragic <em>grande dame</em>. She appears in Room 3 painted by Thomas Lawrence as public intellectual, tutor to the royal children – and at a vantage point that forces us to look up at her imperious face, rather than to avert our eyes from her naked bosom. This is hung alongside a number of grandiose actress-as-Muse paintings, large as their themes, and also including Muses of Comedy and society amateurs like Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire.</p>
<p>But even in the late eighteenth century ‘actress’ still wasn’t a career you’d want for your wife. Thespiennes like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Ann_Linley">Elizabeth Ann Sheridan</a> (1754-1792) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Farren">Elizabeth Farren</a> (1759-1829) – both exhibited here – gave up their acting careers, on request, upon marriage. While the eighteenth-century gentleman was not renowned for being into female careers in general, the issue here seems to be more ‘other men looking at your wife’ than anything else: after all, these men were ‘forward thinking’ enough to marry an actress in the first place. Perhaps they were nervous of the number of early actresses, like Nell, who had affairs with kings and nobles. If so, they had a good few hundred years of uncertainty left: Edward VII was still pretty into actresses at the turn of the twentieth century. ‘I’ve spent enough on you to build a battleship’ he complained to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lillie_Langtry">Lillie Langtry</a> (1853-1929), eliciting the tart response ‘And you’ve spent enough in me to float one.’ (It may have been such impertinence that led to her replacement by another actress, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Bernhardt">Sarah Bernhardt</a>, shortly afterwards.)</p>

<p>But, as this exhibition shows, one of the primary moral gripes with these early actresses was actually about something a bit unexpected: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travesti_(theatre)"><em>travesti</em></a> roles many of them built careers on. There are some fascinating visual representations in this exhibition of actresses – like Dorothy Jordan (1761-1816), whose bosom apparently ‘concealed everything but its own charms’ – in their famous ‘breech’ roles, both Shakespearean (stalwarts like <strong>Twelfth Night</strong> and <strong>As You Like It</strong>) and just… male (Tom Thumb). It seems that, after decades of young boys aping womanhood, the first actresses set themselves the challenge of continuing the noble tradition: it was conscious decision, rather than occasional dramatic necessity, for many of them to adopt the <em>travesti</em>.</p>
<p>The Immodesty here implied resulted in endless caricatures, many of which are exhibited here. My favourite was entitled ‘An Actress at her Toilet; or, <a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/collectionimages/AN00142/AN00142551_001_l.jpg">Miss Brazen Just Breecht’</a> – though perhaps even stranger were the portraits of various male actors, including David Garrick, in drag – enormous hoop and all – as a kind of forerunner to the pantomime dame.</p>
<p>Take a feminist friend and thrash it out in the Portrait Gallery café with their superior yoghurt and granola, says this reviewer. And visit John Donne on the top floor, if he’s not gone into cleaning yet.</p>

So here I am talking about traditional Anglo-American music. Problem solved.</p>
<p>I was also inspired by a question from <a title="Twitter - Feminister" href="http://twitter.com/FeministInti">@FeministInti</a> to her twitter followers: do you know any folk songs that feature gender-based violence? The answer is yes, AND HOW. In a few moments we had amassed enough for a limited edition CD box set of traditional songs about rape, domestic violence and murdered women.</p>
<p>It tends to be these songs that a lot of modern folkish artists have picked up on. Yes, I’m looking at you Nick Cave. And you, Decemberists, although I love you. There are also a lot (a LOT) of waiflike folk girls with guitars singing about how love is like a cloud or they’re not sure which handbag matches their heart, as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S8UxfY9HtY">parodied</a> by Bill Bailey.</p>
<p>As an antidote to the murdery and misogynist on the one hand and the mindlessly insipid and pathetic on the other I thought I would take this opportunity to share and celebrate some traditional songs in which women come out on top.</p>
<p>Note: Because the songs are hundreds of years old in some cases there’s quite a lot of variety over names and lyrics. I managed to find versions of nearly all of them on Spotify and have made a collaborative playlist so y’all can add any others you find: <a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/sajarina/playlist/3HNBKRwCGTqGMVKHko3PG4">Kickass women in folk songs</a>.</p>

<p>Now THIS is what I’m talking about &#8211; songs about women dressing as sailors, hunters and highwaymen, whether to find their true love or just for kicks. Some of them sound a little unhinged: like Sovay, who is prepared to blow her lover’s head off if he gives up the love token she has given him. But the heroine in &#8216;The Golden Glove&#8217; is very endearing as she cleverly arranges matters so that she can marry the man she loves (and “enjoy” him, as she sings gleefully).</p>
<p>If you’d like more stories of derring-do like this, I recommend Dianne Dugaw’s <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=btgPj6eDZvMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=warrior+women+and+popular+balladry&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dg4f9Pc0pG&amp;sig=iG_Dy87l_aYVOj1ugB8hkkyUXps&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=8eKgTbuFPNGahQfCo-n1BA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"><strong>Warrior Women and Popular Balladry, 1650-1850</strong></a>.</p>

<h2>Bold and crafty women</h2>
<p>The Crafty Maid and Lovely Joan outsmart their arrogant would-be seducers and make off with their horses. Sally Brown kicks the ass of the Cruel Youth, saving her own life and avenging the deaths of the ‘pretty maidens’ who went before her, and the Bonny Lass of Angelsey dances the king and 15 of his knights out of their swag.</p>

<h3>Silver Dagger</h3>
<p>The woman in Joan Baez’s version of the Silver Dagger decides not to risk getting her heart broken by keeping clear of love altogether. Whether she’s right or wrong, I like that she makes a choice.</p>
<blockquote><p>“My daddy is a handsome devil<br />
He&#8217;s got a chain five miles long<br />
And on every link a heart does dangle<br />
Of another maid he&#8217;s loved and wronged.”</p></blockquote>
