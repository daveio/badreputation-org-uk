<li><em>Next up in our Women in Horror Recognition Month blogfest (and taking the torch from Maura McHugh) is writer <a href="http://chriswritesapocalypses.blogspot.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>Chris Farnell</strong></a>, who is our go-to consultant for bespoke zombie apocalypse contingency planning. (Wanna join the guest blogging fun? Send your pitches to <a href="mailto:badrepeditors@gmail.com"><strong>badrepeditors@gmail.com</strong></a>.)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>I love zombie movies. <a href="http://chriswritesapocalypses.blogspot.co.uk/" target="_blank">I run a blog about them</a>, I just helped run an event at the Science Museum about them, and I once sent BadRep writer Hannah Chutzpah to get <a href="http://hannahdoublebarrel.wordpress.com/2011/04/30/royalweddingzombie/" target="_blank">arrested</a> just so I could write about <a href="http://chriswritesapocalypses.blogspot.co.uk/2011/05/17-royal-wedding-zombie-flash-mob.html" target="_blank">a zombie flash mob</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2013/01/31/guest-post-author-maura-mchugh-recommends-more-women-in-horror-for-2013/womeninhorror2013logo/" rel="attachment wp-att-13088"><img data-attachment-id="13088" data-permalink="/2013/01/31/guest-post-author-maura-mchugh-recommends-more-women-in-horror-for-2013/womeninhorror2013logo/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/womeninhorror2013logo.jpg?fit=720%2C696&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="720,696" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="womeninhorror2013logo" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/womeninhorror2013logo.jpg?fit=300%2C290&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/womeninhorror2013logo.jpg?fit=720%2C696&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-13088 alignleft" alt="womeninhorror2013logo" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/womeninhorror2013logo.jpg?resize=249%2C240" width="249" height="240" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/womeninhorror2013logo.jpg?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w, https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/womeninhorror2013logo.jpg?resize=300%2C290&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 249px) 100vw, 249px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>One of the things about being a fan of all things zombie is that on a regular basis I come across articles declaring the end of the &#8216;zombie craze&#8217;, saying that all the stories about zombies have been told, that the genre is exhausted. These articles will usually involve puns.</p>
<p>It’s an argument that essentially misses the point of how both people and stories work &#8211; we don’t tell a story and then move onto the next one, we tell the same story over and over, from every possible angle, trying to tease out something new or rediscovered each time. One of the reasons I love zombie movies is they’re full of opportunities for that.</p>
<p>But that said, there is one zombie story that I have yet to see told anywhere (and if it has, and I missed it, please tell me. I wanna see). Particularly, it involves a group of people that zombie movies have led me to believe could make up as much as a third of the global population &#8211; women.</p>
<p>Zombie movies have, on the whole, managed to avoid most of the standard horror movie tropes when it comes to women. The amount of alcohol and sex a woman enjoys doesn’t usually directly correlate with their survival chances. Chase scenes rarely take place while female zombie fighters are in their underwear.</p>

There was another woman in that film as well, but nobody ever remembers either her or her boyfriend, so we can safely ignore them. However, after that initial outing George Romero actually seemed to learn, and the way women in zombie movies are portrayed generally has improved as a result.</p>
<p>By 1978, and <strong>Dawn of the Dead,</strong> the main female character (Gaylen Ross&#8217;s Francine) may have found herself in the role of “house mom”, and not just because she was pregnant. But she fought against that role, insisting that the others teach her how to fire a gun and fly the escape helicopter, skills which led to her being the movie’s only survivor.</p>
<p><strong>Day of the Dead</strong> (1985) had only one female character, but Sarah (Lori Cardille) was also very much the brains of the film, a badass, level headed under pressure, and again, one of the three characters to make it through the film.</p>
<p>When <strong>Night of the Living Dead</strong> was remade by Romero in 1990, Barbra, our alternately catatonic/screaming heroine from the first film, was now &#8211; played by Patricia Tallman &#8211; also a badass who knew her way around a firearm.</p>

You can see it in Selena in <strong>28 Days Later</strong> (and yes, that is a proper zombie movie), in Ana, the lead protagonist in the <strong>Dawn of the Dead</strong> remake, in Wichita and Little Rock in <strong>Zombieland</strong> (Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin, right), and in Kelly, the lead protagonist in Charlie Brooker’s <strong>Dead Set</strong>. Even in <strong>Shaun of the Dead</strong>, Shaun’s girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) is the level-headed straight woman to the comedy antics of the rest of the cast.</p>
<p>And now we’re getting to the nub of the matter. Liz is the straight woman.</p>
<p>You see, zombie movies come in many different flavours. They can be war movies, economic parables, satire, or an examination of the violence inherent in human nature. They can even, with their “bunch of people locked in a building together” format, be a sitcom. But in most cases, one thing you see a lot of in zombie movies is wish fulfilment.</p>
<p>It’s the reason why so many perfectly sensible, realistic people have more detailed plans for a zombie apocalypse than they do for a fire breaking out in their home. There’s an appeal in the idea that real life, with its bills, jobs, relationships and traffic jams, might one day give way to the sort of massive catastrophe that would finally reveal the inner badass you’ve been all along.</p>
<p>Zombie movies are filled with guys who lead boring or screwed up lives before the outbreak hits, only to rise to the occasion and become the hero. Shaun is stuck in a go-nowhere job and has just been dumped by his girlfriend when the zombies turn up. <strong>Zombieland</strong>’s Columbus is a phobic shut-in who plays endless <strong>World of Warcraft</strong> and has “perfectly justifiable to speculate on” virginity. <strong>28 Days Later</strong>’s Jim is a bicycle courier who goes from being a liability at the start of the film to single-handedly taking down a house full of armed, trained soldiers by the climax. Even Ash Williams, famed zombie killer extraordinaire (despite the <strong>Evil Dead</strong> films, I’m sorry, not counting as proper zombie films. I don’t make the rules) started out as a shop clerk.</p>
<p>But it’s always the guy. The guy is allowed to start out hopeless and go through the learning curve required to reach the point where he’s massacring zombies with a lawnmower (<strong>Braindead</strong>, incidentally, is another example of this trope). Female characters in zombie movies nearly always start out with their badass qualifications already in place. Only guys get to use the zombie apocalypse to escape how little they can cope with day-to-day life.</p>
<p>And it’s not because this is an exclusively a male fantasy, not by a long shot. If you doubt me, do a quick search for “zombie survival” among the women of OKCupid. Talk to Mary Hamilton, one of the brains behind <a href="http://zombielarp.co.uk/" target="_blank">Zombie LARP</a>, or Naomi Alderman of <a href="https://www.zombiesrungame.com/" target="_blank">Zombies, Run!</a>. Talk to my own sister, who has an imaginative, if fatally flawed zombie survival plan that involves stealing a train. Even with my fairly limited social media following, I was able to find five women with zombie survival plans in the space of an hour (and one of them had three plans, depending on her circumstances).</p>
<p>So, going back to the beginning, this is the new zombie film I want to see. Show us a zombie film with a hapless female protagonist caught in a shitty dead end job with mounting bills and a disaster of a love life. Then, over the course of the film, have her discover she has a knack for clean decapitations and barricade building.</p>
<p>It’s not particularly groundbreaking, but I can’t find that film out there, and I’ve looked hard. If you make this film, I’m telling you, there’s a huge readymade audience for it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/tomofthedamned"><strong>Tom Richards</strong></a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/theatreofdamned"><strong>Stewart Pringle</strong></a> are the co-artistic directors of <a href="http://www.theatreofthedamned.com/"><strong>Theatre of the Damned</strong></a>, creators of the <a href="http://www.londonhorrorfestival.com/"><strong>London Horror Festival</strong></a>, and the co-directors and writers of <a href="http://www.londonhorrorfestival.com/shows/revenge-of-the-grand-guignol"><strong>The Revenge of the Grand Guignol</strong></a>, which is running until 27th November at London&#8217;s Courtyard Theatre in Hoxton.</p>
<p>Here guest blogger <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/@lydnicholas"><strong>Lydia</strong></a> continues <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/11/21/guest-interview-talking-horror-with-theatre-of-the-damned-part-12">yesterday&#8217;s interview</a> about representations of women in horror, and what it&#8217;s been like resurrecting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Guignol">Grand Guignol</a> for a modern audience&#8230;</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/damned1.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="8570" data-permalink="/2011/11/21/guest-interview-talking-horror-with-theatre-of-the-damned-part-12/damned-2/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/damned1.jpg?fit=168%2C72&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="168,72" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="damned" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/damned1.jpg?fit=168%2C72&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/damned1.jpg?fit=168%2C72&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8570" title="damned" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/damned1.jpg?resize=168%2C72" alt="Block serif font in capitals spelling Theatre of the Damned against black - their logo.

<p><strong>So, we&#8217;ve just got done talking about the rise of the &#8216;saw a woman in half&#8217; phenomenon &#8211; seems like there are both political  and practical reasons why horror can fall into misogyny. Is this stuff as common as people think?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tom:</strong> There’s tons of it. Tons and tons. We choose not to put on plays like that as they don’t interest us, but in the 1940s and 50s when the Grand Guignol was trying to compete with Hammer<em></em>, they wrote pure exploitation crap. It’s true of all kinds of horror: you can tell a form is dying when it spills out pure sexualised violence. It doesn’t take much money or skill to produce, but it sells, so the lower end of the horror market is flooded with this kind of thing.</p>
<p><strong>Stew:</strong> The nadir of all creative horror genres, periods of productivity, and exciting works always end with women being hacked up. Bad horror tends towards unthinking misogyny and ultraviolence.</p>
<p><strong>Tom:</strong> The <strong>Friday the 13th</strong> sequels, for example, are aimed at teenage boys who want to see tits and gore. It’s not that they&#8217;re interested in sexualised violence itself, or damaging women; in fact anything emotionally realistic would probably upset or disturb them &#8211; they just want as much sex and as much violence as possible within a given time span.</p>

A lot of the women being killed are topless or have recently been topless, or are even mid-coitus. We’re seeing it again now in the torture porn genre – a term people argue with, but I think it&#8217;s completely accurate. In <strong>Hostel</strong> for example, all we’re seeing is girls chosen for their looks being chopped up.</p>
<p><strong>Tom:</strong> More than that &#8211; they&#8217;re being chopped up in such a way that it’s clear it’s supposed to be a turn-on. Because the films have decent production values, it’s harder to spot. The people producing this stuff are far more competent with a camera and effects than whatever clown the studios hired to make <strong>Friday the 13th</strong> part 8. So instead of being a sequence of disjointed tat, it lovingly focuses on the bodies, on the violence, in a style that is erotic in and of itself.</p>
<p><strong>Stew:</strong> What we’re refuting here, and in our theatre, is that these stereotypes are intrinsic to horror. It’s a lot more interesting than that. Horror is what occurs at the negative extremity of human experience: the points at which we don’t understand something, can’t cope with something, or are driven to actions that are well outside the boundaries of normal behaviour. That covers everything from hauntings to murder and massacres, death, and losing your mind. Anything that we are not fit to cope with can produce horror. It can go as far as Lovecraft and involve gods from beyond time, or it can be a woman killing her child. Violence can be a part of it, but it’s not necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Tom:</strong> You can have extreme violence without horror. There are places the two cross over. You could have a legitimate discussion about whether, say, <strong>Rambo </strong>is a horror film, because it is undoubtedly a film that sets out to be horrific.</p>
<p><strong>Stew: </strong>And then there are films which use the tropes of horror but are not horror. Shaun of the Dead is very gory, and terrible things happen, but really it’s not a horror film because it doesn’t exist to horrify.</p>
<p><strong>Tom:</strong> There are a lot of horror comedies where horror provides a kind of desktop theme &#8211; the styles and shapes, but not the core. And then you have true horror comedies like <strong>Drag Me To Hell</strong> and almost all of Sam Raimi’s films: genuinely scary, genuinely unnerving and deeply funny.</p>
<p><strong>Those cross-genre films are often the ones that freak me out the most &#8211; you get more involved and don’t know what to expect or what’s expected of you.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tom:</strong> Grand Guignol scripts often work towards implicating an audience and making it disgusted with itself &#8211; it works you up so that you’re desperate for the payoff, so you want to see mayhem; you want to see everything destroyed. It reveals a lot about people and it’s fascinating, but you have to be careful not to be merely titillating &#8211; if they’re never revolted by it then they’ll never really face the facet of themselves that wanted it. When it’s successful, it exposes some fucked up inner feelings buried in the audience’s subconscious and assumptions.</p>

<p><strong>Tom:</strong> I think that’s actually become rather dated. It was never important that she was innocent, more that she was sympathetic. Back in 1890, even 1950, that meant virginal and naïve. That was the woman men wanted to be with and male writers thought women wanted to be. But those same cynical reasons are why in more modern stuff – not just horror &#8211; female characters are becoming more sophisticated, interesting and independent. It just reflects the kind of person the majority of men want to be with.</p>
<p><strong>Cynical, but it rings true. What do these tropes say about men?<br />
</strong><br />
<strong>Tom: </strong>Men seem to be pretty blasé about male characters in horror. They just want them to die<br />
interestingly. Unless it’s the killer, and even then, it’s just hoping for more killing.</p>
<p><strong>Stew:</strong> There are very few strong male heroes in horror. Maybe <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ash_Williams">Ash</a>, but he’s a buffoon who happens to save the day. Shaun, in <strong>Shaun of the Dead</strong>, has toughness about him, but again is buffoonish. There aren’t a lot of great male characters running around in horror as a contrast for the problems with women.</p>
<p><strong>Tom:</strong> A lot of men die too, it’s just that their deaths aren’t lingered over. In horror films where there’s a long series of victims being killed off sequentially, perhaps the numbers will be split equally male/female, but the last one is almost always a young woman.</p>
<p><strong>Stew:</strong> She has survived to the end because she displayed a level of ingenuity that the others &#8211; male and female &#8211; were incapable of. It harks back to the resourceful gothic heroine.</p>
<p><strong>Tom:</strong> So now we have a combination of factors: women are more likely to sympathise with a resourceful, interesting woman, and men are more likely to feel emotional involvement and protectiveness towards a young, attractive, likeable female character. It lacks subtlety, but for a form which doesn’t focus on character development it often turns out like that.<br />
<strong><br />
I see an interesting link to the politics of violence, and in particular sexual violence. There’s still a deeply entrenched assumption that male victims should somehow have been able to fight off their attacker; by being defeated you have been proved not to be a proper man, whatever that means. And the shame related to that can be felt to be worse than the crime itself.<br />
</strong><br />
<strong>Stew:</strong> Well, the killers in cheap slasher films, after hacking up topless women, will taunt male victims about their lack of manliness. Freddie and Chucky will always make wisecracks concerning the masculinity of their male victims. They bully and humiliate them before killing them. And then Jason, who has a hockey mask, massive weapon and is all muscles: he’s kind of an <em>ur</em>-male; masculinity pushed to a horrific extreme.</p>
<p><strong>Tom:</strong> Of course, this is in slashers, one of the lowest forms of horror; it doesn’t really go anywhere interesting with those ideas.</p>
<p><strong>It’s kind of interesting that even in it’s most simplistic form, people are so addicted to these ideas &#8211; the miseryporn biography stories about horrific child abuse that my elderly female relatives are addicted to have so many of the same tropes.<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tom:</strong> I think it’s an urge that is common, if not to everyone, then to the vast majority of people, to vicariously experience the negative extremes of human possibilities. To understand somehow what that feels like. The forms in which people enjoy or find it acceptable to explore that differ, but it’s not exclusive to 16-24 year old men.</p>
<p><strong>Lydia:</strong> So in fact we have ended up with several distinct things which go by the name ‘horror’. There’s the inherited tropes and structures &#8211; the kind of desktop theme that you describe horror comedies playing with, all capes and bats and fainting virgins. Then there’s the market – primarily made up of teenage boys &#8211; for unsophisticated tits and violence served up as concentrated as possible, so they sometimes end up overlapping and confused. And then, finally, we have various approaches to the exploration of the negative extremes of human experience. Since the latter plays on the audience’s deeply help assumptions and fears, in its weaker forms it can slip into mere titillation and reinforce stereotypes, but when elevated to an art from, it can shake and move you, reveal yourself to yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Stew:</strong> And be fucking scary, yeah.</p>
