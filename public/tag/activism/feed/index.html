										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A wise man<sup><a href="/2012/10/22/found-feminism-rubber-face-putin/#footnote_0_12353" id="identifier_0_12353" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" Terry Pratchett, THUD (particularly in the form of Granny Weatherwax, he&rsquo;s the source of a lot of useful moral philosophy). ">1</a></sup> once said that you ignore the writing on the walls at your peril. I hope the same is true of stickers.</p>
<p>In a world where it&#8217;s increasingly hard to get your message across, and available methods of communication are becoming more and more sophisticated, it&#8217;s refreshing to see a return to the simple things in life.</p>
<p>Like slapping a sticker somewhere nice and prominent that screams <em>FREE PUSSY RIOT</em> in fat felt tip pen.</p>
<p>I found this beauty a couple of months ago whilst walking across the Golden Jubilee pedestrian bridge. Sitting loud and proud, obviously homemade, with bright colours and a take-no-prisoners message.</p>
<div id="attachment_12354" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Rubber-Face-Putin.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12354" data-attachment-id="12354" data-permalink="/2012/10/22/found-feminism-rubber-face-putin/rubber-face-putin/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Rubber-Face-Putin.jpg?fit=600%2C487&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="600,487" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.65&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;GT-I9100&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1344787927&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;3.97&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;32&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.0046082949308756&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Rubber Face Putin" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Rubber-Face-Putin.jpg?fit=300%2C243&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Rubber-Face-Putin.jpg?fit=600%2C487&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-12354" title="Rubber Face Putin" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Rubber-Face-Putin-300x243.jpg?resize=300%2C243" alt="Brightly coloured hand made sticker with chunky text in yellow and blue reading Free Pussy Riot, scibbled at the top is Fuck Rubber Face Putin.

<p>So, why is this a Found Feminism?</p>
<p>Well, obviously there&#8217;s the show of support for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pussy_Riot" target="_blank">Pussy Riot</a> and the spreading of their message. Whoever slapped this on the wall was inspired to make and display the sticker themselves. I hope there are hundreds of them stuck around London. I only found the one. I hope other people find more. I hope they make their own.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also going to add points for the artwork, done in a way that echoes feminist punk stylings. It&#8217;s that hand-drawn aesthetic of &#8220;we did this in our bedroom&#8221; personal creation. It mirrors the hand-knitted balaclavas of the band members, and it&#8217;s the heart and soul of grassroots movements.</p>
<p>Plus, it&#8217;s funny.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying that feminism should be side-splitting all the time, although I do dislike that stereotype about feminists as po-faced, dungarees-wearing, yoghurt-plaiting monsters<sup><a href="/2012/10/22/found-feminism-rubber-face-putin/#footnote_1_12353" id="identifier_1_12353" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" Actually, I really like dungarees, and would quite happily wear them, especially for their iconic status in (mis)representing feminism. But that&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m a real person and not a stereotype! I cannot plait yoghurt, however. ">2</a></sup> who hate all fun and all jokes. But being able to make someone smile when you get your point across can be valuable &#8211; and who wouldn&#8217;t grin at this sticker, with its cheerful two fingers up to one of the most terrifying and powerful men in the world? Doesn&#8217;t matter how strong you think you are, Mr Putin &#8211; the writing on the wall in London thinks you&#8217;re a dick.</p>
<p>Finally, there&#8217;s the political message here. The sticker, and Pussy Riot, are part of a rekindling of the political power of feminism, reminding us all that there&#8217;s more we can do (much, much more) than form elegant critiques of the use of the female nude in art for the Sunday edition of the national newspapers.</p>
<p>There are problems out in the world that an active, aware and politicised feminist movement can work to solve. Should work to solve. And the fact that someone with a few highlighter pens and a handful of stickers is getting out there and having a go, in their own way, at doing it should put a rocket under those of us who have more reach and power to do what we can.</p>
<p>So yeah, fuck rubber face Putin.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, you&#8217;ve read <a href="http://www.hivaware.org.uk/">HIV Aware</a>, you&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/12/01/markgrafs-world-aids-day-rampage/">mythbusted with us</a> (and thank you, by the way, everyone who linked and RT&#8217;d that post on <a href="http://twitter.com/BadRepUK">Twitter</a> and elsewhere)&#8230; what now?</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/ribbons.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="8816" data-permalink="/2011/12/02/a-post-world-aids-day-linkpost-go-forth-and-read/ribbons/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/ribbons.jpg?fit=375%2C500&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="375,500" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="ribbons" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/ribbons.jpg?fit=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/ribbons.jpg?fit=375%2C500&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-8816 alignright" title="ribbons" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/ribbons.jpg?resize=300%2C400" alt="Image of a giant red AIDS awareness ribbon made by scattering many individual little ribbons on a white sheet in the looped shape of a ribbon. Image by Flickr user lusciousblopster, shared under Creative Commons licence" width="300" height="400" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/ribbons.jpg?w=375&amp;ssl=1 375w, https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/ribbons.jpg?w=225&amp;ssl=1 225w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>What about stigma? As we tweeted yesterday, Act Aware isn&#8217;t, and should never be, about judging and othering people who are living with HIV. It should never be about erasure.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for all of us, the majority of mainstream media approaches to HIV issues in the UK are either woefully ill-informed, groaning under the weight of crappily pieced-together assumptions, often even kind of creepily bigoted, or just plain fifteen years out of date. Even with <a href="http://www.nat.org.uk/Information-and-Resources/Media-reporting.aspx">NAT&#8217;s helpful press guide</a> freely available. Hooray.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s a thing: if you&#8217;re reading this, you&#8217;re in luck. For lo, the internet is as full of glory as it is full of shit. And with very little effort on your part it basically becomes your own PERSONAL BULLSHIT ESCAPE TUNNEL. And we&#8217;re about to make it even easier.</p>
<p>So here are some World AIDS Day links you might or might not have seen before, which we&#8217;ve been reading at BadRep Towers. Beyond Acting Aware and reading myths and facts, are real people. So go and read about them. Make it so!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.thebody.com/"><strong>The Body</strong></a>: this is a really, really valuable resource. It&#8217;s also a blogging platform for a large team of people living with and/or campaigning about HIV and AIDS, featuring <a href="http://www.thebody.com/index/inspire.html?ic=3001">personal stories</a> from a wide range of backgrounds and age groups (though we have not found any trans* men&#8217;s stories on there as yet). It&#8217;s been going for years and has tons of pop culture analysis. <strong>Our picks:</strong> <a href="http://www.thebody.com/content/art61152.html">&#8216;I Agree, We Are Not A F***ing Scorpion&#8217;</a>, <a href="http://www.thebody.com/content/63938/hivaids-and-latinas-what-does-gender-have-to-do-wi.html">&#8216;HIV, AIDS and Latinas: What Does Gender Have To Do With It?&#8217;</a>, <a href="http://www.thebody.com/content/art58907.html">&#8216;The Trials of Transition&#8217;</a>, and <a href="http://www.thebody.com/content/art58093.html">&#8216;Wanted: Feminist Warriors To Fight HIV and AIDS&#8217;</a>,</li>
<li><a href="http://www.poz.com/"><strong>The Poz</strong></a>: like The Body, this magazine is also a giant resource with tons of interesting <a href="http://blogs.poz.com/">blogs</a>. <strong>Our picks:</strong> <a href="http://blogs.poz.com/staff/archives/2011/09/game_down_low_aids.html">&#8216;Game, the Down-Low and AIDS&#8217;</a> and <a href="http://blogs.poz.com/aundarayguess/">&#8216;Wearing The Red Ribbon&#8217;</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter: <a href="http://twitter.com/nat_aids_trust">@NAT_AIDS_Trust</a></strong> (they run HIVAware) are enthusiastic, friendly, ready to engage with and @-reply to as many people as they can and eager to arm you with facts and stories from around the UK. Through them, we found <strong>UKPositiveLad</strong>: diagnosed a few months ago at 25, he&#8217;s <a href="http://twitter.com/UKPositiveLad">tweeting</a> his experiences, and <a href="http://ukpositivelad.wordpress.com/2011/11/30/my-first-world-aids-day/">blogging them too</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.queertransmen.org/index.php"><strong>QueerTransMen:</strong></a> a Canada-based sexual health site for queer trans* men with <a href="http://www.queertransmen.org/index.php?option=com_content&#038;task=view&#038;id=22&#038;Itemid=2">research</a>, <a href="http://www.queertransmen.org/index.php?option=com_content&#038;task=view&#038;id=14&#038;Itemid=29&#038;limit=1&#038;limitstart=2">mythbusting</a> and <strong>Primed</strong>, a sexual health guide written by and for. <strong><em>Not worksafe!</em></strong></li>
<li><a href="http://girllikeme.org/"><strong>A Girl Like Me</strong></a>: this is a resource &#8220;where women of all ages can share their stories and promote understanding of HIV through online storytelling&#8221;. It hasn&#8217;t been very active recently, and in many ways it&#8217;s not as &#8216;off the ground&#8217; as it could be&#8230; but we think it&#8217;s a great idea anyway.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.womankind.org.uk/"><strong>Womankind Worldwide</strong></a>: one of their areas of work is around supporting effective responses to HIV in women around the world. <strong>Our picks: </strong> <a href="http://www.womankind.org.uk/2011/12/world-aids-day-2011/">World AIDS Day 2011 post</a>, <a href="http://www.womankind.org.uk/2011/10/i-was-so-glad/">&#8216;I was so glad of how interested people were of what is happening in Ghana&#8217;</a>, and <a href="http://www.womankind.org.uk/2011/05/the-long-walk-home-how-hiv-infected-women-in-ghana-seeking-support-will-go-to-any-lengths-to-avoid-exposure/">&#8216;The Long Walk Home&#8217;</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, hey. You have all this stuff at your fingertips! Connect. Discover. Find stuff out. What&#8217;s the point of being on a feminist pop culture adventure if you don&#8217;t, you know, go forth and read? Exactly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday we posted Part 1 of our interview with anti-cuts activist Roxanne, who told us some pretty unsettling stuff about her experience of being arrested &#8211; <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/10/04/take-it-to-the-bridge-beyond-the-rage-of-the-girl-rioters-part-12">read it here</a>. </p>
<p>On with Part 2, then. </p>
<p><strong>Let&#8217;s talk about UK Uncut as a movement. Do you reckon it&#8217;s pretty equally gender split, and if so, do you reckon acting as a collective helps achieve this more effectively?</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn’t feel confident commenting on the gender split in UK Uncut &#8211; I&#8217;d be referring to tens of thousands of people across the UK. However, in terms of active groups working within the UK, the majority are dominated by white males. But this is why we need to be talking about cuts in terms of gender: to encourage women to join the frontline.</p>

However, it is still true that certain vulnerable groups within society are to be hit in ways that the more privileged may not be. Disabled people are losing their Disability Living Allowance, poorer students have lost the EMA that they and their families rely on, and some women will no longer be able to work because they now have to care for elderly family members or young children. I strongly believe that highlighting the different ways in which the cuts fall should spur people into action, on behalf of themselves or those less able, instead of acting in some divisive way. So what if today we’re standing up against cuts to childcare and you don’t have or want children &#8211; don’t you want to protect those in society who do? </p>
<p>&#8220;These aren’t just issues for women, because protecting women and vulnerable groups is in the interest of the whole of society.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Have you found any women&#8217;s protest movements around the world or in history particularly inspiring?</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;There are so many instances of women’s protest that inspire me consistently. At the moment I’ve been reading about the experiences of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assata_Shakur">Assata Shakur</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Davis">Angela Davis</a>, and find myself inspired by their unrelenting power (and their incredible writing!). </p>
<p>&#8220;I am inspired by the endurance of the women at <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/09/08/revolting-women-greenham-common/">Greenham Common</a>, and the physical strength of the four women who <a href="http://www.cultureshop.org/details.php?code=SEEDS">destroyed a Hawk fighter jet with hammers</a> that was being sold by the British government to East Timor to be used in the government’s illegal occupation of the country. I also recall an image of a row of Zapatista women standing in line with their faces covered but still wearing these incredible bright dresses &#8211; and that image alone inspires me. But closer to home, I am inspired by the women close to me and the support we provide for each other.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>What would your advice be to young women reading our blog who are concerned about the impact of the cuts? Maybe they&#8217;ve never been on a protest before. Perhaps they&#8217;re even a little nervous to start &#8211; do &#8220;clicktivism&#8221; and hashtags and so on make a difference in themselves?</strong></p>

But my advice to anyone nervous to get involved would be that anything that is worth fighting for is going to be a little scary, so that’s even more reason to give it a go. It’s scary because there is so much at stake. The kind of action UK Uncut takes is a great way to get involved. It’s fun and creative and there is always space for people to choose their own style of action, and meet other people who share the same views.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although other types of protest can be effective, I believe that direct action is necessary in any situation where other avenues have been exhausted and shut down. And that is the situation we are in now. For example, the reforms the NHS is facing weren’t in the Conservative or the Lib Dem manifesto, and this coalition government is not even acting on behalf of the majority vote. So how is it fair that these radical changes are being made to a health service that Britain should be so proud of achieving, but is instead determined to destroy, without a say from the public who use it? </p>
<p>&#8220;The leaders in charge of pushing through the bill do not have the population’s interests at heart, are not interested in what we want or what we have to say. But this is our NHS &#8211; we rely on it, and we must protect it.&#8221; </p>
<p><strong>Is it hard for protesters to keep momentum going in the face of these cuts? What&#8217;s next for you? </strong></p>
<p>&#8220;The groups organising actions every week across the country keep momentum going. This issue isn’t going away, the cuts are already being felt, and the fight against them will continue.</p>
<p>&#8220;UK Uncut have just announced the next day of mass action, called <a href="http://www.ukuncut.org.uk/blog/block-the-bridge-block-the-bill"><strong>‘Block the Bridge, Block the Bill’</strong></a> &#8211; 2000 people are already attending on the Facebook event, and hopefully will be showing how serious they are about not losing their National Health Service by transforming Westminster Bridge into hospitals, medical lectures, and a space to share stories about the NHS. </p>
<p>&#8220;On October 12th, the Lords have one last chance to amend the Health and Social Care Bill in Parliament before it is voted on again, and we have one last chance to show that we won’t lose our health service. So join UK Uncut on October 9th and take part in the fight against the cuts!&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So. March For The Alternative hit Manchester&#8217;s Tory Party Conference last weekend, and this weekend there&#8217;s more direct action on the way.</p>
<p>In the era of headlines like <em>RAGE OF THE GIRL RIOTERS</em>, what&#8217;s it like for women on the front line of anti-cuts protesting in the UK right now? Roxanne was at that first sit-in at the London Vodafone flagship store on 27 October 2010 &#8211; out of which <a href="http://www.ukuncut.org.uk/about/ukuncut">a nucleus of energy exploded</a> into the movement we now call <strong>UK Uncut</strong>. </p>

What do you think is the struggle for women in terms of the impact of these cuts? Obviously &#8220;women&#8221; aren&#8217;t a monolithic or homogenous group, but is there a distinct fight?</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;The full scale of the public sector cuts <a href="http://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/index.asp?PageID=1195">fall in a way that is unbalanced in terms of gender</a>. Women make up most of the public sector jobs being cut, women rely most heavily on public services and on certain benefits that are being cut, and where vulnerable people like children, the disabled and the elderly are stripped of their governmental support, it has historically been women that step in to bridge the gap and become carers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The cuts attack services that women depend on in order to live ‘equally’ with men, services that are there to compensate for existing gender inequalities &#8211; Rape Crisis centres and helplines, SureStart and childcare benefits. These are not privileges. Many women rely on these services. Without them, the progress that past generations have made by fighting to get us this far is being unnecessarily sacrificed. The cuts will push us back in time in terms of women’s rights and equality.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don’t believe the struggle is distinct &#8211; this is a fight that everyone should be fighting &#8211; but we should be aware of what we are fighting for and what we, as women, truly stand to lose. The message out there is not clear enough yet – as these cuts fall, they will cut through the progress women have made. </p>
<p>&#8220;The problem is, because of existing sexism within our society and a scepticism towards ‘feminism’, it is still so hard to have conversations about women and the inequality we struggle with. I believe we need more and more great acts of exciting and inviting civil disobedience to get people thinking seriously about gender and the cuts.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Have you found that the police and the media have treated you differently as a female protestor?</strong></p>

Of course. In the most extreme sense, my personal experience of being arrested was interesting in terms of my treatment as a woman. The fact that I am young and female was repeatedly used against me, as a way to make me feel inferior. Of course, that&#8217;s often what the police aim to do with any arrestee; to intimidate and isolate. But after talking to male activists, it seems to me that the treatment is often different if you are a woman in custody. </p>
<p>&#8220;I was arrested by a woman. She commented frequently on my appearance, asking things like, “Do you never brush your hair?” and when I was asked if this was my natural hair colour, she pulled at my roots and answered on my behalf, “No.” A friend of mine was arrested at the same time, and the woman arresting her was even worse. She searched through her backpack, pulled out a pair of underwear and pulled a face like she was disgusted to be holding them. She stretched them out and waved them in the faces of the male officers around, who seemed genuinely embarrassed and uncomfortable at the treatment this woman was giving my friend.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn’t any better when I was in the cell. I was not allowed to use my own tampon, and when I asked for a new one I was told the police station didn’t keep any. I was then given one hours later, which I had to use until I was released after 24 hours. Why don’t police stations have to stock tampons? They have to go out any buy you food if you have special requirements. I was also told I had to be watched closely as I inserted the tampon, which I later found out did not happen to other female activists in different stations. Taking away human rights as basic as this seems like just one more way to reduce an arrestee to a more helpless and regretful position.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>So how did this all get started for you, and is anti-cuts action your first foray into public protest?</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I was involved in environmental activism before UK Uncut, and that is where I learned about the use of direct action as a political tactic. I also learned how to use the consensus model of decision making which empowers each individual to have their say and play an equal part in the movement. These skills have been invaluable to me in every action I have been involved in. </p>
<p>&#8220;I felt that I had to do something to try and stop the government cutting the services that I am most proud of, that society’s most vulnerable people rely on to live in this country. I used to be proud of the structures we had built here to support our population- we built the NHS when we had a bigger deficit than we have today. We should all be proud of such universal services, and we shouldn’t give up the fight and watch as they are all sold off to profit-making companies.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Come back tomorrow for part 2 &#8211; more from Rox, why Block The Bridge should be your next demo, and how to get involved with protesting the cuts. Thanks to Rox for giving us her time.</em></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Argentina, during the period from 1976-1983, was not a good place to look even remotely like a dissident.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This post is part of a series on the theme of women and protest. The full series is collected <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/tag/revolting-women/">under the tag &#8220;Revolting Women&#8221;</a>.</em></p>
<p>Argentina, during the period from 1976-1983, was not a good place to look even remotely like a dissident. The era, known as the ‘<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_War">Dirty War</a>’, saw widespread violence carried out by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Rafael_Videla">Jorge Rafael Videla’s</a> military <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_junta">junta</a> against those it perceived as enemies of the state – students, journalists, trade unionists and Peronist guerillas (see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_of_the_Pencils">Night of the Pencils</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezeiza_massacre">Ezeiza Massacre</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margarita_Bel%C3%A9n_Massacre">Margarita Belén Massacre</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_flights">Luis Mendia’s death flights</a> for examples). Assaults, assassinations and kidnappings were rife, and somewhere between 9,000 and 30,000 people were forcibly disappeared, leaving no official trace of their fates.</p>
<p>This set the stage for the formation of a group known as the <strong>Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo</strong>, named for the plaza in central Buenos Aires where they first gathered. The Mothers are one of the more interesting protest movements of the late 20th century, and also a bunch of remarkable badasses. </p>
<p>Formed in 1977, the Mothers set out to pressure the government into admitting the fates of their disappeared children, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desaparecidos">Desaparecidos</a>. On the 30th of April that year sixteen women gathered outside the presidential palace to stage a demonstration, demanding to know what had happened to theirs sons and daughters. Consider that this was right in the middle of the Dirty War, when state-sponsored death squads were meting out harsh discipline pretty much with impunity. How staggeringly brave and determined do you have to be, at a time like that, to march up to the presidential palace and demand answers? This isn’t a movement that formed years later, in safety under a civilian government – they stood up to the military junta right from the start, despite the risks.</p>

<p>In a time when the government sought to isolate individuals, to separate and control people through application of terror, the Mothers gave a unified voice. They acted publicly, sharing their stories, gathering others to their cause. It was by no means a safe or easy course of  action (fully one quarter of the founding Mothers were also disappeared before the junta left power in 1983), but they managed to grow a movement that is still going.</p>
<blockquote><p>The ongoing work of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo has not gone on unnoticed. It has earned them international awards from bodies such as UNESCO and the European Parliament. It has also been met with harassment and repression. Three of the organization’s founding members have joined the ranks of the disappeared since its work began.</p>
<p>– <strong><a href="http://www.labournet.net/world/0001/mum1.html">Bruce Allen</a></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Since the fall of the junta and the return to civilian government, the pressure exerted by the Mothers has resulted in several hundred of the missing being identified, or their remains found. Many younger children turned out to have been given to adoptive loyalist families, and the Mothers have acted as intermediaries to help these children come to terms with their pasts and interact with both their adoptive and birth families.</p>
<p>Beyond just finding the missing, many of the Mothers have seen it as their duty to carry on the dreams of their children, to live for the causes that got them taken in the first place. To this end the group has grown to encompass other political causes, including the founding of a university, libraries and bookshops, and the provision of healthcare subsidies.</p>
<p>What makes the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo particularly interesting is the boundary-crossing nature of their protest. A lot of activist movements and protest campaigns become unfortunately mired in divisions, locking out valuable voices (see the refusal by key female American activists to accept the black suffrage movement in the early 20th century, or the frequent erasure of trans* and non-white issues among a lot of modern groups). The Mothers, by contrast, brought together several spheres of Argentinean culture. </p>

<p>Active in the central business areas of Buenos Aires, and by all accounts an urban movement, they nevertheless counted many rural Argentinians amongst their number. Age divides were crossed too, with a Grandmothers division of the group who continued the work of their kidnapped children, and looked after the offspring of disappeared Mothers.</p>
<p>Following the return to civilian government in 1983, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_of_the_Juntas">Trial of the Juntas</a> in ’85, the Mothers went international. Argentina hadn’t been the only South American country to disappear dissidents during that time (see: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Condor">Operation Condor</a>), and the Mothers sought to bring international pressure down on countries that still hadn’t come clean about their activities, particularly the Pinochet regime in Chile.</p>
<blockquote><p>
“One of the most beautiful things that came out of my work with the Grandmothers was learning that there was so much interest and solidarity from people in other parts of the world. It was an extraordinarily positive experience. We have had support from the women’s movement, from the CHA [Comité Homosexual Argentino], and from the transsexual groups.” </p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>Nélida de Navajas</strong>, quoted in Rita Arditti&#8217;s <strong>Searching for Life</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The Mothers are still active today, still working for answers about the fates of the thousands who remain unaccounted for, and still promoting the ideals and social changes their children were kidnapped for. They still march through the Plaza de Mayo every Thursday, in addition to a larger annual March of Resistance. </p>

<p>(<strong>Note:</strong> This post is primarily concerned with the Founding Line branch of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo. The Association faction, who split off in 1986, are more radical in their politics. They also do some very good work, but have publicly expressed some views that are difficult to endorse.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Partway through the <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/category/history-is-awesome/unsung-heroes-history-is-awesome/">Unsung Heroes</a> series, it seems like a good time to stop for a brief interlude and a slight shift in focus. <div id="attachment_4682" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/mirror.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4682" data-attachment-id="4682" data-permalink="/2011/04/05/unsung-heroes-interlude/mirror/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/mirror.jpg?fit=500%2C375&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="500,375" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="mirror" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/mirror.jpg?fit=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/mirror.jpg?fit=500%2C375&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/mirror-300x225.jpg?resize=300%2C225" alt="photo showing a red plastic hand mirror with a cream tassel on the handle.

(photo via Flickr, taken by user Jessica E Sideways. Shared under a Creative Commons license.)</p></div>You see, so far this collection of posts has centred on exceptional individuals who’ve done unique things and make for fascinating stories. However, whilst it’s great to give these figures the attention they deserve, and maybe to take some inspiration from their stories, the flow of events rarely rests on the actions of just one person. Lasting change is brought about by the ongoing work of countless people fighting for it on a daily basis.</p>
<p>This post, then, is about those people; people who are getting on with the everyday business of making change happen. That ranges from people who work in charities, NGOs, and support organisations; people who lobby and campaign; and people who are acting on the change they’d like to see in their interactions with the people around them.</p>
<p>So here, then, are just some of the many organisations run by awesome people, doing awesome things on a daily basis.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.africanfeministforum.com/">African Feminist Forum</a> – They run biennial conferences for feminist activists in Africa, and make efforts to include the voices of groups often marginalised within African feminism (and arguably feminist movements in many countries) – commercial sex workers, women with disabilities, and bisexual rights activists.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.cawn.org/">Central American Women’s Network</a> – They’re working to improve the political, social and cultural rights of women in Central America through advocacy and campaigning, and raising awareness in the UK and US. Freedoms in Honduras have been a particular issue since the coup d’etat of 2009.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.wbg.org.uk/">Women’s Budget Group</a>  &#8211; Based in the UK, they&#8217;re bringing gender analysis to economic policy, because it’s hard to work for an equal society when the vast impact of government expenditure is skewed in favour of one portion of the population.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.bihr.org.uk/">British Insitute of Human Rights</a> – Because human rights for everyone is very much a feminist issue, and the BIHR are one of several fantastic groups supporting that. (See also: <a href="http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/index.php">Liberty</a>, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org.uk/">Amnesty International</a>)
	</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rota.org.uk/pages/default.aspx">Race On The Agenda</a> – Too often the history of feminist discussion has been marred by an unfortunate exclusion of the voices from often-marginalised groups such as the Black and Asian communities. ROTA are one of the organisations helping to keep things more inclusive.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.thepowerhouse.org.uk/Powersite/sitemap.htm">Powerhouse</a> – Women with disabilities are another group that’s been too often pushed to one side or rendered invisible. Run &#8220;by and for women with learning disabilities&#8221;, Powerhouse bring focus to this.
</li>
<li><a href="http://feministlibrary.co.uk/">The Feminist Library</a> – Libraries are basically the most awesome things ever, and this one carries a huge stock of feminist literature. It should hardly need explaining why this is an entire industrial-sized vat of pure brilliance.</li>
<li>
The Survivor Project – I want to include these folk, because judging from what I&#8217;ve read they’re awesome, but unfortunately they seem to be without a website currently, so, er, you&#8217;ll have to find them yourselves later. They’re a non-profit working against domestic and sexual violence against anyone, but with a particular focus on trans* and intersex survivors. It’s an issue that’s all too often ignored in the mainstream. (If in the future a website becomes available, hopefully we&#8217;ll be able to draw attention to it.)</li>
</ul>
<p>This list isn’t even remotely exhaustive, and couldn’t possibly hope to be. There are more people out there working to support good ideas than I have any chance of adequately enumerating here. The fact that I can only post a tiny, miniscule example of some of the many groups and organisations involved in this is, honestly, brilliant. It’d be a worrying sign if every beneficial organisation could be summed up in the space of one post. For more comprehensive overviews of the groups out there though, do check the members list for the <a href="http://www.wrc.org.uk/membership/members_listing/default.aspx">Women’s Resource Centre</a> and the <a href="http://www.nawo.org.uk/id6.html">National Alliance of Women’s Organisations</a>. (Of course, that only covers groups based at least partially in the UK. The list gets even longer when we go global.)</p>
<p>And then of course there’s the fact that the above list has only covered organisations, groups, and charities. We’ve yet to even touch on the vast array of feminist bloggers, writers, artists, and others out there making their ideas visible. Or the yet wider group who don’t have a public podium from which to spread their message but are engaged in thinking about, discussing and living with this as a part of their daily world view. </p>
<p>What I’m saying is that there’s a lot of us, and the collective weight behind this set of ideas is formidable. And that’s seven shades of kickass.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Today is World Down Syndrome Day 2011.  I don't know how much you know about Down Syndrome as an individual reader.  Go and find out more about it. Finding stuff out is cool.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello, BadRep.</p>
<p>Today is <a href="http://www.worlddownsyndromeday.org/">World Down Syndrome Day 2011</a>.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how much you know about <a href="http://www.downs-syndrome.org.uk/">Down Syndrome</a> as an individual reader.  Don&#8217;t know much about it? Go and find out more about it. Think you know about it? Take some time to read and listen a bit more. Don&#8217;t be the person who scrolls on, eh? </p>
<p>I learned about Down Syndrome Day because I have a younger sister with Down Syndrome whom I lived with for sixteen years (I only moved out about two years ago) and so my family have lifetime membership of the Down Syndrome Association.  I&#8217;d like everyone to know about it, though.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to tell you a great deal about my family here because this is a short post &#8211; and because I haven&#8217;t asked what my sister thinks either about blogging on here, or being blogged about, yet, and not to do so would be at the least a bit cheeky. And also missing the point massively, in that &#8220;raising awareness&#8221; doesn&#8217;t mean I (an able-bodied person) get to trot out my non-consenting family on the internet in the name of Issues, or decide that <em>me</em> posting is better than actually getting they themselves on here to speak.  </p>
<p>But here are some things to look at and read:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://disabledfeminists.com/2010/11/17/disability-is-a-feminist-issue-gendering-health-access/">Why disability is a feminist issue</a></strong>, from Feminists With Disabilities for a Way Forward.  It&#8217;s a US-based perspective, but really, you should read it. Edit: <a href="http://disabledfeminists.com/2009/10/14/disability-is-a-feminist-issue/">this post too</a>.
</li>
<li>
A <a href="http://blog.thearc.org/2010/11/19/i-am-not-a-disability-eliza-schaaf/">recent case of <strong>completely shitty education-based discrimination</strong></a> against a young woman with Down Syndrome. The words of her parents on this one struck a depressingly familiar chord with mine. They&#8217;ve had to navigate this sort of bullshit far too often, too.</li>
<li>Mencap: <a href="http://www.mencap.org.uk/landing.asp?id=1683">find out more about what a learning disability is</a>. Over 1.5 million people in the UK have a learning disability, so if you really care about activism and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersectionality">intersectionality</a> of any kind, it&#8217;s worth your time. Seriously.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Will you let us in? </strong>A five minute film, covering 45 countries.<br />
<iframe title="YouTube video player" width="560" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/tLx0rl2sCzM?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Read, think, share links around, and have a good week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/03/02/reproductive-justice-in-the-uk-part-1"><em>Read Part 1 of this article here</em></a></strong></p>
<p>I asked some leading UK pro-choice campaigners whether the US reproductive justice approach introduced in Part 1 is relevant to their work, and what &#8211; if anything &#8211; might be gained from creating a similar movement in Britain.</p>
<p><strong>Shaming black women</strong></p>
<p>Black British women are, according to Department of Health statistics, more likely to have an abortion than their white counterparts (<a title="Department of Health statistics" href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsStatistics/DH_099285">source</a>).  On the other side of the Atlantic there has been some especially poisonous anti-choice campaigning based around a similar difference. Georgia Right to Life posted 80 billboards around the city of Atlanta proclaiming “Black people are an endangered species”, with a website address: toomanyaborted.com. Loretta Ross, National Co-ordinator of <a href="http://www.sistersong.net/">SisterSong</a>, described it as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a misogynistic attack to shame-and-blame black women who choose abortion, alleging that we endanger the future of our children… Our opponents used a social responsibility frame to claim that black women have a racial obligation to have more babies – especially black male babies &#8212; despite our individual circumstances.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alarmingly, the UK anti-choice movement has already begun to adopt some of the US campaigning messages about the &#8216;black genocide&#8217;. Lisa Hallgarten, Director of <strong><a title="Education for Choice" href="http://www.efc.org.uk">Education for Choice</a></strong>, reported that “the Marie Stopes International clinic in Brixton is routinely picketed by antis who claim that MSI is trying to kill black babies. I have seen leaflets that claim that Brook is a eugenic organisation.” This is just the latest trend in a pattern of UK anti-choicers adopting US campaigning tactics.<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/efc_twitterskin4.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="1381" data-permalink="/2010/12/01/fighting-for-the-facts-about-abortion/efc_twitterskin4/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/efc_twitterskin4.jpg?fit=191%2C95&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="191,95" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="EFC Logo" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/efc_twitterskin4.jpg?fit=191%2C95&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/efc_twitterskin4.jpg?fit=191%2C95&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1381" style="margin: 10px;" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/efc_twitterskin4.jpg?resize=191%2C95" alt="Education for Choice Logo" width="191" height="95" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Reproductive rights</strong></p>
<p>I wanted to know whether the broader ‘reproductive rights’ approach had been adopted in the UK at all, by which I mean looking at contraception, sex education, adoption and the socioeconomic factors which impact on women’s decisions about whether or not to have children <em>alongside</em> calling for the right to safe, legal abortion.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/991.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="3658" data-permalink="/2011/03/03/reproductive-justice-in-the-uk-part-2/attachment/991/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/991.jpg?fit=209%2C96&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="209,96" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Abortion Rights banner" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/991.jpg?fit=209%2C96&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/991.jpg?fit=209%2C96&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3658" style="margin: 10px;" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/991.jpg?resize=209%2C96" alt="Photo showing bright pink and white Abortion Rights banner being carried at an outdoor event with a pink balloon floating in the foreground" width="209" height="96" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Darinka Aleksic, <strong><a title="Abortion Rights" href="http://www.abortionrights.org.uk/">Abortion Rights</a></strong> Campaign Co-ordinator, said that “because British women do not experience the extremes of health inequalities on ethnic or economic grounds that women in the US do (although I’m not minimizing those that exist), the repro rights approach has not, in my opinion, been quite so vital or so relevant to our situation.”</p>
<p>Lisa agreed that a rights-based approach hasn’t been widely adopted: “Since UK policy can be made or broken by the Daily Mail it is hard to take an abstract political or human rights approach to these things”. But she was clear on some of the problems with the existing situation, including the emphasis on abortion as a medical issue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The public health approach is fundamentally limited and limiting because it relies on scientific evidence supporting the role of abortion in public health. For me there is a point where personal autonomy may trump public health and we should always keep our commitment to autonomy at the forefront of discussion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the absence of universal high quality sex education:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lack of sex education is a clear obstacle not just to the people who are young at that point in time, but to society getting better at talking about sex. I think, realistically, that some fundamental work needs to be done on coming to terms with human sexuality as a society before anyone will have the courage or funding to stand up in government and take a reproductive justice approach to these things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Abortion rights and social justice</strong></p>
<p>Finally I asked Lisa and Darinka if it would be helpful to put the campaign to protect and extend abortion rights in the UK in a wider context of social justice, and whether there was a risk of losing support in the medical establishment if it came to be seen as a campaigning issue rather than a question of health policy.</p>
<p>Lisa said that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our whole law was put in place to medicalise the procedure, put it under doctors&#8217; control and protect doctors. I think there is a big danger of losing their support if they don&#8217;t feel ownership of it.</p>
<p>However, the greater danger is that we don&#8217;t have a broad grassroots movement to protect abortion rights in this country. If we built a reproductive justice movement we would have a much more broad-based constituency to come out fighting when our rights are up for grabs in the Commons.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Darinka explained that &#8220;Abortion Rights’ primary role is to defend the 1967 Abortion Act.&#8221; But also that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As an organization that has strong links to the trade union movement, we are inclined to stress the importance of abortion access as an economic issue. It has always been working class women who have suffered from a lack of access to safe, legal abortion.</p>
<p>Public service and spending cuts are going to hit women hardest and the reorganization of the NHS raises real questions about how access to abortion and contraception services will be maintained. So we are campaigning against the cuts alongside other organizations on a broader social justice basis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Reproductive justice for the UK?</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>After talking to Mara, Lisa and Darinka it became clear that there are opportunities for the UK pro-choice movement in the reproductive justice approach, although simply importing the US model wouldn’t work. In Britain public and medical establishment support for the right to choose is far greater, there are fewer differences in access to healthcare along lines of race or sexual orientation, and there is more state support for families.</p>
<p>However, the British sexual and reproductive health landscape is shifting. While the usual attacks on the Abortion Act are being launched in Westminster (and <a href="http://www.abortionrights.org.uk/">Abortion Rights</a> tirelessly resists them) a few more developments have been added to the mix over the last year &#8211; including controversy around the sterilisation of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-11545519">drug addicts</a> and those with severe <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2011/feb/15/forced-sterilisation-mother-court-plea">learning disabilities</a>, the end of the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-11541423">Teenage Pregnancy Strategy</a>, mass popular protests against the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11355258">Pope’s visit</a>, the crisis in <a href="http://www.midirs.org/development/midwiferyweb.nsf/z45/78260C15C81B48088025783A004C6726?opendocument&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=facebook">midwifery</a>, and health professionals calling out <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/feb/09/channel-4-the-joy-of-teen-sex">shoddy sex education</a> in the media.</p>
<p>While there are a whole range of fantastic organizations working variously to defend and extend abortion rights and access, to improve sex education and sexual health, to support families and advance LGBT and women’s rights, to fight racism and inequalities in access to or influence on public services, this work doesn’t take place under a shared banner of Reproductive Justice.</p>
<p>I am a campaigner; I understand the need to choose your battles and your targets carefully. But as the ideological reforms of what is essentially a Tory government start to bite, I wonder if the battle may be coming to us. Perhaps it’s time to build a movement and raise the flag.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ll come clean: I missed most of Ladyfest Ten. And I missed it because I was hungover, on about a thimbleful of wine. But one of the things I did actually manage to see that weekend was the excellent US pro-choice documentary <strong><a href="http://www.thecoathangerproject.com/">The Coat Hanger Project</a></strong>, at a screening organized by <strong><a href="http://www.efc.org.uk/">Education for Choice</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the film there was a section about the ‘reproductive justice’ movement. The interviews intrigued me. It looked exciting, radical, inclusive and even kinda fun. The film featured an endearing group of smart, funny, young activists that reminded me of the<strong> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpQSJjK_ENg">Itty Bitty Titty Committee</a></strong>, which is no bad thing in my book. After a few aspirin I was inspired to find out more…</p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3>What is reproductive justice?<strong> </strong></h3>
<p>Reproductive justice is a holistic, inclusive and intersectional campaign for reproductive rights and the conditions necessary for women to realize them. It is a movement led by women of colour, which addresses the right to have children as well as the right not to have children, expanding the focus out from abortion to include wider questions of sex education, sexuality, birth control and the impact of poverty and violence.  This video is a good introduction: <strong><a href="http://vimeo.com/10604537">What is Reproductive Justice?</a></strong></p>
<p>And here it is on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_justice">Wikipedia</a> for good measure.</p>
<p>I had a quick look online for UK reproductive justice groups or networks, but couldn’t find anything, although the US movement has been around since the 1990s. Of course it’s different terrain &#8211; here’s an <a href="http://www.thefword.org.uk/blog/2010/04/working_in_abortion_education_and_outreach_in_the_uk_and_the_us_whats_the_diff">F Word post</a> about some of the differences between the US and UK around abortion and sex education &#8211; but is the reproductive justice approach relevant to the UK at all?</p>
<h3>Realising reproductive rights</h3>
<p>A key aspect of the reproductive justice approach is integrating pro-choice activism into a wider social justice movement. This is from <strong><a href="http://www.sistersong.net/">SisterSong</a></strong>’s document ‘Understanding Reproductive Justice’:</p>
<blockquote><p>Abortion isolated from other social justice/human rights issues neglects issues of economic justice, the environment, immigrants’ rights, disability rights, discrimination based on race and sexual orientation, and a host of other community-centered concerns directly affecting an individual woman’s decision making process.</p>
<p>By shifting the definition of the problem to one of reproductive oppression (the control and exploitation of women, girls, and individuals through our bodies, sexuality, labor, and reproduction) rather than a narrow focus on protecting the legal right to abortion, we are developing a more inclusive vision of how to move forward in building a new movement.</p></blockquote>
<p>While defending the rights we are lucky enough to have protected by law is vital, the rights become meaningless if people can’t access them, and in many areas social and cultural change and economic equality are needed for people to realise their rights.<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/asn-logo.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="3646" data-permalink="/2011/03/02/reproductive-justice-in-the-uk-part-1/asn-logo/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/asn-logo.jpg?fit=200%2C73&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="200,73" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Abortion Support Network logo" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/asn-logo.jpg?fit=200%2C73&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/asn-logo.jpg?fit=200%2C73&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-3646" style="margin: 10px;" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/asn-logo.jpg?resize=200%2C73" alt="Abortion Support Network logo featuring three grey/black interlinked &quot;female&quot; symbols" width="200" height="73" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>How might this be relevant to the UK pro-choice movement? Although abortion has been legal since 1967, and in theory it is freely available on the NHS, there are major inequalities in access. I spoke to Mara Clarke, founder of the <strong><a href="http://www.abortionsupport.org.uk/">Abortion Support Network</a></strong>, who explains some of the problems:</p>
<blockquote><p>Abortion is available on the NHS, but only if you obtain two doctors&#8217; signatures. This can be difficult if you live in an area with only one GP who is anti-abortion. Access to abortion services can be as much of a postcode lottery as any other service in the UK&#8230; This can make things more difficult for women as not only does the procedure become more invasive the further into pregnancy one gets, but not all clinics perform abortions up to the legal limit. This means some women opt to pay privately for abortions to avoid wait times, where other women have to wait until further in pregnancy and/or travel great distances to obtain the care they require.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks to investment and prioritisation by the previous government, things have improved: 94% of abortions are now funded by the NHS, and waiting times have been drastically reduced. However, these achievements, like many others, are likely to be lost as vicious spending cuts unravel years of positive work.</p>
<p>And in both Northern Ireland &#8211; despite being part of the UK &#8211; and the Republic of Ireland, abortion is illegal except under extremely restricted circumstances. So every year in order to access safe and legal abortion thousands of women are forced to travel to England and pay anywhere between £400 and £2,000 for the cost of the procedure, travel, childcare and time off work. <a title="Abortion Support Network" href="http://www.abortionsupport.org.uk">Abortion Support Network</a> works to help these women by providing financial assistance, information, a meal and a safe place to sleep, but they can’t meet the need on their own.</p>
<p>There’s also a major problem around lack of unbiased information and impartial support around sexual health and pregnancy choices for young people, especially about abortion. Many young women are effectively prevented from making an informed decision because they are misinformed at school, or receive biased advice from bogus counselling services. <a title="Education for Choice" href="http://www.efc.org.uk">Education for Choice</a> work to make sure young people have the facts, but they are a tiny organisation fighting a wealthy anti-choice movement.</p>
<h3>Abortion and race</h3>
<p>The reproductive justice movement particularly addresses the experiences and needs of women of colour around sexual health, parenthood, pregnancy and abortion. While there are not such large differences in access to healthcare by ethnicity in Britain as in the US, there are some patterns. For example, according to Department of Health stats, black British women are almost three times more likely to have an abortion than white women (<a title="Department of Health statistics" href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsStatistics/DH_099285" target="_self">source</a>).  It’s not clear why this is, but when I asked Darinka Aleksic, <a title="Abortion Rights" href="http://www.abortionrights.org.uk/content/view/247/1/">Abortion Rights</a> Campaign Co-ordinator, she suggested an economic explanation:</p>
<blockquote><p>The argument advanced in the US is that because minority ethnic women are more likely to experience poverty and economic disadvantage, the abortion rate among these communities is therefore higher. The Department of Health in England and Wales does not include income levels in its abortion statistics, but Scotland does, and their figures regularly show that abortion rates are higher in economically disadvantaged areas.</p></blockquote>
<p>As Darinka points out, there is a similar discrepancy in US abortion statistics, and there’s more in Part 2 about how this is being used by the anti-choice movement in America and starting to be used by our own merry band of anti-choicers.</p>

<p>Twitter hashtags make conversations and exchanges that would previously have been invisible to anyone not involved in them available to everyone. You can stick your head out of your own online bubble and peer into someone else’s. If you listen in to a conversation on a bus or in a bar you’ll often get a similar effect, and if you ever share a train carriage with a stag party you may well overhear some of the same sentiments.</p>
<p>There are a lot of possibilities and interesting conversations growing out of this (here’s a good <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/10/14/twitter-cross-cultural/">Mashable post</a> about cross-cultural conversations) but it can be uncomfortable having a front row seat for the social reproduction of gender stereotypes in real time.</p>
<h3>Tweeting gender</h3>
<p>[Apologies to any gender theorists out there for this next bit, in which I will be oversimplifying some complex ideas.]</p>
<p>[Oh and just to be clear, when I&#8217;m talking about men and women I don&#8217;t mean <em>all</em> men or<em> all</em> women, and I know those categories are far more fluid than our friends the hashtaggers would like to admit.]</p>
<p>Part of the Great Promise of the internet was that in the gap between your avatar and your fingertips on the keyboard all kinds of subversive genderfuck fun was to be had. And it is being had (hooray!), but there’s a tangible disappointment in some areas that the web is used as much to police and reinforce gendered ideas of appropriate behaviour as it is to undermine them. Social networks, it turns out, are simply another arena in which to enact and consolidate gender identity. Like the bus, like the pub.</p>
<p>And a big part of successfully Being A Man or Being A Woman is policing the behaviour of others. By laying down the rules you’re letting everyone know you understand them. In fact you’re an expert. By calling out someone else on their inappropriate behaviour (for example, women that are ‘loud’ &#8211; how unfeminine!) you’re picking up gender points for yourself. And appropriate gender behaviour points <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=F7vd7JQ4zlcC&amp;pg=PA391&amp;lpg=PA391&amp;dq=appropriate+gender+behaviour+rewards&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oIgpBlhobo&amp;sig=FIG-3K8iC2TbO_Qb7Co11WKNNKY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=9WQ7TfrbFtOxhQfZ__zNCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">win prizes</a>!</p>
<p>You can see this in action in the huge numbers of women participating in sexist hashtags and imparting helpful advice to their own gender:</p>
<blockquote><p>#rulesforgirls stoppp being so easyyyy!</p>
<p>#ihatefemaleswho act like they in to sports</p>
<p>#agoodwoman sucks her mans dick w|. out no hesitation lOl.</p>
<p>#agoodwoman aims to please</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks for that. Now I&#8217;m all set. In another recent hashtag, #youneedanewboyfriend, large numbers of male and female Twitter users took the opportunity to remind everyone that male femininity = gay! Which as we all know = very bad indeed:</p>
<blockquote><p>
your man has more clothes with different shades of pink than you.#youneedanewboyfriend</p>
<p>If your man turns down sex from you, #youneedanewboyfriend</p>
<p>#youneedanewboyfriend If he knows all the words to every @ladygaga song out there #notnormal</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s not just about putting women in their place, it&#8217;s about keeping men in line as well. If you can do both that makes you the Manliest Man of all, and king of all you survey. The tweets I quoted in the first post are part of this process. On the one hand encouraging traditionally feminine behaviours, and on the other boosting the masculinity points of the men tweeting, and asserting their dominance and entitlement (consider yourself lucky if you missed #itaintrape – that one was Not Nice).</p>
<p>What I think is happening here is that a large number of people are using a new medium to do exactly what an even larger number of people have already been doing for centuries, millennia, even. What’s different is that the isolated conversations are being collected and shared on a global platform.</p>
<h3>What now?</h3>

<p>The flagrant misogyny of most of these trending topic  hashtag tweets makes me furiously angry. But I don&#8217;t find them shocking. I  think Germaine Greer is wrong on lots of things but right on this one:  “Women have very little idea of how much men hate them.” Well, now we have a handy index in our Twitter sidebar. The scale of the problem is intimidating, I agree, but being shocked  isn’t going to help.</p>
<p>The good news is we don&#8217;t need to start a cultural  revolution from scratch. There’s some excellent work already going  on: for example, <a href="http://www.womankind.org.uk/uk-schools.html">Womankind</a> and <a href="http://www.pinkstinks.co.uk/">PinkStinks</a> are challenging misogyny and sexist attitudes among young people (who seem like the obvious group to start with, to my mind).</p>
<p>There are also lots of truly wonderful online projects that are trying to break down some of these poisonous  stereotypes and ideas. BadRep is one, of course ;-) .  But another of my  favourites is <a href="http://genderfork.com/">Genderfork</a> – follow them on Twitter for the perfect antidote to all this #rulesforgirls/boys crap.</p>
<p>What else can we do? Mocking the hashtags is fun. Hijacking them is fun too. It might not overthrow the sexist idiot regime, but if it makes just one person stop and think then it&#8217;s surely worth it. Another blogger on the topic of hashtags suggested getting some  feminist hashtags circulating. Suggestions included #feminist and  #ilovemybody. That&#8217;d be nice for other feminists, but I can’t see how they’d have  very wide appeal, particularly because they don’t invite people to  personalise them.</p>
<p>So I’m going to end with a challenge: <strong>can we come up  with a funny, pro-feminist / genderfuck hashtag people might actually  use?</strong></p>
