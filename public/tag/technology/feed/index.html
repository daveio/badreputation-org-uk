										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Explain to me about supercars.</p>
<p>No, seriously. If anyone out there has a clue, please write in and explain to me how anyone can consider them ‘cool’. Now, I like a<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercar"> supercar</a> as much as the next person.  Wait, scratch that. How can I say I like it? I’ve never driven a supercar. I’ve never touched one. I’ve never even seen one in real life close up. (I will obviously have to make an effort at the next motorshow.) So how can I categorically state: yup, that one there, that’s the one for me, the one with the bright orange paintjob and the rotating guns mounted on the spoiler?</p>
<p>I realise <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/03/04/secret-diary-of-a-female-petrolhead-%E2%80%93the-water-cooler-test/">I’ve just finished telling you</a> that I am really quite partial to the <a href="http://www.paganiautomobili.it/zonda/zonda_R/default.aspx">Zonda R</a>, but that’s more of an abstract sort of love. I love it like I love Dali – I’ve no idea what’s going on with it, and would feel vaguely disturbed if I did. But to stand up and say, yup, I’d love to own one? No.</p>

<p>And yet, despite that, I’m having to wage battles over whether or not the <a href="http://www.lotuscars.com/en/lotus-exige">Exige</a> – or the <a href="http://www.koenigsegg.com/cars/agera/">Agera</a>, or the <a href="http://www.astonmartin.com/thecars/one77">One-77</a> – is cool, uncool or just too uncool for words. My logic, for anyone who is interested, is this: <em>if it looks like it’s something a City banker would drive without a hint of irony, there are no words for how uncool it is. </em>Give it up now.</p>
<p>Actually, I don’t see why I should be having this argument at all, because it’s my fridge, and my fridge magnets, and if I decide to have the Exige in the <a href="http://topgear.cloudapp.net/default.aspx">Uncool</a> section, on my own head be it. And still, out it came – “but look at it! It looks like the Batmobile!”</p>
<p>There is, I suspect, a significant difference between engine enthusiasts and car enthusiasts. Both care about what the car has under the bonnet, but the car enthusiasts also care about <a href="http://www.venomgt.com/gallery/x1-top-gear-magazine/">whether or not it looks like a Batmobile</a>. Whereas I actively gravitate towards non-Batmobile cars (they don’t go with my handbag).</p>
<p>Anyway, the point is, I’ve now had a few driving lessons, and have therefore been thinking about what car I would hypothetically buy once I pass my driving test (and before I move to my castle, complete with moat). Meanwhile, my instructor was telling me to stop giving way to people (why? They were busy and going somewhere, whereas I was driving in circles!) and hold my ground. I had to stop being so cooperative, otherwise I would be &#8216;forever taken advantage of&#8217;.</p>
<p>While I was thinking about being less cooperative, I was cut up by a bloke driving a royal blue Ferrari. I can’t swear as to the model, due to the extreme speed at which he almost ran me off the road, but its sloping front looked rather like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrari_Daytona">Ferrari Daytona</a>. Suffice to say I was rather surprised to see one in Clapham, and even more surprised to nearly have it embed itself in the side of the <a href="http://www.fiat.co.uk/showroom/?id=10023#showroom/new_500">Fiat 500</a> I was desperately trying not to stall.</p>
<p>Ah, I thought. <em>That</em> is what I’m supposed to do. That raw, unbridled aggre-</p>
<p>“Was that the same Ferrari I saw on the roundabout a few minutes ago?” my instructor asked. I wouldn’t know, since at the time I was trying to remember which turn I was meant to be taking. But if so &#8211;</p>
<p>“Why is that bloke driving around pointlessly?”</p>
<p>As several Very Busy Persons behind me decided to improve my driving skills by honking their horns and pointing out that I should have allowed the Daytona-alike and my little Fiat to merge rather than braking and therefore delaying them by 3.4 seconds, I pondered the problem of the supercar. Even a Ferrari seemed a little pointless in South London. Surely anyone who drove one would either have to buy their own corner of Monte Carlo, or would otherwise have to face running for a pint of milk in something that looks like it should ram other cars for daring to share road space.</p>

<p>I’m going to have to decline. I’d much rather drive something that didn’t automatically make people hate me from miles away.</p>
<p>I’ve settled on an Alfa 166. No, it&#8217;s not a supercar.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s better.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to X &amp; Y Communications, an agency (apparently) specialising in the impact of gender differences on business, <a title="Daily Telegraph: What Do Women Want From Cars" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/columnists/neil-lyndon/8294019/What-do-women-want-from-cars.html" target="_blank"> women ask themselves one fundamental question</a> when contemplating the  purchase of a car. Is it the price?, I hear you wonder. Is it the safety  rating, or the fuel efficiency?</p>
<p>No. It&#8217;s: <em>&#8220;Will it make me look hotter when I step out of it outside a bar or restaurant?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Yes, the main thing that will make a woman decide on a particular car is how &#8216;hot&#8217; she feels in it. <strong>Telegraph</strong><em> </em>writer  Neil Lyndon &#8211; bemoaning the fact that his wife&#8217;s friend opted  for a car she liked and he deemed useless &#8211; goes on to tell us all about the new  Citroën DS3, decorated by graphic artist <a title="Orla Kiely" href="http://www.orlakiely.com/uk/" target="_blank">Orla Kiely</a>.  Now you really will be able to match your car to your handbag. Isn&#8217;t  that snazzy, girls? All your tricksy car decisions solved by this one  simple, fashionable step!</p>

Image (c) CarsRoute.com</p></div>
<p>According to Lyndon, his wife&#8217;s divorced friend ignored all sensible, practical considerations when making her car choice, and simply went for a pretty French hatchback. Because that&#8217;s what women do, of course: we go for the pretty option despite it possibly being on fire.</p>
<p>The thing is &#8211; and this will come as no surprise to those familiar with his prior work &#8211; Lyndon is talking complete twaddle. According to AutoEbid.com&#8217;s <a title="AutoEbid.com's Help Me Choose a New Car" href="http://www.autoebid.com/help-me-choose.asp">Help Me Choose a New Car</a> function, you can choose from six factors when trying to find the perfect car for you. They are: Comfort, Styling, Handling, Depreciation, Economy, and Safety. The price is a liming criterion: the thing that helps you to narrow your choice, rather than the main principle of selection. In fact, unless you are going into the market with an extremely limited amount of money, the cost of the car will only ever help you to select a class, or possibly a financing option. Put it another way: no one will switch from a brand-new Fiat 500 to a second-hand Volvo XC90, even though both can be had for roughly £10k.</p>
<p>So how do people choose cars, then, if it&#8217;s not the price?</p>
<p>1. First and foremost, functionality. What are you going to use the car for? If you have five children that will need running to school every morning, you will probably end up with that Volvo. If, on the other hand, you&#8217;re looking for an urban runabout, something small and easy to park is probably better.</p>
<p>2. Up there as a consideration is styling: you want it to look good. In fact, certain TV shows have gone so far as to have an entire segment over whether <a title="The Cool Wall" href="http://topgear.cloudapp.net/default.aspx">a car is &#8216;cool&#8217; or not</a>. The guide there, by the way, is whether a cool person would drive it. Perhaps X &amp; Y Communications neglected to canvas the Top Gear audience in their research.</p>
<p>3. The last, all encompassing question is: I live with it? This includes things like reliability, fuel economy, ability to park it in London, whether the suspension will destroy your spine the first time you drive over road-humps.</p>
<p>The &#8216;price&#8217; question helps to narrow your options, and, on occasion, to disabuse you of the notion that you really could afford to buy a supercar if you sell the house and both kidneys.</p>
<p>The key question Lyndon ignored was what his wife&#8217;s friend wanted in a car: she wanted a cute little urban runabout that would cheer her up in the mornings. Put simply, she wanted that &#8216;new car&#8217; feeling: you&#8217;ve chosen well, your car looks good, and you love it more than it is natural to love an inanimate object. If she was a man lovingly polishing his vintage (decrepit) Rolls, Lyndon would have smiled indulgently.</p>
<p>What Lyndon is bemoaning is not women&#8217;s tendency to pick cars that  make them look good &#8211; we all do that. No one has ever looked at a car and thought, &#8220;sure, it&#8217;s beautiful, but given the choice I&#8217;d go for the ugly, uncomfortable one on the left.&#8221;  Our budgets and priorities may vary, but the  intent remains the same. You buy the thing that makes you feel happy  when you&#8217;re inside it. Lyndon seems to have forgotten that, or have  momentarily blanked out all car adverts, ever. It&#8217;s such an established  cliché that car makers can now produce meta-tastic pastiches of previous  ads and we lap it up. Check out this Volvo V60 &#8220;How to make a sexy car  advert&#8221; clip:</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/xKNsF7Cg2U4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>When you sell a lifestyle, of course you&#8217;re going to sell a cool,  stylish one. Only a fool would try to market a boring car for boring  people.</p>

<p>Of course, that&#8217;s really the thing Lyndon is taking an issue with. <em>He</em> wanted his wife&#8217;s friend to go away and make a list of her  requirements, and bring back the top three cars that fulfilled them. He  would then counsel her to make the reasoned, practical decision. <em>She</em> wanted to buy a cool hatchback following a messy divorce. The thing is,  women going through messy divorces are not meant to want cool  hatchbacks. They&#8217;re not meant to want anything funky or stylish. They  should be worried about making ends meet, and where the rent is coming  from, and how they&#8217;re going to get to work now that their ex-husband has custody of the car. No divorced woman should want to look or feel  attractive, and she certainly shouldn&#8217;t be be gallivanting around bars or restaurants. I could choose this point to make a catty comment about how  Lyndon left his wife for another woman, <a title="No More Sex War" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/More-Sex-War-Neil-Lyndon/dp/0749315652/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1298924959&amp;sr=8-2">published a book </a>railing against  the &#8220;universal dominance of feminism&#8221; and has since been struggling to  rebuild his career.</p>
<p>Lyndon&#8217;s article reveals nothing about gender or, indeed, about car choice (and I highly doubt the odious Mr Lyndon chose his  own car based on a set of requirements and flowcharts). All it shows us is how deep his prejudices still lie: a woman who is hard up and urgently needs a car should not, in Lyndon&#8217;s  world, get to make that sort of choice. Having asked his advice, she  should have acknowledged his superiority and allowed him to select one  for her. After all, her preference for a &#8220;chic little French-made hatchback&#8221;  instantly indicated to him that she must not have the know-how to do it  herself.</p>
<p>And as for the Citroën DS3, the target of Lyndon&#8217;s ire: well, it&#8217;s not doing too badly, despite Lyndon&#8217;s contempt. It&#8217;s just been named <strong>Top Gear Magazine</strong>&#8216;s <a title="Top Gear Magazine 2010 Car of the Year" href="http://www.topgear.com/uk/photos/the-2010-top-gear-awards?imageNo=1">2010 Car of the Year</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My model engine has arrived!</p>
<p>Let me tell you about it. It is a simplified, reasonably accurate version of a four-stroke engine, and it comes with its very own Haynes manual. It’s also entirely plastic and aimed at ages 10+. Bollocks, I say. If I had kids that age, I wouldn’t let them anywhere near the thing with their wickedly sharp craft knives. They&#8217;d have their fingers off before the first tea break.</p>

Like Airfix, only not.</p></div>
<p>Let me back up a bit. <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/02/17/secret-diary-of-a-female-petrolhead/">A few months ago, I decided that I was going to learn about engines.</a> I’ve always been a bit hazy on the theory behind internal combustion, and despite my father’s repeated attempts to explain, I’ve never really been able to get it straight in my head. This could have something to do with his insistence on explaining over the dinner table, rather than opening up the bonnet of his car and explaining there. (My brother got the lecture over the open bonnet of the car. <em>He</em> got so bored he fell asleep.)</p>
<p>This will all be a lot easier to grasp if I can actually do it myself. If I can take apart an engine and put it back together, you can be reasonably certain that I’ll know how it works afterwards. OK, maybe I’ll explode the back garden a couple of times, but I’ve accepted that as an inevitable consequence.</p>
<p>Miraculously, my new-found zeal is shared by a colleague of mine. She, too, wants to strip down an engine and see what makes it tick. Excellent! We ordered a plastic model to assemble in order to get a vague idea of what it will all involve, before thinking about taking things a little further. While we waited for the model to arrive, we may have become a little… unruly. Rowdy. Noisy. Obnoxious? Surely not!</p>
<p>After one of our exchanges, a colleague came up to me. She works in HR. You know the type: perfect hair, perfect nails, perfect smile. Was my enthusiasm too, er, enthusiastic?</p>
<p>“I just wanted to say, what you’re doing is fantastic,” she murmured quietly, and straightened the strand of pearls at her neck. “I love my car, I’d kill any fucker who so much as touched it. There’s nothing quite like a good engine purring, you know?”</p>
<p>I didn’t know, actually, but I nodded just the same.</p>
<p>The next day, another colleague was delivering some papers over my lunch hour when she saw the driving lessons website open in my browser. “Oh, are you learning to drive? Good for you! I learned in Nairobi, I thought I’d be quite frightened and sedate but it turned out I was a real girl racer, I nearly failed because I was speeding the entire time…”</p>
<p>I’m guessing that speeding will not be encouraged in London.</p>
<p>The next day, colleague Y came up to me, very upset, and drew me away from my desk. “I heard that you and colleague X are rebuilding an engine!” she said, looking very upset. Well, yes. Was this against her ethical beliefs? Was I in trouble with the ‘cycle to work’ initiative?</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you invite me?”</p>
<p>The thing is, I haven’t really mentioned this that much at work, despite being giddy with it for months. The people that have found out about it have either nodded sagely about how many times I&#8217;ll set myself on fire, or raved about how brilliant it all is. Invariably, my young female colleagues have fallen into the latter category. They’ve also taken the opportunity to ask me what I thought about the new Pagani (undecided, and I miss the Zonda R), the One-77 (I do like it, but why is it so angry? It looks like it’s been munching on stray pets) and plus, wouldn’t it be nice if the off-road vehicles didn’t kill your spine every time you went off road? (Seriously, Toyota, sort it out.) All of this was delivered in hushed tones over the tea and coffee, and by the time we were back at our desks we were very firmly back on either the Sudan referendum or the receptionist’s new hairstyle.</p>

<p>Why? Was what we were talking about so shocking that it wasn’t fit for general consumption? Would the office spontaneously explode if it turned out that the female accountants and aid workers in my organisation actually knew their Nissans from their Nobles? Why did they get so embarrassed talking about it?</p>
<p>“Well,” colleague X said philosophically, “I didn’t get into cars before because I thought that it was a traditional male thing. And that didn’t mean that I couldn’t do it, but blokes would know more about it than me starting off, and I didn’t want to feel stupid. Then it turned out that they knew just as little as I did.”</p>
<p>Two hours later, a male colleague decided to ask condescendingly what kind of engine we’d be rebuilding. Would it be, he said, sneering, a rotating one?</p>
<p>&#8220;A Wankel rotary?&#8221; I asked. No. It would be a four-stroke.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I’m not going to go into the many and varied reasons why, sitting on the sofa one November weekend, I decided that I wanted to know more about cars.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have a confession to make: I&#8217;m not actually a petrolhead. Not even a little bit. I didn&#8217;t play with cars as a little girl, and I didn&#8217;t go to track days with my father. I never learned to drive, and wouldn&#8217;t have been able to tell the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crankshaft">crankshaft</a> from the water pump even if you held a gun to my head.</p>
<p>At least, that was the case three months ago. I’m not going to go into the many and varied reasons why, sitting on the sofa one November weekend, I decided that I wanted to know more about cars. Suffice to say that maybe I was going a little house-crazy from being stuck indoors with the flu.</p>
<p>So I decided I was going to rebuild an engine.</p>
<p>This is a difficult and challenging task if you’ve worked with cars all your life. It is nigh on impossible if you can’t tell your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piston">pistons</a> from your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poppet_valve">poppets</a>. I also decided I was going to learn how to drive. This, too, would be a challenge, as the last time I’d been behind the wheel of a car had been twelve years ago. My father decided that, as I was seventeen and had my newly-minted provisional license in my pocket, the best thing to do for my first hour in the driver’s seat would be to take me out in London rush hour and make me practise three-point turns and parallel parking. After miraculously not killing anyone, I swore that I’d never get behind the wheel again.</p>
<p>The other major drawback is that my father was an engineer and a mechanic. He had engineering for his work, and mechanics for his hobby. You can imagine what his reaction would be if one of his children finally &#8211; finally! &#8211; showed an interest in anything remotely mechanical. Even if it was the girl.</p>
<p>Obviously, you can’t just walk off and buy yourself an engine. Well, actually, you can, but there’s not much point. First off, you have to work out where you’re going to keep it. There’s a useful space in the back garden, and I’ve measured for tarp, engine stand, and general manoeuvrability. It will, I am told, be sufficient.</p>
<p>Then, you have to come to terms with the fact that you’re building an engine, not a car. There’s no space to keep a clapped-out old banger in suburban London, and I’m not about to shell out for a garage for no apparent reason. The downside is that my beautiful rebuilt engine will never be seen in action. The upside is that I am far less likely to explode myself and the neighbours.</p>
<p>Thirdly, you’re going to need to get some tools and learn about engines. And therein lies the rub. Have you ever tried to find a general mechanics course? Have you? I have. There are two choices:</p>
<ol>
<li>Full-time year-long course leading to an NVQ or equivalent;</li>
<li>How to not explode your car when changing the oil.</li>
</ol>
<p>OK, so they weren’t terribly suitable. How about a textbook? I used to be an academic, I’m good with textbooks. Well –</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/INTERNAL-COMBUSTION-ENGINE-John-Heywood/dp/0071004998/ref=wl_it_dp_o?ie=UTF8&amp;coliid=IT8GDGY18CDRG&amp;colid=H3BWGWZ0MDIK"><strong>Internal Combustion Engine Fundamentals</strong></a> by John B. Heywood – looks interesting, and has been added to the wishlist.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Essential-Care-Girls-Danielle-McCormick/dp/0955732913/ref=wl_it_dp_o?ie=UTF8&amp;coliid=I1KE2NLY0FJP3R&amp;colid=H3BWGWZ0MDIK"><strong>Essential Car Care for Girls</strong></a> by Danielle McCormick – well, it’s pink. It must be just for girls. The reviewers helpfully point out that this is a book simple enough for even women to understand. OK, then.</li>
</ol>

<p>After wishlisting the first and stabbing my eyes out over the second, I decided that textbooks may be all well and good, but what I really needed was an opportunity to take the damn thing apart myself. (Yes, I was the child that disassembled all my toys to see how they worked.) Unfortunately, in order to do that… Yup, I was back at square one.</p>
<p>Despondent, I complained about this Catch 22 to a colleague of mine, who had been making similar noises about getting a little fed up of being pushed into a knitting club or daisy-counting-clique. What she really wanted, she said, was to mess about with something a little more robust, like an engine…</p>
<p>So. We’ve measured the back garden. We’ve ordered appropriate textbooks and acquired a couple of Haynes manuals. We’ve ordered a model engine to get a rough idea of how this all works. I’ve signed up for driving lessons in the vain hope that I can overcome my car phobia.</p>
<p>And then, once the sun comes out, we’re going to lay down the tarp and set up the engine stand, and buy a crappy clapped-out engine off eBay for 50p and take it apart.</p>
<p>I’m not going to tell my father a word about all of this. I have a horrible feeling that he will be so delighted that I have finally come around that he will decide to show me how to do it ‘properly’. Where my teachers failed to instil any interest in me at age 12, I am hoping that my own interest at age 29 will bear out and let me stick with it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><strong>If you are not paying for it, you&#8217;re not the customer; you&#8217;re the product being sold.</strong></p>
<p>Metafilter user blue_beetle in the thread <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/95152/Userdriven-discontent#3256046">User-driven discontent</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The above is a particularly trenchant quote that it is increasingly important to bear in mind, when using online services.</p>
<p>With any luck, most people reading this will already have read <a href="http://geekfeminism.org/2010/05/08/facebook-is-a-feminist-issue/">Facebook is a feminist issue</a>, and a lot of what&#8217;s being talking about here will be redundant.  In case you haven&#8217;t, though, and in case your clicking finger is suffering from temporary paralysis, the broad point it is making is that on-line privacy is a very, very real concern for feminists, since it affects any number of vulnerable classes of people, and particuarly those who are victims of abuse, and that Facebook is quite staggeringly bad when it comes to online privacy &#8211; it&#8217;s another path by which people can abuse one another, and more importantly, it makes it increasingly easy for abusers to track down and/or monitor the activity of their victims &#8211; even if their victims block their abuser from their profile, the abuser may still have friends in common with their victim, and therefore be able to see their victim&#8217;s activities where they intersect with friends via Facebook photo albums and similar.</p>
<p>Considered in the light of the above quote, it&#8217;s very easy to see why this is the case.  Facebook&#8217;s business model absolutely relies on sharing the personal information of its users with as wide an audience as possible, for marketing purposes &#8211; its user-base is the product that it sells.  But what&#8217;s worse is that even if you yourself choose not to share certain information, that&#8217;s no guarantee that it will not be available.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2009/09/20/project_gaydar_an_mit_experiment_raises_new_questions_about_online_privacy/?page=full">Project Gaydar</a> is a research project by some students at MIT, who built some software that analysed Facebook profiles.  They found that even if a person&#8217;s Facebook profile did not mention their sexual orientation, they could predict it to 85% accuracy, simply by analysing the profile data of the people they are Facebook friends with.  It&#8217;s important to stress that there&#8217;s no evidence of this research being used outside of the project, or with any sort of malicious intent &#8211; it&#8217;s simply a demonstration of the possibility.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that the problem presented by Project Gaydar is actually not Facebook&#8217;s fault.  It&#8217;s simply an emergent property of any social network, on-line or off &#8211; one is judged by the company one keeps.  And one cannot fault the companies that provide these services, and make us into the products they sell (without getting into anti-capitalist theory, a topic for another time and another place) &#8211; the companies are simply behaving as the market dictates.</p>
<p>And this sort of thing in only going to get worse &#8211; companies like <a href="http://www.foursquare.com">Foursquare</a>, <a href="http://www.gowalla.com">Gowalla</a>, and Facebook&#8217;s new &#8220;Places&#8221; feature make their users real-time location information available to their friends, on-line.  At time of writing, there hasn&#8217;t been a high-profile case of this sort of sensitive data being abused or leaked, but it&#8217;s surely only a matter of time.</p>
<p>Even beyond the sphere of social networking, there are, of course, other sorts of privacy concerns on-line, relating to anonymity &#8211; witness the outing in the press of <a href="http://girlwithaonetrackmind.blogspot.com/">Zoe Margolis</a> on the publication of her first book.  The issue of privacy management on-line is not going to go away any time soon, and as line between the online and the offline increasingly blurs away into nothing it&#8217;s a conversation that feminists should be gearing up to be part of.</p>
<p>So, what can you do?</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re concerned about your Facebook privacy settings, then you can look at <a href="http://www.reclaimprivacy.org/">Reclaimprivacy.org</a> &#8211; it&#8217;s a volunteer-run site that does its best to stay on top of the ever-shifting goalposts of Facebook privacy.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to do further reading on this issue surrounding social networks, privacy and vulnerable people, then searching the brilliant <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/">danah boyd&#8217;s archive</a> is likely to yield a lot of further reading &#8211; it&#8217;s not always her primary concern, but the nature of her research into social media means she comes up against it a lot.</p>
<p>You might also like to consider volunteering with, or donating to organisations like the <a href="http://www.eff.org">EFF</a> or the <a href="www.aclu.org">ACLU</a> both of which regularly deal with privacy issues as part of their broader remit, and whose blogs are good sources of information on current events in this area.</p>
