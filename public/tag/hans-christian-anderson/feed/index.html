<p>One of the 19<sup>th</sup> century’s best-loved stereotypes is that shivering waif, the Match Girl. Standing in the snow in a tattered shawl and starving to death in a picturesque way, she is well known to all of us thanks in large part to <a href="http://www.online-literature.com/hans_christian_andersen/981/">Hans Christian Anderson</a>.<sup><a href="/2011/09/06/revolting-women-the-matchgirls-strike-or-working-class-teenagers-kick-corporate-ass/#footnote_0_6095" id="identifier_0_6095" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" I am being flippant here but in fact the story reduces me to a crying mess of sentimentality and socialist idealism.

I&#8217;m not saying for a moment that life wasn&#8217;t hellish for the matchgirls, and the rest of the Victorian working classes. But I welcome any attempt to dig a little deeper than the hand-wringing <a href="http://www.bapla.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=46&amp;Itemid=89&amp;favm=2098&amp;stype=story">waifporn</a> of many contemporary accounts to uncover the experiences and agency of actual persons.</p>
<p>One famous event which lends these pathetic characters another dimension and a bit of agency is the Bow Bryant &amp; May match factory strike of 1888. The broadly accepted chain of events is this…</p>
<h3>Annie Besant</h3>
<p>Outspoken socialist, women’s rights campaigner and general lefty do-gooder <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Besant"><strong>Annie Besant</strong></a> heard a lecture by <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Wblack.htm">Clementina Black</a> about the terrible working conditions in Bryant &amp; May factories. She discovered that the women worked 14 hours a day for less than five shillings a week, and didn’t often receive this thanks to a system of fines for offences including talking, dropping matches or going to the toilet without permission.</p>

<p>Besant also learnt that the women’s health had been damaged by the phosphorous used to make the matches, which caused yellowing of the skin, hair loss and ‘phossy jaw’, a jolly name for a particularly gruesome kind of facial bone cancer.</p>
<p>Appalled, Besant went to the gates of the factory in Bow the next day and interviewed some of the women as they were leaving. Having the stories confirmed, she wrote an article for her newspaper <strong>The Link</strong> with the incendiary title ‘<a href="http://www.mernick.org.uk/thhol/thelink.html">White Slavery In London</a>&#8216;.</p>
<p>In response to the bad PR, Bryant &amp; May cleverly attempted to force their workers to sign a statement that they were happy with their working conditions. When a group of women refused to sign, the organisers of the group were sacked, and the rest of the workforce reacted: 1,400 of the women at Bryant &amp; May went on strike.</p>
<p>Cue national uproar. Besant gathered support for her campaign from a number of prominent figures who all seem to have had their own newspapers, and they used them to call for a boycott of Bryant &amp; May matches. The women at the company formed a Matchgirls&#8217; Union and Besant agreed to become its leader. After three weeks the company announced that it would re-employ the dismissed women and bring an end to the fines system. The sacked women returned in triumph.</p>
<h3>Matchwomen</h3>
<p>According to this version of events, Annie Besant encouraged and led the factory workers to strike for better conditions. Certainly the identities of the girls and women involved in the strike have been obscured by her fame.</p>

I don&#39;t know who is who I&#39;m afraid (except Besant, standing, centre)</p></div>
<p>But a new book by <a href="http://www.louiseraw.co.uk/">Louise Raw</a> claims that the impetus and leadership for the strike came from the women themselves, and Annie Besant got most of the credit because she was already notorious. And because she was middle class &#8211; there were doubts in many circles that the matchwomen themselves could have organised their way out of a paper bag without the help of a learned socialist.</p>
<p>This <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=408305&amp;sectioncode=26"><strong>Times Higher Ed</strong></a> review of <<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Striking-Light-Bryant-Matchwomen-History/dp/1441114262/ref=tmm_pap_title_0"><strong>Striking a Light: The Truth About the Match Girls Strike and the Women Behind It</strong></a> explains that the matchwomen “have not been hidden from history but hidden by history” because the standard account of events very early on became the go-to example of women’s industrial action, even to the point of cliché, so historians have avoided revising it. Until now:</p>
<blockquote><p>In a careful reconstruction of events, Raw exposes inaccuracies in the standard accounts which, while petty, suggest a lazy acceptance of a chronology that fits the conventional story. Not only was Besant not the first mover, and she was probably neither sympathetic to strike action nor optimistic about its outcome, preferring instead a boycott of Bryant and May… Raw&#8217;s revised account has the match women themselves deciding to strike, generating leaders and possessing a solidarity usually denied to unskilled workers of this era, especially female ones.</p></blockquote>
<p>BBC History magazine recorded an interview with Raw, which is available as a <a href="http://www.louiseraw.co.uk/podcastapr1a.mp3">podcast</a>. If you’re at all interested I recommend it. In the interview she names the five ‘ringleaders’ identified by Bryant &amp; May &#8211; Kate Slater, Alice Barnes, Jane Wakely, Eliza Martin, Mary Driscoll – and describes newspaper accounts about their charisma, inspiring speeches and popularity with the other factory workers. Rather wonderfully, Raw was able to find out more about these women after three of their grandchildren approached her at her talks at the <a href="http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/docklands/">Museum in Docklands</a> and the <a href="http://www.raggedschoolmuseum.org.uk/nextgen/">Ragged School Museum</a>. Local history events FTW!</p>
<p>The Matchgirls&#8217; Strike is a landmark in the history of women and protest, but also in labour history. It famously inspired the Dockers’ Strike: the organisers sought advice from the Matchgirls Union and continually referenced them in their speeches.</p>

<h2>BUT WAIT! Where is the pop culture link?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Well, I reckon the story about the ‘troublemaker’ Eva Smith who leads a factory strike in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Inspector_Calls"><strong>An Inspector Calls</strong></a> may well have been inspired by the matchgirls. Here’s a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Av9BoOCDF_4&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=506s">YouTube clip</a> of the relevant bit.</li>
<li>Secondly, in the course of my researches I discovered that there is a MUSICAL version of the matchgirl’s story, called, er, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matchgirls"><strong>The Matchgirls</strong></a>. It looks appalling. Here’s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amqqwzTITck">one of the songs</a> from it.</li>
<li>Then I found out that lovely East London history music project <strong>Songs From The Howing Sea</strong> have done a song about the strike! <a href="http://www.songsfromthehowlingsea.com/wk-27-the-matchgirls-strike-video/">Listen here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="footnotes"><li id="footnote_0_6095" class="footnote"> I am being flippant here but in fact the story reduces me to a crying mess of sentimentality and socialist idealism. There’s also a good recent <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE7CVCuMz0">Disney / Pixar animation</a>. For a horrible moment I thought they were going to happy-end it a la <strong>The Little Mermaid</strong> and <strong>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</strong> but they let her die. </li></ol>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[There’s one book which, in my opinion, has succeeded in reclaiming stories once used to repress and control women (and by extension everyone else) to a far greater extent than any other: Angela Carter’s The Bloody Chamber.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Guest post time again: regular reader Russell reminds us why Angela Carter should still be on your Essential Reading list, or if you&#8217;ve never read her, why you should start&#8230;</strong></em></p>
<blockquote><p>The tiger will never lie down with the lamb; he acknowledges no pact that is not reciprocal. The lamb must learn to run with the tigers.</p>
<p>&#8211; Angela Carter, <strong>The Tiger’s Bride</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Fairy tales weren’t always Disney cartoons. Once upon a time, they were part of an oral tradition passed down from mother to child, cautionary tales about the horrors that lurked in the woods, and the dangers of going off the path. They were much bloodier back then, much scarier, and with a lot more impact. Then along came the Brothers Grimm and Hans Anderson, and other men who liked writing things down and only wrote down what they liked. The fairy tales got sillier from there, cautionary tales without any of the blood and violence that made them worth paying heed to in the first place. They only got worse with Disney (though some of us love Disney movies, occasionally even with <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0398286/">good reason</a>).</p>

Modern authors have taken the sanitised narratives we were all told as kids, and twisted them, into something we recognise but appreciate in a very different way. They’re still the stories we know, but not only has the blood and gore reappeared, they’ve grown up in much the same way as our society has grown up. Rather than warning our children that they should stick to the route life’s prepared for them, walk the road to happy marriage and 2.4 kids, they instead encourag stepping away from the traditional routes, rebelling against authority, and reclaiming traditional feminine roles which are often painted in a negative light. Or they tell grown-up stories about characters traditionally relegated to the most sanitised view of childhood. There are countless modern fables which also play much the same roles as traditional folk tales, from the insanely popular wizard kids of <strong>Harry Potter</strong> to fables shrouded in mystery and played on a concept album.</p>
<p>Through all of this, there’s one book which, in my opinion, has succeeded in reclaiming stories once used to repress and control women (and by extension everyone else) to a far greater extent than any other: Angela Carter’s <strong>The Bloody Chamber</strong>. As Carter herself asserted, the stories therein are not simply updated or “adult” versions of the traditional stories (she really hated this idea). Rather, they build on the essence of the originals; not those set down by the likes of Perrault, but the <em>original</em> stories, those told in the oral tradition. From a linguistic or anthropological point of view, it’s a fascinating experiment: how would those stories have evolved and changed over the years if the game of Chinese whispers that is oral storytelling hadn’t been brought to a stop?</p>
<p>The result, updated versions of Bluebeard, Beauty and the Beast (twice), Puss In Boots, Snow White (kinda), Red Riding Hood (two or three times), plus a vampire story and a sort of<br />
Red Riding Hood/Alice Through The Looking Glass amalgam, is a brilliantly charged piece of work. Charged emotionally, through our strongly forged connection to these stories; charged sexually, through the transition of the stories from cautionary tales to fables of teenage awakening; and crammed with ideas and themes, many of which it’s fair to say would be beyond the young minds to which these stories were once told. Instead of telling children how to behave themselves, they tell adults how not to behave themselves.</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, the traditional versions of these stories are very often about staying “on the path”, the course society sets for an individual based on their gender and circumstances. Nowhere is this more evident than in the traditional Red Riding Hood story; a little girl follows a shortcut through the woods, deviating from the way she’s been told to go, and as a result she and a matriarchal figure are murdered by a vicious beast, or rescued by a male hero who is otherwise absent from the story. In Carter’s versions, the little girl leaves the path, and the rewards, while terrifying, are great. In <strong>The Company of Wolves</strong>, the wolf becomes an image of feral sexuality, with the adolescent Red Riding Hood sleeping with him at the end. In<strong> The Werewolf</strong>, Granny herself is the wolf; a certain metaphor for how traditional ideas of the feminine role are monstrous &#8211; Red Riding Hood kills her, and inherits all her stuff. In <strong>Wolf Alice</strong>, which merges a variant of the story with elements of <strong>Through The Looking Glass</strong>, the titular character emerges from a feral childhood, not into the socialised womanhood which the nuns taking care of her demand, but instead redeeming the vampiric Duke in whose care she is left by the power of her sexual awakening.</p>
<p>Sexual power is a primary theme in many of the stories. Carter refutes the view of female sexuality as passive and submissive; such sex is presented as a sterile, pleasureless experience. The titular story, and also the longest, goes into this in detail with a version of the Bluebeard story set in the 1930s. The narrator, also the heroine, marries the familiar murderer. Rather than merely dying, as in some versions of the fairy tale, or being rescued by a male saviour, it is her mother, a badass world-travelling tiger hunter, who comes to the rescue. The “saviour male” is replaced with a blind piano tuner who ultimately becomes the heroine’s lover, taking the sexual emphasis away from the visual with which Bluebeard is so obsessed, and placing it firmly where it belongs: in the realm of the sensual.</p>

I have to say this is probably my favourite story in the collection, with its beautiful emphasis on primal power and strength rather than civilised control. Beauty is at first an object, a thing given to the Beast to repay a gambling debt. It’s through her own acknowledgement and understanding of her bestial side that she claims freedom, and achieves her transformation, which in a reversal of the traditional fairy tale beast transformation is not a horrifying punishment, but a liberating reward.</p>
<p>In many ways, these stories aren’t for children. They’re complex narratives which many adults would struggle with. On the other hand, these stories, which challenge the expected ideas and cautionary tales of behaving like good girls and boys, are in a way exactly what we should be telling our kids: there are terrible things out there, <em>and some of them are you.</em> It’s no longer worth staying on the path. It’s time to explore the woods.<br />
<strong><br />
New to Carter? Other things to try: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Company of Wolves</strong> was turned<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087075/"> into a film</a>, although it’s more based on Carter’s radio version of the story.  Contains more fairy tales, and is a better werewolf movie than <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/04/22/at-the-movies-red-riding-hood/">some recent films</a>.</li>
<li> For more Angela Carter, there&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Magic-Toyshop-Virago-modern-classics/dp/0860681904/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1304358762&#038;sr=1-1"><strong>The Magic Toyshop</strong></a></li>
<li> For more modified, subversive fairy tales, you could do worse than check out <strong>Neil Gaiman</strong>.  His short story <strong>Snow, Glass, Apples</strong>, which is available in <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Smoke-Mirrors-Neil-Gaiman/dp/0755322835/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1304613941&#038;sr=1-3"><strong>Smoke and Mirrors</strong></a>, recasts Snow White as a vampire.  He’s also tackled a number of other fairy tales from various cultures in his numerous different works, and written a few fables of his own that aren’t too far removed.</li>
</ul>
