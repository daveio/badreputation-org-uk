<h3>Round One: Marvin the Martian and the Furious Boobs</h3>
<p><strong>Miranda:</strong> So I thought we could look at what&#8217;s on sale for Halloween this year. Jen sent me <a href="http://io9.com/5852860/this-years-sluttiest-and-weirdest-store+bought-halloween-costumes/gallery/1">this</a> from io9. It&#8217;s titled &#8220;this year&#8217;s sluttiest and weirdest store-bought Halloween costumes&#8221;, and while I&#8217;d question the use of &#8220;slutty&#8221; perhaps, the point stands: the gulf between MAN SUIT and LADY VERSION (for we are in polarised gender binary land forever, of course) here is&#8230; well, case in point, <a href="http://io9.com/5852860/this-years-sluttiest-and-weirdest-store+bought-halloween-costumes/gallery/6 ">Marvin the Martian</a>. Are you a man? Then your eyes go on your HEAD! Are you a woman? Then your eyes go on your TITS! That is the WAY THINGS ARE DONE AROUND HERE, PLEASE LINE UP TO PAY.</p>

<p><strong>Jenni:</strong> I think it&#8217;s very considerate of them to leave out the leggings on the ladies&#8217; costume. &#8220;Girls! Want to show off your new spray-tan and waxed-smooth legs yet STILL want to dress as a cartoon Martian? This costume is for you. Men, nobody wants to see your legs. They must be covered at all times. Put them away.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Miranda: </strong>I mean, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Marvinthemartain.jpg ">Marvin&#8217;s key features</a> include his very engulfing polo neck. But why bother with that &#8220;recognisable&#8221; shit when you can STICK EYES ON YOUR BOOBULARS.</p>
<p><strong>Sarah J:</strong> You know, I almost &#8211; <em>almost</em> &#8211; like this one. Of course the woman&#8217;s costume is barely recognisable as Marvin anyway, but without the boots, hat and gun you&#8217;ve got a pretty awesome boobfurious dress that says: &#8216;Yes, my breasts hate you&#8217;. Perfect for so many occasions! Whereas the romano-cyber-sportswear interpretation the man&#8217;s wearing looks kind of rubbish.</p>
<p><strong>Miranda:</strong> I can definitely get behind the Boob Fury interpretation. Maybe I was being too harsh.</p>
<p><strong>Markgraf:</strong> The thing Halloween costumes highlight for me every year is how no-one knows how the fuck to dress men. Women, in this ciscentric, binarist view of costuming, have sections: boobs, waist, arse and legs. And you can section costumes accordingly to highlight whichever of these areas you prefer. But men, right, they HAVE no areas! They&#8217;re just&#8230; a long rectangle! What the fuck are you meant to do with that?! I feel the costumier&#8217;s despair wafting out of my monitor like the sad back end of a horse. It&#8217;s the same school of thought that leads cybergoth fashion to dress women like awesome robots from the future crossed with angry Christmas trees, and men in a t-shirt and jeans (but black, and with rubber bits on). Men have sections as well, on account of also possessing a skeleton and body mass! And they can get away with showing off more skin, too, because man nipples are inexplicably inoffensive. It&#8217;s not hard, designers! Don&#8217;t let society rule you! Go for it! Break free of the top-half-bottom-half block painting of menswear! Give us thigh-high things and stuff to show off our shoulders! Do it or I&#8217;ll dress up as a Pokemon!</p>
