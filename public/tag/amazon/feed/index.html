					<description><![CDATA[Why Kinect avatars made us woo and Game falling over made us boo.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>March was a big one in the world of gaming and not just because of the titles that came out. Here in the UK there&#8217;s been other big news that I&#8217;d be somewhat remiss not to mention, so please forgive me if I veer slightly away from a simple account of what I&#8217;ve been up to. So today I&#8217;ll be talking (briefly) about <strong>Mass Effect 3</strong> and the <strong>Xbox Kinect</strong> but I&#8217;ll also wander into the murky world of the financial crisis and its impact on gamers cruising the high streets.</p>
<p>First off: the games.  Obviously there’s <strong> Mass Effect 3</strong>, but as I&#8217;ve mentioned before, there will be a full post dedicated to that shortly.  For now, though, I&#8217;ll say that it&#8217;s a great addition to anyone’s collection: well-constructed story, superb combat mechanics, good graphics and generally an absorbing and engaging universe.  The ending(s) have caused issues among some fans of the franchise, and although I shan’t say here what they were or why that is, I’ll just say that <em>I</em> had no problem with the way it ended.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Rai-xbox-av.png"><img data-attachment-id="10575" data-permalink="/2012/04/11/gamer-diary-what-ive-been-playing-march-2012/rai-xbox-av/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Rai-xbox-av.png?fit=131%2C278&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="131,278" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Wvelkala avatar (Rai)" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Rai-xbox-av.png?fit=131%2C278&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Rai-xbox-av.png?fit=131%2C278&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-10575" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Rai-xbox-av.png?resize=131%2C278" alt="an Xbox Kinect avatar - a CGI caucasian figure with reddish-blonde spiked hair, a red t-shirt and black combat pants. Image: author's own." width="131" height="278" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Better then that we talk about the <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-GB/kinect"><strong>Kinect</strong></a>.  I got one at the beginning of March and a few little games to go along with it.  <strong>Kinect Adventures</strong> is the title that comes with every single sensor (if you’re buying second-hand, be sure to check!) and it is a simple bit of fun.  You use your body to complete little challenges on the screen, collect points and progress through various ranks of adventurer.  It&#8217;s a little bit addictive when you first get the Kinect as it’s all very new and novel and amazing, but in the long run it would probably hold the attention of younger gamers or be best suited to family-centred gaming sessions.</p>
<p>I also got <strong>Kinect Sports</strong> (the first game), which proved much more popular between my partner and I.  You get the option to partake in six different events: Football (Soccer), Bowling (10-pin), Table Tennis, Track &amp; Field (which contains six events in itself), Boxing and Beach Volleyball.  Again, this is a great bit of fun and you can use it for a spot of exercise as well.  You can play against four levels of computer opponent, as well as playing against your friends (or with them) online or in the same room.  You garner points and progress towards Champion status, but really it’s all about the amusement and the potential for collective gaming.</p>
<p>There are another two Kinect games knocking about my living room, but I didn’t want to talk about them as they don’t have the rather pleasing feature I’m about to detail.  The Kinect games that use your Xbox Avatar in-game (especially in Sports) are also populated with lots of other Avatar people as your opponents or team-mates.  Now, this may not sound altogether too ground-breaking or interesting, but for me it was quite nice to see a fairly equal mix of &#8211; albeit randomly generated &#8211; Avatars of all descriptions.  In simpler terms, they aren’t all male.  Even on team sports that are traditionally &#8216;single sex&#8217; sports (like football) you have men and women of all ages charging about the pitch with you.  I thought that was a nice little nod &#8211; particularly for games that will have a lot of younger, more impressionable gamers &#8211; just to say “Hey, women exist too!”.</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/game-logo-1.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="10602" data-permalink="/2012/04/11/gamer-diary-what-ive-been-playing-march-2012/game-logo-1/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/game-logo-1.jpg?fit=289%2C249&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="289,249" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="game-logo (1)" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/game-logo-1.jpg?fit=289%2C249&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/game-logo-1.jpg?fit=289%2C249&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/game-logo-1.jpg?resize=289%2C249" alt="A purple splatter of paint on a white background with the word &#039;GAME&#039; in white on top of the purple.  The logo of the Game high street shop." title="game-logo (1)" width="289" height="249" class="alignright size-full wp-image-10602" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
Now for the depressing stuff.  The company <strong>Game</strong> <a title="Game Group enters administration - Financial Times" href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/25440a6a-7745-11e1-baf3-00144feab49a.html?ftcamp=published_links/rss/companies/feed//product#axzz1qsG1aPrv" target="_blank">went belly-up</a> in March and already my local <strong>Gamestation</strong> (part of the group) has been stripped bare and locked up tight, never to be set foot in again.  I admit I rarely bought anything from Game or Gamestation, but as the last notable games-only high street chain, it&#8217;s sad to see it fail.  As a PC gamer at heart, I felt the group had forgotten about me over the years as it focused more on console gamers &#8211; and that’s fair enough if that’s where the money is &#8211; but apparently that didn’t bring in enough revenue to save them.</p>
<p>Things were not helped when <strong>EA</strong> refused to supply the group with copies of <strong>Mass Effect 3</strong> on credit and they had to give everyone who had pre-ordered their money back.  Even a few days before they closed up shop, the Gamestation I usually wander around was begging for trade-ins of the title as not a single brand new copy was in sight.  I suspect this may have been the last straw for many customers, but the advent of the internet worked its evil glory too: after all, if you can buy a two-week-old title for £15 on <strong>Amazon</strong> when it remains £30+ in a high street store, why <em>would</em> you go that extra mile and pay more?</p>
<p>It is, nevertheless, a little saddening to see the group suffer the same fate as many other high street names.  Should they remain, in one form or another, I hope they can take a more competitive stance on the price war with the internet and stop pricing themselves out of the market. <a href="http://www.bitterwallet.com/game-where-do-consumers-stand-post-administration/55054">Game&#8217;s statement</a> has more detail on the immediate results of their entry into administration. </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/bb/Skate_2_Cover.jpg" alt="cover for EA Games' Skate 2- a simple design with the title in white font overlaid across an image of two upturned skateboards." width="143" height="179" /></p>
<h3>One final word&#8230;</h3>
<p>Coincidentally, a couple of days before Game was declared a financial black hole, my partner bought himself <strong>Skate 2</strong>.  You may remember January&#8217;s Gamer Diary, where I <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/02/13/gamer-diary-what-ive-been-playing-january-2012/">mentioned</a> watching him play <strong>Skate</strong> and lamented that there were zero lady-boarders.  Well, in the second instalment, there <em>are</em> girls flying around on boards, and you can also choose to be one.  Super!  Also, the mechanics and graphics are much improved.  It has, however, to me been dubbed ‘Skate 2 AKA “<em>Shut up, Reda!</em>”’.  Don’t worry if you don’t know who Reda is; all you need to know is he talks too much.</p>
<h3>Next Time</h3>
<p>I’ll be honest: I don&#8217;t yet know what the remainder of April will bring for me.  Never fear!  I will locate juicy content for you and in the meantime you&#8217;ll soon be able to read all about what I made of <strong>ME3</strong> at last.</p>

<p>I like that a selection of predominantly internet-based feminist thought (can haz meme plz?) is being used to kick up a righteous fuss over what is by all accounts a pile of terrible tosh not worth the paper it&#8217;s printed on. It&#8217;s a great example of theory-into-action: the fact that tagging is used on Amazon to  organise and categorise books means that these tags help users identify and avoid anti-feminist writing.</p>
<p>My personal favourites in the tag cloud include <a href="http://kateharding.net/2010/01/27/me-a-mansplainer-let-me-mansplain/">mansplaining</a>, <a href="http://finallyfeminism101.wordpress.com/2007/05/10/faq-but-men-and-women-are-born-different-isnt-that-obvious/">gender essentialism</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transphobia">transphobia</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>New week, new poster&#8230; and a change of tone. Meet Hodge, folks, and the first letter in her fully illustrated Alphabet series, where we do a bit of dictionary-delving, art history and culture-vulturing from A to Z.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Welcome to Hodge&#8217;s <strong>ALPHABET OF FEMINISM</strong>, inaugural entry, number one: pull up a chair, gather your hot beverages round.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The more specific aims of this series of posts will, it is hoped, become clearer through practice, as it works from A-Z.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But put simply, the idea is to address (with reasonable neutrality), the make-up of the English mother-tongue, to consider how the language has evolved over the centuries, and in the process to prompt some questions about how gender issues are woven into the fabric of the language we use everyday.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Incidentally, when I refer to &#8216;the dictionary&#8217;, I am referring to the Oxford English Dictionary.</p>
<h6 style="text-align: center;">A</h6>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">AMAZON</h2>

<p>For those readers who never owned the Greek alphabet on a tea-towel, the &#8216;maz&#8217; sound mid-<em>Amazon</em> is the same &#8216;maz&#8217; you find in &#8216;mastectomy&#8217; and its (mostly medical) cognates. This is because the Amazons in question – a race of female warriors alleged to have lived in ancient Scythia, and the first definition for the first word of the Alphabet of Femininism (hoorah!) – were said to have been rather expert in just this procedure. Or, as the dictionary puts it, rather dryly – and, indeed, euphemistically – &#8216;they destroyed their right breast to avoid interfering with the use of the bow&#8217;.</p>
<p>In so self-mastectomising, this army of women obviously lay themselves open to the extended (and more explicitly gender-specific) meaning that <em>amazon</em> took on around the mid-eighteenth century. Here, an <em>amazon </em>is &#8216;a very strong, tall, or masculine woman&#8217;, unsurprising since they are, etymologically, removers of those most vexed of female glands in favour of ease in brandishing weaponry (more generally considered A Man&#8217;s Job).</p>
<p>This all said, the original Amazons do not appear to have been either an (exclusively) lesbian tribe, or even an anti-maternal one: Strabo, the Greek geographer, would have it that they periodically had a baby-breeding field trip to a neighbouring male tribe (the Gargareans). The resultant boy-children were exposed or sent back to their fathers; the girls kept and trained up In The Amazon Way, a rare gender upending for the olden days.</p>
<h3>Alas! My Girdle!</h3>
<p>But perhaps the most famous of these dedicated Amazons is Hippolyte-slash-Hippolyta, the owner of a  magical &#8216;girdle&#8217;, which Hercules stole in one of his less catchy labours (bit pathetic altogether, isn&#8217;t it? It&#8217;s got a bit of a spotty thirteen year old boy feel to it, in fact. &#8216;Hey Hercules! See that woman? I dare you to steal her girdle! Yeeah, dude, you rock!&#8217; – That said, I&#8217;ve never been completely sure what a &#8216;girdle&#8217; means in Ancient Scythia: I can&#8217;t really imagine an army of one-breasted women in the habit of frequent &#8216;bow handling&#8217; being particularly concerned about how cinched their waists are. My childhood book of <em>Greek Myths And Legends</em> depicts it as a sort of extra snazzy belt, so that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going with).</p>

<p>Ahem. Post-Hercules, Hippolyta appears in every battered school copy of <strong>A Midsummer Night&#8217;s Dream</strong>, as the future wife of Theseus, who &#8216;wooed her with his sword&#8217; (oh Theseus, you charmer), and ex-flame of Oberon, King of The Fairies. Shakespeare, whose use of language is so influential that you can expect to bump into him frequently in these dark and twisted lexical corridors, isn&#8217;t otherwise a great user of the word <em>amazon</em>, although he does make it into the dictionary&#8217;s quotations for the word&#8217;s extended, more generic sense, as &#8216;a female warrior&#8217;, which is the first in a pair that ends in the aforementioned &#8216;very strong, tall, or masculine woman&#8217;, unsurprisingly considered &#8216;forbidding to men&#8217; by the author of <em>Sermons To Young Women </em>in the eighteenth century.</p>
<h3>Dot Com</h3>
<p>One contemporary application this more general sense has had, curiously enough, is in the modelling world, where the &#8216;freakish&#8217; aesthetic of catwalk models (and presumably also their exoticism) makes the designation &#8216;amazon&#8217; / &#8216;amazonian&#8217; in its sense as a &#8216;very strong, tall, or masculine woman&#8217; surprisingly true to its lexical origin (annoyingly, if fittingly, for the inaugural post of an alphabet, the prominence of a particular shopping site &#8216;everything from A-Z&#8217;, and the tendencies of said supermodels to write their autobiographies, obscures any such instances of the word on Google, so you&#8217;ll have to take my nonspecific memory for it).</p>
<p>Moving on, I particularly like the further sense <em>amazon </em>acquired sometime around the sixteenth or seventeenth century – now, alas, obsolete – as &#8216;the queen in chess&#8217;, who I always thought of as quiet sort of feminist icon, maintaining, as Francis Beale asserts, &#8216;alwayes&#8230;her owne colour&#8217;, and zipping around the board with an alacrity denied to her technically more important consort.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>To the men an Amazon never fails to be forbidding.</strong></p>
<p>JAMES FORDYCE, Sermons To Young Women (published 1767)</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>The Queen, or Amazon, is placed in the fourth house from the corner of the field by the side of her King, and alwayes in her owne colour.</strong></p>
<p>FRANCIS BEALE, <em>Biochimo&#8217;s Royall Game of Chesse-play</em> (translated 1656)</p></blockquote>
<h3>Yes, But How Many People Does She Shag?</h3>
<p>As will become tediously common during these gynocentric word-journeys, it seems virtually impossible to think of a &#8216;strong, masculine woman&#8217; without at some point branching into her sexuality; thus, the final meaning of <em>amazon</em> (unsurprisingly, the Victorians&#8217; contribution) as in opposition to a &#8216;vestal&#8217; (another group of women bound together tribal-style, although for an altogether different purpose). As in, &#8216;Oh man, that girl&#8217;s no vestal; she&#8217;s an <em>amazon.</em>&#8216;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">However, <em>amazon</em> is actually a bit of a relief because its overwhelming lexical impression is one of a guarded kind of respect: Hippolyta would, I think, be satisfied.<a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/A-is-for-Amazon.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="3213" data-permalink="/2010/10/04/an-alphabet-of-femininism-1-a-is-for-amazon/a-is-for-amazon/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/A-is-for-Amazon.jpg?fit=1426%2C1784&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1426,1784" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="A is for Amazon" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/A-is-for-Amazon.jpg?fit=239%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/A-is-for-Amazon.jpg?fit=818%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3213" title="A is for Amazon" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/A-is-for-Amazon-818x1024.jpg?resize=573%2C717" alt="Illustration by Hodge: inital A for Amazon in blue.
