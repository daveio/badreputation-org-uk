					<description><![CDATA[She deserves a better class of memorialist.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/CajpSeUvCPY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amywinehouse.com/" target="_blank">Amy Winehouse</a>, for all the typically Machiavellian marketing behind her early development and signing, was an atypical star to launch, even before the drink, drugs, bisexuality, tattoos and self-harm and sprawling domestic disharmony on the streets of Camden set in. 2003 was a year of slickly manufactured, crowdpleasing pop anthems spawned by reality tv or established industry hit machines: Britney, Christina, Avril, Beyoncé, Sugababes, Rachel Stevens, Girls Aloud. In this climate, Winehouse&#8217;s debut <strong>Frank</strong>, an engagingly personal and subtly powerful blend of jazz, soul, dub and heavy drinking, stood out as an album of grit among gloss, accomplished and ambitious, recalling the eclectic and impeccably imperious style of Dinah Washington and Nina Simone.</p>
<p>Equally, despite her status as a product of the Sylvia Young and Brit stage schools, Winehouse was hardly manufactured, having been a genuinely talented singer, guitarist and songwriter from a young age. The lyrics she produced and her delivery of them were cool, critical and cynical – <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVaqQe3V498" target="_blank">&#8216;Fuck Me Pumps&#8217;</a> is a punchily sung and scathing dismissal of the dominant gold-digging paradigm. Her definitive, self-mythologising single <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LTPRJqt2z4" target="_blank">&#8216;Rehab&#8217;</a>, despite its refrain&#8217;s predictable propensity to generate tasteless jokes and mawkish headlines in the wake of her death, is a staggering song of self-awareness, wiped clean of messy emoting or self-pity and resolutely swerving any courting of sorrow or sympathy. Its protagonist does not bewail her fate in the clasp of addiction but makes her refusal to be pathologised an active and empowering choice – &#8216;no, no, no&#8217; means no. Like much of Winehouse&#8217;s material, the song addresses and analyses addiction, dependency, depression and the complexities of female independence with a wry, arch, clear-eyed and mocking wit that could have leavened the weight of many a confessional memoir.</p>
<p>To evaluate Winehouse&#8217;s career as a story of potential unfulfilled, as many obituaries are doing, is to ignore the quality of second album <strong>Back to Black</strong>, with its clutch of BRITs, Grammys and Ivor Novellos, as well as the sheer depth of its influence. Winehouse&#8217;s international success began a scramble by record companies to scrounge up similar eclectic and experimental female artists. It is perhaps unfortunate that all this process actually got us was an indistinguishable female-centred quirk-quake comprised of <a href="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article6725104.ece" target="_blank">Little Pixie Roux and the Machine for Lashes</a>, as well as current favourites Adele and Duffy – both well-behaved, clean and immaculately blue-eyed biters of a vintage musical style which Winehouse had almost singlehandedly reinvigorated. For all their undoubted technical ability, such singers purvey blandly perfect reproductions of retro soul, whereas Winehouse was able to inhabit past musical modes like she wore her Ronettes-inspired beehive, investing them with something contemporary and compelling through that awesome, syrupy, rolling contralto. Her aesthetic – glamorously grubby, leonine and Cleopatra-eyed – was similarly inimitable and atypical. Even Lady Gaga <a href="http://www.popeater.com/2009/03/16/lady-gaga-loves-strange-girls-like-amy-winehouse/" target="_blank">credited </a>Winehouse with smoothing the path to mainstream success for other &#8216;strange girls&#8217;.</p>
<p>The tributes to Amy Winehouse clotting the front pages this past weekend reflect the other aspect of her fame: the purpose she served as media cipher. The narrative into which she was coralled – discovered, lauded, rewarded, exploited, drug-ravaged and wrung dry by the cynics and sycophants around her – is a traditional trajectory for women in the public eye, from Marilyn to Britney. Mixed in with the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/may/06/amy-winehouse-jean-rhys-addiction" target="_blank">clichés </a>of the demon-driven artist, Winehouse&#8217;s dedication to the life of a good-time girl provided an obvious temptation for the press to shoehorn the shapeless and slippery business of living into a rigid mould of Meaning, to make her a signifier of the plagues afflicting modern womanhood &#8211; not all of modern womanhood, of course, just those of us susceptible to the lure of urban independence and its giddy, glittering thrills.</p>
<p>There is an obvious irony in the fact that the media&#8217;s very concentration on her as a reliably scandalous page-filler embedded her in public consciousness as not an artist but a cautionary tale of misjudged relationships and worse-judged substance indulgence, eliciting a weird and volatile mixture of compassion and contempt. There was, too, a ghoulish and lascivious edge to public concern over Winehouse &#8211; as there was, back in the day, over Courtney Love and, latterly, Britney Spears &#8211; which is seldom present in attitudes to their male counterparts. The same organs which engorged themselves with pictures of Winehouse in her various stages of decline, distress and debauchery are continuing to objectify and sensationalise her as, inevitably, a &#8216;brilliant but troubled&#8217; combination of tragic loss and dreadful warning. She deserves a better class of memorialist.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Another week, another women-in-music controversy, and another hotly debated video from Rihanna.  I'm just glad debate is happening and that we have a mainstream artist who doesn't shy away from instigating it.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Another week, another women-in-music controversy, and another hotly debated video from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rihanna"><strong>Rihanna</strong></a>. Having ticked  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uelHwf8o7_U">domestic violence</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/verify_age?next_url=http%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DKdS6HFQ_LUc">sadomasochism </a>off the musical list, she’s responded to recent  <a href="http://www.wingfantasy.com/rihanna-christina-aguilera-face-criticism-outrageous-outfits-xfactor/">accusations </a> of being a major player in the oversexualisation of pop by upping the ante, making her latest offering a blend of sexual violence and violent retribution. The video for <strong>Man Down</strong>, which opens with Rihanna shooting a man who is later revealed to have assaulted her after they dance at a club, has kicked up a <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/157962/20110606/rihanna-man-down-parents-television-council-ptc-chris-brwon-sexual-assault-rape-victim-feminism-bet.htm">predictable </a> <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1665121/rihanna-man-down-controversy.jhtml">media </a> <a href="http://www.bet.com/shows/106-and-park/news/rihanna-man-down.html">dustcloud</a>. It&#8217;s all a far cry from<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEauWw9ZGrA"> &#8216;Pon de Replay&#8217;</a>.</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/sEhy-RXkNo0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Amid <a href="http://www.metro.co.uk/music/865073-rihannas-man-down-video-should-be-banned-say-us-pressure-groups">calls</a> for the video to be banned, it&#8217;s interesting to see how much of the outrage centres on the murder, rather than the rape. Granted, the shooting and its aftermath is shown far more explicitly than the hinted-at assault, but commentary such as that of media watchdog Paul Porter:</p>
<blockquote><p>“‘Man Down’ is an inexcusable, shock-only, shoot-and-kill theme song. In my 30 years of viewing BET, I have never witnessed such a cold, calculated execution of murder in primetime&#8230;&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>appears to be divorcing the shooting from its context, concentrating on Rihanna as the agent and perpetrator of a crime, rather than as the victim of one. This wilfully ignores one of the video&#8217;s central messages, which is the ease with which these roles can be merged.</p>
<p>Sex and violence, and sexual violence, as themes in art and entertainment are as old as art and entertainment themselves. To be flippant for a second: maybe it&#8217;s just the use of the word ‘Mama’, but the chorus of &#8216;Man Down&#8217; put me in mind of that certain section of <a href="http://youtu.be/irp8CNj9qBI"><strong>Bohemian Rhapsody</strong></a> where the narrator, having just killed a man, ruminates on how &#8216;life had just begun and now I&#8217;ve gone and thrown it all away&#8217;. And while I don’t think Freddie Mercury was ever actively described as a positive role model, neither was he castigated for encouraging cold-blooded cod-operatic executions among 1970s youth.</p>
<p>Is Rihanna coming in for particular criticism because of the publicity previously given to her real-life encounters with violence? Those of you following along at home will of course have noticed that she didn’t respond to her experience of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/nov/04/rihanna-chris-brown">assault</a> by shooting Chris Brown on the concourse of Grand Central Station. Surely no one seriously believes ‘Man Down’ to be advocating that the victims of violence engage in violent reprisals &#8211; any more than that was true of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103074/"><strong>Thelma &#038; Louise</strong></a>, or  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067800/"><strong>Straw Dogs</strong></a>, or, to really stretch the analogy, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_and_the_Maiden_(play)"><strong>Death and the Maiden</strong></a>? &#8216;Man Down&#8217; is, on one level, a revenge fantasy which relies on the dramatic and the sensational to get its message across.</p>
<p>Roger Ebert <a href="http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20030314/REVIEWS/303140303/1023">wrote of <strong>Irréversible</strong></a>, whose backwards chronology ‘Man Down’ recalls, that the film&#8217;s structure makes it inherently moral &#8211; that by presenting the vengeance before the acts that inspire it, we are forced to process the vengeance first, and therefore think more deeply about its implications. Might the same apply to ‘Man Down’? Throughout the lyrics and video, the song&#8217;s protagonist may contextualise and explain her actions, but she&#8217;s not free of regret, she isn&#8217;t gleeful or exultant, and she acknowledges her actions as a crime with implications for the rest of her life. She calls herself a ‘criminal’ and reflects that her rapist and victim was ‘somebody’s son’. The narrative doesn&#8217;t glorify murder, but it recognises that we live in a world where this kind of fantasy-vigilante approach might often seem more accessible and plausible than relying for justice on the state or the police.</p>
<p>Art and entertainment don&#8217;t exist in a vacuum. Art will be asked to justify itself, particularly when it touches on themes that are an everyday reality for many of us and which feed into issues like the space which women, particularly women of colour, have to express themselves, and the perpetuation of negative stereotypes versus the impetus, the desire, and perhaps the moral duty, to openly discuss the conditions under which we live.</p>
<p>The complex intersections of race and gender hardly lend themselves to being cleared up in the confines of a blog post, but ‘Man Down’ has sparked plenty of engaged and informative discussion online – at <a href="http://crunkfeministcollective.wordpress.com/2011/06/02/man-down-on-rihanna-rape-and-violence/">Crunk Feminist</a>, <a href="http://thebeautifulstruggler.com/2011/06/rihannas-man-down-sparks-absurd-controversy/">The Beautiful Struggler</a>, and <a href="http://hellobeautiful.com/hellobeautiful-original/arielcrockett/rihanna-man-down-video-double-standard/">Hello Beautiful </a> for starters. I&#8217;m just glad debate is happening and that we have a mainstream artist who doesn&#8217;t shy away from instigating it.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A mere three years after she started out, and after just seventeen weeks of her second album at Number One, it appears to have suddenly dawned on Richard Russell that Adele exemplifies all that’s healthy and hopeful in the otherwise dire and overheated state of contemporary pop.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Poor old millionaire superstar <strong>Adele</strong>, eh? No sooner has the dust settled on the furore over her <a href="http://politicalscrapbook.net/2011/05/adele-tax-brit-school/">objections</a> to being a higher-rate taxpayer, than she gets thrown into the vanguard of another of those putative Real Women in Music revolutions. A mere three years after she started out, and after just seventeen weeks of her second album at Number One, it appears to have suddenly dawned on Richard Russell that Adele exemplifies <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/may/29/adele-change-women-music-business">all that’s healthy and hopeful</a> in the otherwise dire and overheated state of contemporary pop.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The whole message with [Adele] is that it&#8217;s just music, it&#8217;s just really good music,&#8221; said Russell. &#8220;There is nothing else. There are no gimmicks, no selling of sexuality. I think in the American market, particularly, they have come to the conclusion that is what you have to do.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/21Adele.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="5872" data-permalink="/2011/06/01/can-adele-and-her-marketing-men-change-the-face-of-women-in-music/21adele/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/21Adele.jpg?fit=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="300,300" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="21Adele" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/21Adele.jpg?fit=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/21Adele.jpg?fit=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5872" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/21Adele.jpg?resize=240%2C240" alt="cover art for Adele's second album 21, featuring a black and white facial photographic portrait of the singer, a young white woman with long fair hair, with her eyes closed as if lost in thought" width="240" height="240" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/21Adele.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/21Adele.jpg?w=150&amp;ssl=1 150w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>The main reason why Russell’s claims about Adele should be regarded with scepticism is that Russell is the head of Adele’s record label. Even leaving aside such vested interests, his argument that she represents some kind of paradigm shift has been ably deconstructed <a href="http://www.laurasnapes.co.uk/on-why-adele-isnt-quite-the-groundbreaking-paradigm-richard-russell-thinks-she-is/">here</a> by Laura Snapes.</p>
<p>The <strong>Guardian </strong>article linked to above has a few frustrating facets of its own. I’m not sure why Rihanna’s &#8216;S&amp;M&#8217; should be hoicked in to illustrate Russell’s point: there’s a difference between having a sexualised image – usually, when it&#8217;s the subject of criticism, one that’s been externally imposed on an artist – and singing about sex and sexuality. Especially when &#8216;S&amp;M&#8217; is a more complex song than that framework allows for &#8211; arguably one in which Rihanna presents non-mainstream sexuality in terms of female agency. Finally, the idea of good-girl, sexless Adele vs bad-girl, sexualised Rihanna is a false dichotomy with problems in abundance.</p>
<p>Adele’s own image is hardly free of contrivance, harking back as it does to the blue-eyed soul divas of the 1960s &#8211; classily sexualised, perhaps, but sexualised nonetheless. In her chosen brand of popular music, a degree of sex in your self-presentation is, as Russell correctly identifies, inextricably linked to commercial success. It’s even arguable, unfortunately, that it’s Adele’s very distance from the currently acceptable aesthetic norms of her genre that has necessitated she be marketed with a different, &#8216;desexualised&#8217; focus. Had Adele possessed her own voice but the body of, oh, let&#8217;s say Katy Perry, would her image have been sexed-up business as usual?</p>
<p>Russell is taking issue, of course, not with the marketing and self-presentation of all women in music, but with a particular branch of commercial pop, and the marketing therein of female artists by predominantly male management, which was ever thus. If his comments do kickstart a new way of measuring the money-making potential of women in music, then great, but it&#8217;s going to be an uphill struggle in view of the constant and increasing pressures on female performers &#8211; as well as male &#8211; to conform to a blandly beautiful industry standard.</p>
<p>Is Adele&#8217;s refusal to bow to that standard, as Russell claims, as radical today as the Prodigy were in the early 1990s? Let’s face it, mainstream acts are so limp and colourless right now, and popular culture so devoid of ideas, experiments and imagination, that yeah, it probably is. Never mind that the Prodigy were highly politicised and engaged with a wider oppositional culture, while Adele is outspoken in bemoaning her tax burden.</p>
<p>While no one can begrudge Adele her success, or deny that it&#8217;s refreshing to witness, the fact that she can be said to occupy a radical position is more an indictment of contemporary music than it is a compliment to her. The most positive thing about Russell&#8217;s remarks is the opportunity they offer to reiterate a greater truth: that commercial profit-driven pap purely designed to generate a profit is more than socio-culturally damaging for women, it’s dull.</p>

<p>We like it when people we think are cool come out as feminists, or even just express views broadly in line with feminist ideas. It makes  us feel cool. And if we can&#8217;t feel cool, we don&#8217;t wanna be part of the  revolution. More seriously, it&#8217;s important to celebrate that folk come  to feminism through all sorts of different routes and in their own time.</p>
<p>Whenever a person has a feminist revelation of the sort that we might think is obvious (such as the lack of good female role models in certain music genres), instead of going &#8220;well, duh?!&#8221; and getting cross, here at BR Towers we go &#8220;hey, yeah! Grab a drink and join the party.&#8221;</p>
<p>First up, <a href="http://en.academic.ru/dic.nsf/enwiki/309843">Jade Puget</a>, guitarist for chart-topping emo-punksters <a href="http://www.afireinside.net/">AFI</a> and one half  of EBM/dance project <a href="http://www.blaqkaudio.com/splash/">Blaqk Audio</a>, realises there are <a href="http://shyboyswin.blogspot.com/2010/06/i-was-reading-one-of-my.html">barely any women in  his beloved electronica</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>I was reading one of my computer/electronic music  nerd alert magazines  today and I noticed that every one of these acclaimed electronic  producers is male. I realized that the electronic music scene is almost  completely male-dominated. &#8230;. we need a lady-led revolution in the  scene, girls making ill breakbeat  hardcore, wobbly dubstep basslines, 20 minute psybient epics.</p></blockquote>
<p>Next, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayley_Williams">Hayley Williams</a>, lead singer in chart-topping emo-pop-rockers <a href="http://www.paramore.net/">Paramore</a>, declares that<a href="http://yelyahwilliams.tumblr.com/post/3515761303/after-finishing-charlie-chaplins-own-story"> she&#8217;s researching Riot Grrrl</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>After finishing “Charlie Chaplin’s Own Story”.. I’m currently reading <a href="http://www.girlstothefront.com/"> this book</a>. Mostly to satisfy my thirst for knowledge on the Riot Grrrl  Movement in the 90’s and bands such as Bikini Kill and Bratmobile. But  I’m finding more and more that I wish my 13 year old self could’ve read  it. Girls, women, ladies: check it out!</p></blockquote>
<p>Both posts may have been up a little while, but finding them at the same time brought a smile.  I love that both of these excerpts reveal the demand for women past and present in the music business, and that rather than merely noting absences they are positive calls for action, alongside ways to get involved.</p>
