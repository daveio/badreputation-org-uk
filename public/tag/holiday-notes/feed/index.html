										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ah, summer holidays. Bringing with them the many body-related tribulations of trying to get on in life in the face of ridiculous social conventions on how you should look (yes, thank you very much <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/07/19/found-feminism-how-i-stopped-worrying-and-learned-to-say-no-to-the-special-k-lady/">Special K Lady</a> and your Cohorts of Doom). With the annual Revelation Of The Flesh comes a more recent addition to the pile of what Caitlin Moran might term ABSOLUTE BULLSHIT.</p>

<p>The puerile association between a woman&#8217;s choice of tattoo placement and her sexual availability. AKA the <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=tramp+stamp">Tramp Stamp</a>. I hate that word. I hate it as a woman who has many tattoos and is bored rigid of all the shitty comments from the Morally Uptight Brigade about how ink looks &#8220;common&#8221; or &#8220;trashy&#8221; on women (and it&#8217;s almost always about women), how I&#8217;ll hate it when I get older, which is another dull reminder of how once we&#8217;ve lost our looks we&#8217;re for the bonfire of other people&#8217;s vanities.</p>
<p>But worse is the fact that tattoos, <a href="http://tattoo.about.com/od/tattoosgeneralinfo/a/tramp_stamp.htm">particularly this placement</a>, have been added to the ever mounting list of Reasons Why Women Are Sluts. <a href="http://slutmeansspeakup.org.uk/">We marched for this, people</a>!</p>
<p>A quick scroll around the internet reveals the extent of the problem. Over 2 million results on Google for the term &#8220;tramp stamp&#8221; alone. Top hit is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_back_tattoo">the Wikipedia article</a> which doesn&#8217;t even try to assert any form of anti-sexism editing beyond the coy reference to &#8220;lower back tattoo&#8221;, which I initially applauded until I saw the bare bottom shots used in the article. There are pages and pages devoted to <a href="http://www.heavy.com/comedy/2010/02/the-20-worst-tramp-stamps/">deriding these tattoos</a>, and the <a href="http://trampstampnation.net/girls-with-tramp-stamps/">women who have them</a>. So far, so bad.</p>
<p>The litmus test is whether the chaps get tarred with the same brush. Seems not. They may well have tattoos in this place (it&#8217;s a good bit of skin to get inked) but they&#8217;re apparently doing it for the<a href="http://typophile.com/node/52779"> irony factor</a>. Or, poor thing, <a href="http://culturegarage.com/article/bmw_driver_does_pain_killers_booze_and_ends_up_with_tramp_stamp/">by accident</a>.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I&#8217;m not denying that some of these tattoos are ugly, silly or plain ridiculous. I&#8217;m very fussy about my tattoos and I love each one to bits almost as much as I love <a href="http://ugliesttattoos.failblog.org/">bitching about crap ones</a>. Tattoos are a matter of personal taste, not a flag declaring whether or not I want to sleep with you: if you pour scorn and sexist drivel on my ink, then I definitely don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Tramp stamp &#8211; another phrase that we can probably do without. Agreed?</p>
