										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This year, as many of us fill in the census, it&#8217;s also 100 years since the <a href="http://www.1911census.co.uk/">1911 census</a>, which women&#8217;s suffrage activists saw as another campaigning opportunity.</em></p>
<p>One of the best and oddest moments in the Disney canon is the appearance, halfway through <strong>Mary Poppins</strong>, of an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sister_Suffragette">all-singing all-dancing campaign for civil liberties</a>. &#8216;Sister Suffragette&#8217; isn&#8217;t without its problems – the song is half-pisstake, half-pastiche, and the film makes Mrs Banks’ dizzy preoccupation with Votes for Women another instance of parental neglect – but come on, it’s a subversively fluffy aside that puts a smile on the face, and it’s sometimes the first encounter with that fabulous creature, a suffragette, that people remember having.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_suffrage_in_the_United_Kingdom">campaign for women’s suffrage in this country</a> is such a great story that I’m surprised it’s never been the subject of its own Disney film. Apart from its narrative of struggle towards a goal undeniably justified in modern eyes, it’s got a whole array of glamorous heroines in petticoats and picture-hats and, eventually – after the false dawn of the 1918 Representation of the People Act which only included women property-owners aged over thirty – a happy ending. In particular, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_Social_and_Political_Union">Suffragette</a> taste for militantly iconoclastic protest would lend itself to iconic on-screen moments: women chained to the Downing Street railings, smashing windows, <a href="http://www.heritage-images.com/Preview/PreviewPage.aspx?id=1192504&#038;pricing=true&#038;licenseType=RM">occupying civic buildings</a>, enduring imprisonment and force-feeding and, not least, <strong>Emily Wilding Davison</strong>’s much-disputed martyrdom at the social event of the season, which actually was captured <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhF7NUNuZwA" target="_blank">on film</a> at the time.</p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="425" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/NARvfwx2oIQ?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Contrary to the Pathé News intertitle, Davison was not killed by her collision with George V’s horse at the 1913 Epsom Derby, but died four days later of the injuries sustained. She was forty. When people say women died for your right to vote, a fair proportion of them will be thinking of her.</p>
<p>Davison’s intentions on the day of the Derby are lost to history. Some historians believe her to have been intent on martyrdom, pointing to a previous incident during her imprisonment in<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strangeways_Prison"> Strangeways</a> where she threw herself off a balcony. On the other hand, the fact that she had purchased a return train ticket &#8211; and also a ticket to a suffragette dance later that day &#8211; suggests that she intended to return having only interrupted or disrupted the race – possibly by attaching a suffragette flag to the King&#8217;s horse. This would have been one more instance of Davison’s dedication to gaining attention for her chosen cause through publicity stunt and spectacle.</p>

Sylvia Pankhurst recalled her as &#8216;tall and slender&#8230; Her illusive, whimsical green eyes and thin, half-smiling mouth, bore often the mocking expression of the Mona Lisa&#8217;. She performed well at school, and defying many of the social orthodoxies imposed by Victorian society, won a place at Royal Holloway College, funding her own education through teaching work. In 1895 she studied for a term at Oxford, gaining First Class Honours in Modern Languages – despite, Oxford degrees being closed to women, having no opportunity to graduate. Having resumed her teaching career, Davison joined the Women&#8217;s Social and Political Union in 1906, quickly becoming its head steward as well as an active member of the socialist Workers&#8217; Educational Association and the Central Labour College.</p>
<p>Davison was one of around a thousand women imprisoned for political activities between 1903 and the outbreak of WWI. In March 1909, she was arrested for disturbance while attempting to hand a petition to the Liberal Prime Minister Herbert Asquith, and sentenced to one month in prison. Four months later, she attempted to gain access to a hall where the Chancellor of the Exchequer, David Lloyd George, was giving a speech, and was imprisoned for two months. Later in the same year, she and two other women were arrested for throwing stones at Lloyd George’s car, and sentenced to a month’s hard labour at Strangeways prison. The stones were wrapped in paper bearing Emily&#8217;s favourite saying: <em>Rebellion against tyrants is obedience to God.</em></p>
<p>While inside Strangeways, Davison went on hunger-strike. The prison authorities, <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Whunger.htm">in line with government policy</a>, responded by force-feeding her and, when she barricaded herself inside her cell to avoid this, came close to causing her death by flooding the cell with ice-cold water. This treatment appalled the public and was discussed in Parliament, with Labour leader <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Hardie">James Keir Hardie</a> advocating her release. Undaunted, Davison spent the next few years in and out of prison for setting fire to London post boxes, attacking a vicar she mistook for Lloyd George, and planting a bomb which severely damaged Lloyd George&#8217;s house in Surrey.</p>

<p>The public response to Davison’s death at the Epsom Derby was not immediately sympathetic: more information was printed about the health of the King’s horse and jockey (the latter making a full recovery and the former ‘suffering bruised shins’) than about the suffragettes’ cause, and the Daily Herald went on to print <a href="http://www.unb.ca/democracy/English/Ideas/Consent/Civil/ImagesDisobedience/cartoon1.jpg">a cartoon in dubious taste showing ‘Miss Davison’ as a skeleton holding a Votes For Women placard</a>. Posterity has been scarcely kinder, dismissing Davison as a mentally ill fanatic and proto-terrorist whose actions horrified both supporters and opponents of her cause, and which enabled the persistence of old arguments founded on the idea that women’s intrinsically irrational nature made them unsuited to political discourse and decision-making. Populist historian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Strange_Death_of_Liberal_England">George Dangerfield</a>’s depiction of the suffragettes as a frivolous frilly edge to the fall of Liberal England was a cue picked up by succeeding historians, who viewed the majority of women involved as playing at politics, succumbing to a fashionably edgy craze, indulging their innate feminine tendency to hysteria, and even masochistically courting the treatment they received from police and prison authorities. Not until the advent of women’s history in the 1970s were they treated more seriously and their struggle linked to that for wider suffrage in earlier decades: the first Woman&#8217;s Suffrage Bill was presented to Parliament in 1832, as part of the general struggle for reform and extension of the franchise to non-property-holding and working men. (It&#8217;s worth pointing out that the King&#8217;s jockey at the 1913 Derby, Herbert Jones, was not entitled to the vote either.) </p>

<p>Davison is buried at Morpeth Church with the WSPU motto ‘Deeds Not Words’ engraved on her headstone. Memorials to her are hard to find – like the suffragette monument <a href="http://exploringlondon.wordpress.com/2011/01/26/curious-london-memorials-4-the-suffragette-memorial/">tucked away in Victoria</a> – but one is in the House of Commons crypt, placed there by the Labour MP Tony Benn. It commemorates the night of the 1911 census when Davison hid in a cupboard in the Palace of Westminster overnight so that on the census form she could legitimately give ‘the House of Commons’ as her place of residence that night. (Ironically enough, other suffragettes were spending the night <a href="http://hwj.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2011/02/21/hwj.dbq064.full">evading the census</a> in protest at their exclusion from the franchise.) The census documents from 2nd April 1911 state that Davison was found &#8216;hiding in the crypt&#8217; in the Houses of Parliament. Whatever the suffragettes’ brand of protest represents today – a reckless eye for spectacle, a disregard for personal safety and security in pursuit of political goals, and a willingness to draw attention to oneself, all of which are valid weapons in the arsenal of political activists – escapades like that of Emily Davison on census night are the kind of minor gems that make the historical record sparkle.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">NANNY</h2>
<h3><strong>Sonic Nurse</strong></h3>
<p>After the army of Important Academic Languages, and their Distinguished And Layered Relationship With Modern English, we reach this. <em>N</em><em>anny </em>has no real relation to Latin, Greek, French, Middle or even Old English, but derives from &#8216;a child&#8217;s corruption of the word <em>nurse</em>&#8216;, tellingly akin to <em>mamma</em>. <em>Nurse</em>, it must be granted,<em> </em>has slightly more pedigree: it derives from the twelfth-century Old French term <em>norrice</em>,<em> </em>via the Latin <em>nutricius </em>(=<em> </em>&#8216;that suckles, nourishes&#8217;). It<em> </em>first appears in 1530 as a verb &#8216;to suckle&#8217;, and as a noun fifty years later, where it has the meaning we probably use most often: &#8216;one who takes care of the sick&#8217;.</p>

<p><em>Nanny</em> is first cited as an independent word meaning &#8216;a child&#8217;s nurse-maid&#8217; in 1795, whence it proves itself as fluid as you would expect, also encompassing a quasi-proper name, <em>Nana</em> (Cf. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUhwA-C-ACg">Katy Nana</a> in <strong>Mary Poppins</strong>, and the Newfoundland dog in <strong>Peter Pan</strong>). In 1830s America, we meet another deviant form of the same idea: <em>mammy,</em> a dialect corruption of <em>mamma</em> referring to &#8216;a black woman who looks after white children&#8217;. In extended form, <em>mammy </em>refers to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammy_archetype">racial stereotype</a>: &#8216;the loud, overweight and good natured black woman&#8217;, epitomised (in proper name form) in <strong>Gone With The Wind</strong>, and controversially brought to life in an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92kLpKuRJfo">Oscar-winning performance</a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hattie_McDaniel">Hattie McDaniel</a> (above, right). And it&#8217;s not all the Americans: this phenomenon has certain similarities to the British use of native women as nursemaids in colonial India, <em>ayah</em>s, so named in reference to the Hindi word meaning &#8216;nurse&#8217;.</p>
<h3>Dude Ranch Nurse</h3>
<p>All this leads back to one place: the whistleblowing potential of an <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/11/29/an-alphabet-of-femininism-9-i-is-for-infant/">infant&#8217;s cries</a>, in this instance naming the truly maternal figure in their formative years. But then, of course, until the late eighteenth century (the nineteenth, in France), no fashionable woman would even consider nursing her own child: on the contrary, <em>wet nursing </em>(sending your kid out to be suckled by a hired breast) was so common as to be automatic. Newborns were generally sent away for up to two years to be <em>nourished</em>, at a rate of anything from a few shillings a week to between £25 &#8211; 50 a year.</p>
<p>The reasons were as varied as the price, spanning the apparently trivial (social custom, and the desire to return to public life ASAP); the medical (fears for the mother&#8217;s health after the strain of lying in <em>sans </em>twenty-first century advantages), and the &#8216;medical&#8217; (the widespread notion that sex with a nursing woman would damage her milk and therefore the child, and the belief that conception was impossible during this time anyway). It also seems possible that rampant infant mortality may have contributed: parents would send their children away until they had survived their most dangerous years, rather than invest emotional energy in a little&#8217;un who might well leave you before their first birthday.</p>
<p>That said, the enduring influence of the nanny <em>qua</em> mother-figure lasted long into the twentieth century, albeit mostly among the mega-aristocracy: <strong>The King&#8217;s Speech </strong>(2011) imagines the future George VI to have been closer to his nannies than his family; one of these, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Bill">Charlotte Bill</a>, was famously also an effective mother to his autistic and epileptic younger brother, Johnny (re-created in the 2003 BBC serial <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lost_Prince">The Lost Prince</a></strong>).</p>

<p>The women who actually did all this nursing were inevitably of a lower social class than their clients – if not a different race – although they could earn good money (and possibly a nice pension) in the process. Here we tumble into a parallel nanny universe: the word in its more formal sense originating from another <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/10/25/an-alphabet-of-femininism-4-d-is-for-doll/">proper name</a><em>. </em>Through a bit of shuffling, good old <em>Ann</em> became first <em>Nan</em> and then <em>Nanny</em>, in which incarnation, around 1788, the word came to simply connote femininity, as in <em>Nanny-goat </em>(= &#8216;a female goat&#8217;, on which see also &#8216;Jenny Wren&#8217; and &#8216;jenny-ass&#8217;). Like <em>Doll</em>, Nan&#8217;s trajectory suggests commonness, generic feminine identity, and while the dictionary is specific on the two <em>nannies</em>&#8216; separation, its stated origin in an infant&#8217;s mouth is by definition uncertain, language development fluid, and the connections between milking and the farmyard in need of little exposition – compare the nineteenth-century term <em>baby farmer</em>, a lower-class wet nurse happy to let her charges die because her one-off fee encouraged little else. The term was always pejorative, and synonymous with the dangerous, non-nurturing female.</p>
<p>In contrast, we have the <em>nannies </em>who stayed with one family for generations (like the <em>mammy</em> and the <em>ayah </em>abroad): these last are inevitably conventionally &#8216;older&#8217; than their baby-farming colleagues, and presumably played a more extended mothering role. It is these strange insider-outsiders who appear in literature as bawdy and decrepit old women, inevitably depicted as their job title suggests: firmly on the side of the children they raise, to the extent that they will happily aid their improper sexual dalliances. It is thus that the <em>Nurse</em> appears in <strong>Romeo and Juliet</strong>, and in Keats&#8217; <strong>The Eve of St. Agnes</strong>. The suspicion inevitably directed at these figures is certainly class-based: wet nursing&#8217;s detractors had been arguing for years that by withholding mothers&#8217; milk parents risked their children absorbing working-class mannerisms – and criminal tendencies – from their surrogate teats.</p>
<h3>Na na na na na.</h3>
<p>The next stop for the <em>nanny </em>is in the inter-war years, with representatives including P.L. Travers&#8217; <strong>Mary Poppins</strong>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Now_We_Are_Six">poems </a>of A. A. Milne, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noel_Streatfeild">Noel Streatfeild</a>&#8216;s legion of sexless &#8216;cottage loaf&#8217; Nanas. Streatfeild&#8217;s children are almost invariably orphaned, and their Nana-figure keeps them nourished through &#8216;nursery ways&#8217;, a stubborn lack of sentimentality, and a feeling of permanence sadly lacking in the increasingly fragmented world of war-torn Britain. A similar idea is repeated in the 1964 Disney film of Travers&#8217; novel, which makes the significant decision to backdate events to 1910, when the focus is on &#8216;moulding the breed&#8217; for future colonial greatness:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIamxYhVfnI">A British nanny must be a general! </a><br />
The future empire lies within her hands.<br />
And so the person that we need<br />
To mould the breed<br />
Is a nanny who can give commands!</p>
<p>Walt Disney&#8217;s <strong>Mary Poppins </strong>(1964)</p></blockquote>
<p>In so doing, Disney&#8217;s film situates the<em> nanny </em>as part of &#8216;tradition, discipline and rules&#8217;, nurturing Britain&#8217;s future rather than its children, and flying in the face of its very etymology.</p>
<p>Mr Banks&#8217; song does, however, lead us to the final stop on <em>nanny&#8217;</em>s childishly simple word-journey: its modern incarnation as the Dreaded <em>Nanny State </em>(first appearing some time between the fifties and sixties). Always an opprobrious term (<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4044815.stm">attempts to re-appropriate it</a> have met with derision)  critics of government intervention ranging from the welfare state to the smoking ban hark back to the <em>nanny </em>to point up &#8216;mollycoddling&#8217;, the infantalisation of the people (who are presumably thus reduced to the baby-talk of the nursery) returning to <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=F3vwrJQWukUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false">childhood with a fussy female at the helm</a>. Wash your face, dearie.</p>
