										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was walking home recently, across a busy bit of central London, after dark, when some dude made kissy noises at me, like he was trying to tempt a cat. He was two feet away, staring straight at me and smirking like an icky weasel.</p>
<p>Without thinking, I responded in kind with a big, angry, <em>I-will-slash-you</em> hiss.</p>

DESIST</p></div>
<p>He looked pretty taken aback.</p>
<p>I carried on my way and mused that I appear to speak feline like a mothertongue, but also I got to thinking: what the ever-loving crap?! Seriously, what on earth was he expecting from that encounter? What would a positive result have been? Surely that&#8217;s <em>never</em> worked for anyone, right?</p>
<p>Ah, street harassment. It&#8217;s been a few months. Usually my experience of you is relegated to when I&#8217;m wearing a summer dress (gender norms for the lose) but it sucks whenever it happens. It&#8217;s also antithetical to ever actually <em>getting</em> my interest because &#8211; no matter how many mad cat-lady vibes I&#8217;ve got going on &#8211; no one who thinks they can approach me like a pet is getting the time of day.</p>
<p>This particular encounter didn&#8217;t throw me much because I actually had a comeback &#8211; I walked away pleased with myself for thinking fast &#8211; but how you deflect it shouldn&#8217;t be the first point of call. WHY DO PEOPLE DO THIS?</p>
<p>Far more often it&#8217;s crap shouted from cars &#8211; which I find rubbish twice over because they&#8217;ve gone before you can say or do anything in response. (Come back right now, dudebro. I have a LOT to say about what you just did.)</p>
<p>A friend of mine recently had some jerk shout &#8220;nice tits!&#8221; at her from a car. She was (understandably) angry and upset for the rest of the day, but the guy shouting it might have told himself it was a compliment &#8211; some <a title="Jezebel article video with W. Kamau bell talking to cat-callers" href="http://jezebel.com/5955644/fgeryterr5yjhytjw-kamau-bell-hits-the-streets-to-ask-whats-so-wrong-with-a-little-cat-calling?tag=street-harassment">interviews with street harassers</a> have revealed what is either complete ignorance or willing ignorance of the effect it has on women. Many of the men, when asked why they do it, say it&#8217;s a compliment and it makes women feel nice.</p>
<p>Maybe it is a compliment for a very small percentage of people &#8211; I cannot claim to speak for everybody &#8211; but I am yet to meet or hear of one person who&#8217;s had a catcall, wolf-whistle or similar and felt good about it. The thing about street harassment is, it&#8217;s not flirting. Street harassment doesn&#8217;t make a person feel good because it isn&#8217;t about a person: it&#8217;s boiling them down to their physical attributes (&#8216;nice tits&#8217;, &#8216;nice ass&#8217;) and funnily enough that doesn&#8217;t feel great.</p>

<p>The other thing is, it&#8217;s almost never a conversation: mostly &#8217;cause the objects of the harassment <strong>aren&#8217;t interested</strong> and want to get on with their day, and also because often it&#8217;s at a remove &#8211; stuff shouted from cars, or (to use the cliché) from scaffolding. The people doing the shouting don&#8217;t actually expect a response. This isn&#8217;t a tool used to chat up women: it&#8217;s used to silence them. Under the guise of a compliment it&#8217;s a one-way street of objectification.</p>
<p>And Objectification Street is a crappy street. Seriously, I looked at a flat there once. There were rats all over the place and it smelled bad.</p>
<p>Of course, if people are physically closer to the harassers, it doesn&#8217;t exactly get better. The wonderful (and award-winning) Anti-Street Harassment UK campaign (<a title="anti street harassment uk" href="http://www.smk.org.uk/london-social-justice-2011/">ASH UK</a>) was set up after its founder, Vicky, was harassed by a group of men who were initially shouting at her from a car, <strong>threatened to rape her</strong>, then got out of the car and followed her into a tube station where they assaulted her. The police (who did intervene) then blamed her for responding to them and said &#8220;boys will be boys.&#8221; <strong>SO. MUCH. FAIL.</strong></p>
<p>Um&#8230; *cough* male readers &#8211; this is essentially Met officers saying your entire gender are all hopeless gropey asshats. Erm&#8230; *cough* I wouldn&#8217;t take that.</p>
<h3>So, what can we do?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Well, the first step is breaking down the idea that it&#8217;s either normal or OK. It&#8217;s neither, and we need to spread the word. Thou shalt not take shit, and (not that our readers should need telling) thou shalt not dish it out, either.</li>
<li>Read up on it &#8211; from the likes of <a title="stop street harassment.org" href="http://www.stopstreetharassment.org/strategies/bystander-responses/"><strong>stopstreetharassment.org</strong></a> to this brilliant <a title="" href="http://www.rhrealitycheck.org/blog/2010/05/05/video-walking-homefilm-about-street-harassment-among-women-color">video on street harassment and women of colour</a>:</li>
</ul>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/D2Qpi-fW6jA" frameborder="0" width="480" height="360"></iframe></p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Check out <a title="Jezebel street harassment" href="http://jezebel.com/street-harassment/">Jezebel&#8217;s ongoing street harassment category</a>, and call catcalling out for the asshattery it is.</li>
<li>Those who want some background on why people are often hostile to approaches on the street would do very well to read this blog post <a title="Schrödinger’s Rapist: or a guy’s guide to approaching strange women without being maced" href="http://kateharding.net/2009/10/08/guest-blogger-starling-schrodinger%E2%80%99s-rapist-or-a-guy%E2%80%99s-guide-to-approaching-strange-women-without-being-maced/">&#8216;Schrödinger&#8217;s Rapist&#8217;</a>. (Heavy, but a thousand times worth it.)</li>
<li>And in the meantime, don&#8217;t let that &#8216;compliment&#8217; strawman argument derail you on your quest for gender justice.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h3>On that note&#8230;</h3>
<p>&#8230; since you&#8217;ve been such a good class of gender justice warriors today, I&#8217;m going to let you finish early with just one more video:</p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/5P4eVjwVd_U?wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" width="450" height="390"></iframe></p>
<p>I absolutely love their line of questioning about &#8220;has that ever worked for you?&#8221; Also &#8220;sweetheart, please stop perpetuating the patriarchial dividend &#8211; it&#8217;s <em>so</em> over&#8221; should be on a t-shirt. I would buy that shirt.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s a wrap. Now, if you&#8217;ll excuse me, I need to go back to more important things &#8211; like buying cat food for my wonderful kitty &#8211; because some catcalls are nice. The ones that come from an actual cat.<sup><a href="/2012/12/05/street-harassment-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-loving-cat-noises-when-they-come-from-creepy-dudes/#footnote_0_12772" id="identifier_0_12772" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" Not Schr&ouml;dinger&rsquo;s cat.
