					<description><![CDATA[Like most of the Disney Renaissance heroines, hers is the story of a successful transition from the rule of the father to the rule of the husband. But how did we get to something so squeaky-clean? ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li><em><strong>Ed&#8217;s Note:</strong> This post is partly in honour of <a href="http://poemsunderwater.wordpress.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Poems Underwater</strong></a>, a new project on the symbolism of the mermaid our Hodge is involved with, which you are hereby urged to check out (and perhaps <a href="http://poemsunderwater.wordpress.com/contribute/" target="_blank">contribute</a> to, as it has a zine and everything!).</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Released in 1989, Disney’s <strong>The Little Mermaid</strong> heralded the start of the ‘Disney Renaissance’ – a period of critical and commercial success that followed a rocky patch where the studio’s prime focus had been on Disneyland attractions rather than feature films.</p>
<p>It was soundtracked by <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/beauty-and-the-plague" target="_blank">Broadway golden boy Howard Ashman</a>, who changed the planned English butler crab into a Jamaican crustacean named Sebastian, and reworked the film’s structure to more closely align with that of a Broadway musical. He also decided to base Ursula the Sea Witch on drag artist and disco star <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_(performer)" target="_blank">Divine</a> (who died whilst the film was still in production).</p>
<p>Ashman died of AIDS two years later, in March 1991, but his musical influence, first on <b>Mermaid</b>, and subsequently on <strong>Beauty and the Beast</strong> and <strong>Aladdin</strong>, was a major factor in the regeneration of the studio in the early nineties. <strong>Mermaid</strong> won Oscar gongs for Best Song and Best Score, the first Oscar nod for Disney since the Seventies.</p>
<h2>Mermaids of the Eighties</h2>

<p>The Disney studio had been considering Hans Christian Andersen’s <b>The Little Mermaid </b>for adaptation as early as the <strong>Snow White</strong> years, but it was not until the late Eighties that the time finally seemed right. Even then, there was concern it might too closely duplicate <b>Splash</b>, which Disney had produced in 1984.</p>
<p><strong>Splash</strong> itself had been rushed through production because there were rumours of another mermaid film in the pipeline elsewhere – a Warren Beatty vehicle that eventually fell through. Why exactly mermaids were suddenly in the ascendant during this particular period of the late twentieth century is open to speculation; at any rate, the nudity and adult content in <strong>Splash</strong> led directly to the creation of Touchstone Pictures, Disney’s ‘older audiences’ label. Mermaids (particularly Darryl Hannah&#8217;s mermaid) were too sexual for the family studio in 1984.</p>
<p>Ironically, of course, <em>mermaid</em> &#8211; “maiden of the sea” – suggests that these aquatic women are rather more virginal than ‘Touchstone Pictures’ thought. Traditional (cisnormative) misogynistic popular wisdom holds women in general to be ‘leaky vessels’, because of the amount of ‘moisture’ they produce, but though mermaids live in the water, they have no apparent human genitalia, making them, by contrast, vessels that are rather neatly sealed.</p>
<p>In this, they link with the Virgin Mary, who appears in Catholic symbolism as a ‘fountain forever sealed’ in the middle of an enclosed garden, representing the Immaculate Conception. Mary’s homonymic (and virginal) association with mermaids, and the link between the sea (<em>mer</em>) and the mother (<em>mere</em>) introduces an additional layer to this.</p>
<p>Alongside this, there is also a parallel virgin/whore tradition of the mermaid as prostitute and even embodied vagina (since, famously, vaginas are often described as smelling like fish).</p>

<p>This opposing strand presumably comes from sailors’ fear of the Siren-figure and the unknowns out in the sea, but it’s also connected with a different type of mermaid altogether – the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/patia/2610080360/" target="_blank">melusine</a>. A double-tailed half-woman, half-fish, her intrinsic, though hidden, fishiness only emerges when she takes a bath. Even then, the double tail leaves her human genitalia open to the world in what <a href="http://www.endicott-studio.com/jMA03Summer/theMermaid.html">some have claimed</a> is an appropriation of older symbols of female fertility, such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheela_na_gig">Sheela na gig</a> or even the goddess Venus (an alternative ‘mother’ connection).</p>
<p>Incidentally the melusine, not the mermaid, is the figure in the (now closely cropped) logo for Starbucks coffee, the first branch of which opened &#8211; logo blazing proud, bare-breasted and double-tailed &#8211; in 1971, a decade before <strong>Splash</strong> went into production.</p>
<p>The coffee-shop melusine was maintained in her full glory until 1987 (although she was &#8216;sealed&#8217; at the point where the tails meet, <a href="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3129/2610080360_b4d8ba0e2d.jpg" target="_blank">as her original had not been</a>); the first of several censoring crops came into effect around the time Disney bosses turned their attention to Andersen.</p>
<p>For a modern contrast to the &#8216;sealed off&#8217; melusine, have a look at one of the <a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/lynxmermaid3.jpg" target="_blank">mermaids commissioned by men&#8217;s deodorant brand Lynx for an early Noughties advertising campaign</a>, whose posterior is beginning to resurface through her scales, soft porn-like.</p>
<h2>Planning The Little Mermaid</h2>
<p>Hans Christian Andersen’s original <strong>Little Mermaid</strong> tale was serviceable, but – much like Starbucks’ logo – it had to be sanitised before Disney could take it to a Disney audience. Tellingly, the changes proposed during this period of pre-production were substantially same as the ones suggested during the preliminary work in the Thirties.</p>

<p>The first thing to do was give it a happy ending, since in Andersen’s version the Prince’s indifference to the mermaid <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/05/09/fairy-tale-fest-the-best-adaptation-of-the-little-mermaid-ive-ever-seen/" target="_blank">results in her annihilation</a> and transformation to ‘a daughter of the air’.</p>
<p>This was typical Andersen: he wrote that ‘most of what I have written is a reflection of myself’, and he was not a terribly happy man. Unreciprocated love was an ongoing feature of his life, and throughout it he nursed passions for various inappropriate people.</p>
<p>These included celebrity soprano Jenny Lind (who is said to have inspired his story <strong>The Nightingale</strong> after she put him firmly in the friendzone in 1844) and various straight men, but he also wrote of avoiding actual sexual encounters – his diary records him visiting prostitutes, talking to them, and then returning home to masturbate alone.</p>
<p>Many of his ‘fairy tales’ are characterised by violence, speechlessness and unreciprocated love, often across two different ‘species’, as with the tin soldier’s love for a paper ballerina in <strong>The Steadfast Tin Soldier</strong>, or indeed the Little Mermaid’s love for the human Prince – a feature that tends to make them, like their author, rather sexless in approach.</p>
<p>Although the sad stuff was scrapped, the symbolically significant speechlessness of the Mermaid was maintained in the Disney screenplay. A mermaid’s voice is her primary power, since her singing can lure sailors to their deaths, so its loss is a significant one – aphonia in a milder form had also been a feature of <strong>Splash</strong>, where Darryl Hannah’s character cannot initially speak English.</p>
<p>Disney’s Ariel was voiced by Broadway star (and Ashman associate) Jodi Benson, and her voice remains her defining beauty in the film. But the manner of its loss changes: while both Little Mermaids give their voices up to the Sea Witch, in Andersen&#8217;s story the unnamed mermaid has her tongue cut out to bring this about. Disney cleaned this up, and, in the process, rendered it reversible: Ariel’s voice is depicted as a glowing, ghostly ball that can pass through bodily barriers without drawing blood – as in traditional artistic representations of the soul.</p>
<p>Ironically, this is exactly what Andersen’s mermaid is seeking: her love for the prince is the means through which she hopes to win ‘immortality’ and the chance to share in the joys of paradise. (This rather Romantic notion, albeit gender-inverted, links Andersen’s tale thematically with Friedrich de la Motte’s mermaid <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undine_(novella)" target="_blank"><strong>Undine</strong></a> &#8211; and also Tchaikovsky’s watery <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swan_Lake" target="_blank"><strong>Swan Lake</strong></a>, composed in 1875, the year Andersen died). Disney refocused the mermaid&#8217;s longing for a soul to a more secular – and sexualised – teenage quest for the love of a handsome prince.</p>
<h2>She sells sea shells</h2>
<p>But Disney hit a problem when it came to the artwork. Mermaids, of course, are typically bare-breasted, but so too were traditional depictions of Andersen’s ‘little’ mermaid, including the statue in Copenhagen’s harbour.</p>

<p>There is not a single illustration to the fairy tale pre-Disney that shows her wearing anything at all over her chest – in the case of Heath Robinson, <a href="http://sforsnail.blogspot.co.uk/2012/02/little-mermaid.html" target="_blank">this emphasises the ‘Little’ part</a>, as the mermaid is clearly a child in his illustrations.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ariel.jpeg"><img data-attachment-id="13567" data-permalink="/2013/04/29/undressing-the-little-mermaid-disney-adapts-andersen/ariel/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ariel.jpeg?fit=299%2C168&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="299,168" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="ariel" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ariel.jpeg?fit=299%2C168&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ariel.jpeg?fit=299%2C168&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright  wp-image-13567" alt="Disney's Ariel" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ariel.jpeg?resize=269%2C151" width="269" height="151" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>The mermaid is fifteen in Andersen’s tale, so her littleness could be argued either way, but in 1989 Disney producers obviously decided they wanted her to be legal (in most states anyway). To make it completely clear, in the course of the film Ariel declares to her father (a familiar refrain) &#8216;I&#8217;m sixteen years old. I&#8217;m not a child.&#8217;</p>
<p>But however innocently naked (and animated) the Little Mermaid might be, Disney certainly could not show a sixteen year old’s breasts on screen. Their solution to this problem was the creation of a purple bra made out of shells &#8211; a new mermaid first.</p>
<p>When coupled with the waistband-like arrangement at the top of her tail (another innovation, since traditionally the mermaid’s scales segue gradually from the skin at her waist), this decision had the effect of creating a kind of mermaid bikini that implies she might just be wearing an elaborate two-piece – one very similar, in fact, to the <a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Jasmine.jpg" target="_blank">ensemble worn by Princess Jasmine</a> in Disney’s next film, <strong>Aladdin</strong>. And, of course, it also has the effect of emphasising breasts and hips either side of a tiny waist.</p>
<p>The Barbie-style Ariel doll I had as a child had (as modern-day packaging still asserts) &#8216;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Disney-Princess-Ariel-Doll---/dp/B003V02BOO/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1365004666&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=ariel+doll" target="_blank">removable clothes for costume change</a>&#8216;, so it was clear she was a two-legged being with an optional tail.</p>
<p>This has the effect of making the transition from mermaid to human much easier: in Andersen’s story, creating two legs out of one fish tail is exactly as vicious as you would expect it to be, and the draught the mermaid drinks to effect this causes the sensation of ‘a two-edged sword [passing] through her delicate body’ – so severe she passes out. Throughout her subsequent time on land, each foot she puts to the ground feels like ‘treading upon the points of needles or sharp knives’.</p>
<p>Bodily mutilation – indeed, mortification – is everywhere in Andersen&#8217;s story. After everyone is asleep, the mermaid goes to ‘sit on the broad marble steps [of the palace] for it eased her burning feet to bathe them in the cold sea-water’. Significantly &#8211; and somewhat bizarrely &#8211; such mutilation has been an ongoing problem for the Copenhagen representation of Andersen&#8217;s mermaid: the statue in the harbour has been blown up, decapitated (twice) and had its arm sawn off, in addition to many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Mermaid_(statue)#Vandalism" target="_blank">petty acts of vandalism</a> since its erection in 1913.</p>
<h2>Some liberation?</h2>
<p>By contrast with Andersen&#8217;s difficult transition, Ariel’s easy-on, easy-off fish tail and bikini bra combo not only ‘re-opens’ the traditional closed mermaid vessel, it also sexualises the teenage mermaid in a manner markedly different from anything in Andersen’s original (where the mermaid’s love is increased by knowledge of the prince’s good deeds, and her longing for a soul).</p>

<p>By censoring Ariel, Disney draws attention to her body and breasts, so she resembles a California surfer girl. The nakedness, which in earlier illustrations was straightforward and childlike, takes on an explicitly sexual edge (for more on this, have a look at this piece <a href="http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/rrMermaids.html" target="_blank">by Virginia Borges</a>).</p>
<p>The result is that Disney’s <strong>Little Mermaid</strong> becomes the straightforward tale of a sixteen-year-old struggling with her father for the right to explore her burgeoning sexuality and go out with a boy. And because she ultimately uses this right to make a good marriage (wearing <a href="http://disney-clipart.com/wedding/princesses/Wedding-Ariel-Eric-Bride-Groom.jpg" target="_blank">something strikingly similar</a> to <a href="http://www.blogcdn.com/royalwedding.aol.com/media/2011/03/princess-diana-wedding-dresses294.jpg" target="_blank">the dress worn by the equally speechless Princess Diana</a> at her 1981 marriage), Ariel makes good in the end and everyone is happy.</p>
<p>Like most of the Disney Renaissance heroines, hers is the story of a successful transition from the rule of the father to the rule of the husband.</p>
<h2>Other mermaids</h2>
<p>But it’s interesting that at the same time the producers were working on a heteronormative middle-class fantasy idea, their musical wunderkind Howard Ashman (despite dying of what, at the time, was popularly cast as a very non-family-friendly disease) was injecting some Broadway pizzazz into the soundtrack. This included the introduction of a deviantly-styled figure like Divine via the character of Ursula, the Sea Witch (though of course she is defeated, as does not happen in Andersen).</p>
<p>In fact, as the Disney Renaissance got going, the calibre of stars from distinctly non-Disney backgrounds increased: <strong>The Lion King</strong>, the Renaissance nadir, had major Broadway stars alongside A-list Hollywood stars, and the cast included black and Latino actors – something that had not even been considered back in the Forties (when Uncle Walt wanted some racial-caricature ‘Jim Crow’ figures in <strong>Dumbo</strong>, the crows were voiced by white men doing their best ‘black man’ impression instead). The staff list at the Disney studios was full of Jewish and homosexual figures like Ashman. Yet <strong>The Little Mermaid</strong> ushered in some of the most socially conservative films Disney produced. A strange duality.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I want to know why pretty much all of Disney's villains display some kind of sexual or gender deviance.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>In 1937 Goebbels presented a birthday gift of 18 Mickey Mouse shorts to the Führer. [&#8230;Disney] and Hitler [&#8230;] shared an overall social vision. They dreamed of a dispersed post-urban society, with a population — kept in line by a strong domestic realm instilling a keen sense of blood loyalty and &#8220;family values&#8221; — that could be efficiently mobilized to serve either the military needs of the state or the labor needs of industry.</p>
<p>&#8211; Matt Roth, <strong><a href="http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC40folder/LionKing.html">The Lion King: a Short History of Disney-Fascism</a></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Everyone knows about Disney&#8217;s ongoing <a href="http://www.cracked.com/article_15677_the-9-most-racist-disney-characters.html">racism issues</a>, so to hear that Uncle Walt was an active member of the American Nazi Party during the Thirties may not come as much surprise. But there were pink triangles as well as yellow stars in 1930s Berlin, and I want to know why pretty much all of Disney&#8217;s villains seem designed to display some kind of sexual or gender deviance.</p>
<h3>An Actor&#8217;s Life for Me</h3>

<p>It starts with Pinocchio, and the Fox and the Cat. Probably best remembered for their song &#8216;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEQjgGMKqt8">An Actor&#8217;s Life for Me</a>&#8216;, it&#8217;s this pair of crooks that first lure young Pinocchio off the straight and narrow. And I mean that literally: they&#8217;re Theatre Folk, dapper, urbane and not a little camp. Their bodies are constantly intertwining, grotesque and chaotic. I&#8217;m with Matt Roth when he says they&#8217;re obviously coded as gay &#8211; one of the key minorities Hitler argued, in <strong>Mein Kampf</strong>, were threatening the health and morality of contemporary  European youth.</p>
<p>But this doesn&#8217;t end with the fall of Hitler; later Disney films work their way through a succession of sexually deviant or ambiguous villains. The first significant entrant is the terrifying <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maleficent" title="Wikipedia: Maleficent">Maleficent</a> in <strong>Sleeping Beauty</strong>(1959). Like <strong>Aladdin</strong>&#8216;s Jafar (1992), she is elegant and a bit camp, though fundamentally sexless (witness how unattracted Jafar is to Princess Jasmine, wanting her only for political gains). Maleficent inhabits a strange underworld where orgiastic parties are the norm, and, like so many of her villainous successors, she&#8217;s got no-one of her own, but still remains determined to thwart the monogamous, heterosexual union of the noble royals Princess Aurora and Prince Philip (whose name was chosen by Uncle Walt in the 50s, when our Prince Philip was still someone nostalgia-loving Anglophile Americans might feel dewy-eyed about).</p>

<p>Two years later, <strong>101 Dalmatians</strong>&#8216; Cruella De Vil continues the trend. She shares Maleficent&#8217;s ill will towards the heteronormative family sphere, and acts as a kind of child-snatching boogyman. Her hyper-femme fashion sense only throws her withered, sexless frame into relief, and unlike the blissful feminine home of her friend Anita &#8211; who has settled down and found a nice man to take care of, sorting out Roger&#8217;s chaotic life with a Woman&#8217;s Touch &#8211;  Cruella&#8217;s decadent mansion is completely falling apart, which we can probably assume also mirrors the state of her biological clock. Cruella&#8217;s flamboyant yet barren sexuality focuses itself instead on fetishising the traditional trappings of femininity, including fur coats made from the produce of wombs more fecund than her own &#8211; like Perdita, the sexy Dalmatian.</p>
<h3>Dragged Up</h3>
<p>In the 80s, long after Walt&#8217;s death, the intentional gender deviance of Disney&#8217;s villains becomes more blatant still: this time the Gays are even more obviously in drag, and they&#8217;re looking back to the golden <strong>Pinocchio</strong> age of seducing The Children away from their suburban homes: think of Ursula in <strong>The Little Mermaid </strong>(1989) and her contrast with the alpha male King Triton, his big beard, and the Barbie-style InnoDBl with her<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SEyW8eXESQk/TpPRCtPiisI/AAAAAAAAATo/brAhE0e1a9w/s1600/littlemermaid2.jpg"> Princess Diana hair</a>.</p>

<p>Ursula is overweight, flamboyant and dragged up; her tentacles, as my pal Matt Roth points out (you really must read <a href="http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC40folder/LionKing.html">this article</a>, seriously), only make her the more sexually ambiguous. Like Maleficent, she lives in an underground other-world, with a &#8216;garden&#8217; of corrupted young people now condemned to live half-lives as plant-like beings. Her stagey hyper-femininity presents her as a dangerous prospect for the heteronormative, cisnormative InnoDBl &#8211; whose <em>voice</em> she steals in order to seduce the also very straight Prince Eric.</p>
<p>Ursula is given a metaphorical kind of new life (after being conquered by, er, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDGrSgTKEuw&amp;t=3m8s">the erect prow of Prince Eric&#8217;s enormous ship</a>) in the figure of Hades in <strong>Hercules </strong>(1997). He&#8217;s pretty much an exact counterpart to Ursula, black tentacles and all. His cabaret-style song &#8216;My Town&#8217;, from the <strong>Hercules</strong> TV series, introduces the underworld as a kind of underground New York, with its king a flamboyant, gender-ambiguous leader revelling in its delights:</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting, of course, that because of the source-text, <strong>Hercules</strong> must of necessity espouse the Ancient Greek worldview that says the Underworld &#8211; and therefore Hades himself &#8211; is a crucial part of the order of things; unlike the shady worlds of Pleasure Island and The Theatre in Nazi-era <strong>Pinocchio</strong>, &#8216;New Hades&#8217;, and the queers and deviants that inhabit it is a potentially corrupting influence that can be tolerated, as long as it&#8217;s kept firmly in its place. It&#8217;s much the same theory as the &#8216;Circle of Life&#8217; proposed by Mufasa in <strong>The Lion King </strong>(1994) &#8211; the ghettoised handout-dependent hyenas and their liberal, childless and urbane overlord Scar are fine, as long as they&#8217;re kept in their own sphere (that is, the obscure Elephants&#8217; Graveyard). When they take over, the Pridelands fall into ruin and corruption.</p>

<h3>Hanging on</h3>
<div id="attachment_10879" style="width: 309px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/LeFou1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10879" data-attachment-id="10879" data-permalink="/2012/07/04/my-town-the-strange-sexuality-of-disneys-underworld/lefou-2/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/LeFou1.jpg?fit=299%2C164&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="299,164" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="LeFou" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/LeFou1.jpg?fit=299%2C164&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/LeFou1.jpg?fit=299%2C164&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-10879" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/LeFou1.jpg?resize=299%2C164" alt="Le Fou fawns on Gaston and constantly occupies his personal space" width="299" height="164" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-10879" class="wp-caption-text">Intertwined: the hyper-masculine Gaston and the fawning creature Le Fou</p></div>
<p>There are also a whole host of less significant characters throughout Disney&#8217;s oeuvre who are mostly made ridiculous by virtue of their sexual ambiguity and concomitant lack of personhood. First up is the rotund Le Fou in <strong>Beauty and the Beast</strong>, who fawns, much like the Cat on the Fox, on the hyper-male Gaston (who is in strange contrast to the uber-femme but dragged up Ursula, and seems suspiciously uninterested in the various females laid on for his consumption).</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s Chi Fu, the emperor&#8217;s advisor in <strong>Mulan</strong>. He is primarily ridiculed because he is camp and rather gender-ambiguous &#8211; he has bunny slippers and a woman&#8217;s scream &#8211; in what I&#8217;d suggest is a double-whammy of homophobia mixed with Orientalist racism, much like that currently directed against Asian-American basketball player Jeremy Lin (<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/feb/21/jeremy-lin-racism-asian-americans">&#8216;Some lucky lady in NYC is gonna feel a couple of inches of pain tonight</a>&#8216; was a tweet from Fox sports commentator Jason Witlock on Lin&#8217;s recent sporting triumph). Or, to put it in Disney&#8217;s own terms, how about the notorious Siamese Cats in <strong>Lady and the Tramp</strong>, whose own gender is confused to say the least?</p>

<p>It&#8217;s interesting to compare these gender-fails with Chi Fu&#8217;s own filmic context &#8211; <strong>Mulan </strong>(1998), where the title character is herself cross-dressing. There are two direct references to drag in this film (strange, given that Disney doesn&#8217;t in general have much of Dreamworks&#8217; obsessive-compulsive need to shove in over-the-kids&#8217;-heads jokes for the parents). The only one in direct reference to Mulan is Mushu (Eddie Murphy)&#8217;s Hilarious Ebonics &#8211; &#8216;Miss Man had to take her little drag act on the road&#8217;.</p>
<p>Yet, unlike the true weirdos doing it for a sexual thrill (like Ursula), Mulan&#8217;s is a noble gender-variance, taken on for the sole purpose of rescuing her ailing father and (ultimately) preparing herself mentally for marriage, which is how the film ends; note too that she has to become male in order to truly triumph in the male sphere, and that once this has been accomplished she can return home to her father and marry the sexy shirtless man (as she was unable to do at the beginning of the story).</p>
<p>It is therefore in keeping that her methodology basically amounts to &#8216;hair down = female; hair up = male&#8217; &#8211; and no-one ever notices it&#8217;s all the same person, just with a different hairstyle (note <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3f2is11VL0&amp;t=1m19s">how shocked the Evil Shan Yu is when she dons her &#8216;disguise</a>&#8216;): her gender-switch is more of a &#8216;sign&#8217; to the audience indicating which social sphere she&#8217;s inhabiting than anything literally transformative. Interesting stuff here.</p>
<p>Hmm. So&#8230; From the Fox and the Cat to the villains of the 90s, Disney&#8217;s villains have represented a kind of &#8216;other&#8217; that is almost always couched in terms of gender or sexuality, representing a challenge, and a threat, to the heteronormative worldview of the heroes and heroines &#8211; which always conquers, of course. What&#8217;s disturbing is that it&#8217;s so oft-repeated it almost becomes the whole unspoken tenet on which Disney&#8217;s works are based. The fight of good vs. evil is not so much a battle of objective morality as of sexual identity and preference.</p>

<h3><strong>Sonic Nurse</strong></h3>
<p>After the army of Important Academic Languages, and their Distinguished And Layered Relationship With Modern English, we reach this. <em>N</em><em>anny </em>has no real relation to Latin, Greek, French, Middle or even Old English, but derives from &#8216;a child&#8217;s corruption of the word <em>nurse</em>&#8216;, tellingly akin to <em>mamma</em>. <em>Nurse</em>, it must be granted,<em> </em>has slightly more pedigree: it derives from the twelfth-century Old French term <em>norrice</em>,<em> </em>via the Latin <em>nutricius </em>(=<em> </em>&#8216;that suckles, nourishes&#8217;). It<em> </em>first appears in 1530 as a verb &#8216;to suckle&#8217;, and as a noun fifty years later, where it has the meaning we probably use most often: &#8216;one who takes care of the sick&#8217;.</p>

Image from http://www.gonemovies.com/</p></div>
<p><em>Nanny</em> is first cited as an independent word meaning &#8216;a child&#8217;s nurse-maid&#8217; in 1795, whence it proves itself as fluid as you would expect, also encompassing a quasi-proper name, <em>Nana</em> (Cf. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUhwA-C-ACg">Katy Nana</a> in <strong>Mary Poppins</strong>, and the Newfoundland dog in <strong>Peter Pan</strong>). In 1830s America, we meet another deviant form of the same idea: <em>mammy,</em> a dialect corruption of <em>mamma</em> referring to &#8216;a black woman who looks after white children&#8217;. In extended form, <em>mammy </em>refers to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammy_archetype">racial stereotype</a>: &#8216;the loud, overweight and good natured black woman&#8217;, epitomised (in proper name form) in <strong>Gone With The Wind</strong>, and controversially brought to life in an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92kLpKuRJfo">Oscar-winning performance</a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hattie_McDaniel">Hattie McDaniel</a> (above, right). And it&#8217;s not all the Americans: this phenomenon has certain similarities to the British use of native women as nursemaids in colonial India, <em>ayah</em>s, so named in reference to the Hindi word meaning &#8216;nurse&#8217;.</p>
<h3>Dude Ranch Nurse</h3>
<p>All this leads back to one place: the whistleblowing potential of an <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/11/29/an-alphabet-of-femininism-9-i-is-for-infant/">infant&#8217;s cries</a>, in this instance naming the truly maternal figure in their formative years. But then, of course, until the late eighteenth century (the nineteenth, in France), no fashionable woman would even consider nursing her own child: on the contrary, <em>wet nursing </em>(sending your kid out to be suckled by a hired breast) was so common as to be automatic. Newborns were generally sent away for up to two years to be <em>nourished</em>, at a rate of anything from a few shillings a week to between £25 &#8211; 50 a year.</p>
<p>The reasons were as varied as the price, spanning the apparently trivial (social custom, and the desire to return to public life ASAP); the medical (fears for the mother&#8217;s health after the strain of lying in <em>sans </em>twenty-first century advantages), and the &#8216;medical&#8217; (the widespread notion that sex with a nursing woman would damage her milk and therefore the child, and the belief that conception was impossible during this time anyway). It also seems possible that rampant infant mortality may have contributed: parents would send their children away until they had survived their most dangerous years, rather than invest emotional energy in a little&#8217;un who might well leave you before their first birthday.</p>
<p>That said, the enduring influence of the nanny <em>qua</em> mother-figure lasted long into the twentieth century, albeit mostly among the mega-aristocracy: <strong>The King&#8217;s Speech </strong>(2011) imagines the future George VI to have been closer to his nannies than his family; one of these, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Bill">Charlotte Bill</a>, was famously also an effective mother to his autistic and epileptic younger brother, Johnny (re-created in the 2003 BBC serial <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lost_Prince">The Lost Prince</a></strong>).</p>

<p>The women who actually did all this nursing were inevitably of a lower social class than their clients – if not a different race – although they could earn good money (and possibly a nice pension) in the process. Here we tumble into a parallel nanny universe: the word in its more formal sense originating from another <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/10/25/an-alphabet-of-femininism-4-d-is-for-doll/">proper name</a><em>. </em>Through a bit of shuffling, good old <em>Ann</em> became first <em>Nan</em> and then <em>Nanny</em>, in which incarnation, around 1788, the word came to simply connote femininity, as in <em>Nanny-goat </em>(= &#8216;a female goat&#8217;, on which see also &#8216;Jenny Wren&#8217; and &#8216;jenny-ass&#8217;). Like <em>Doll</em>, Nan&#8217;s trajectory suggests commonness, generic feminine identity, and while the dictionary is specific on the two <em>nannies</em>&#8216; separation, its stated origin in an infant&#8217;s mouth is by definition uncertain, language development fluid, and the connections between milking and the farmyard in need of little exposition – compare the nineteenth-century term <em>baby farmer</em>, a lower-class wet nurse happy to let her charges die because her one-off fee encouraged little else. The term was always pejorative, and synonymous with the dangerous, non-nurturing female.</p>
<p>In contrast, we have the <em>nannies </em>who stayed with one family for generations (like the <em>mammy</em> and the <em>ayah </em>abroad): these last are inevitably conventionally &#8216;older&#8217; than their baby-farming colleagues, and presumably played a more extended mothering role. It is these strange insider-outsiders who appear in literature as bawdy and decrepit old women, inevitably depicted as their job title suggests: firmly on the side of the children they raise, to the extent that they will happily aid their improper sexual dalliances. It is thus that the <em>Nurse</em> appears in <strong>Romeo and Juliet</strong>, and in Keats&#8217; <strong>The Eve of St. Agnes</strong>. The suspicion inevitably directed at these figures is certainly class-based: wet nursing&#8217;s detractors had been arguing for years that by withholding mothers&#8217; milk parents risked their children absorbing working-class mannerisms – and criminal tendencies – from their surrogate teats.</p>
<h3>Na na na na na.</h3>
<p>The next stop for the <em>nanny </em>is in the inter-war years, with representatives including P.L. Travers&#8217; <strong>Mary Poppins</strong>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Now_We_Are_Six">poems </a>of A. A. Milne, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noel_Streatfeild">Noel Streatfeild</a>&#8216;s legion of sexless &#8216;cottage loaf&#8217; Nanas. Streatfeild&#8217;s children are almost invariably orphaned, and their Nana-figure keeps them nourished through &#8216;nursery ways&#8217;, a stubborn lack of sentimentality, and a feeling of permanence sadly lacking in the increasingly fragmented world of war-torn Britain. A similar idea is repeated in the 1964 Disney film of Travers&#8217; novel, which makes the significant decision to backdate events to 1910, when the focus is on &#8216;moulding the breed&#8217; for future colonial greatness:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIamxYhVfnI">A British nanny must be a general! </a><br />
The future empire lies within her hands.<br />
And so the person that we need<br />
To mould the breed<br />
Is a nanny who can give commands!</p>
<p>Walt Disney&#8217;s <strong>Mary Poppins </strong>(1964)</p></blockquote>
<p>In so doing, Disney&#8217;s film situates the<em> nanny </em>as part of &#8216;tradition, discipline and rules&#8217;, nurturing Britain&#8217;s future rather than its children, and flying in the face of its very etymology.</p>
<p>Mr Banks&#8217; song does, however, lead us to the final stop on <em>nanny&#8217;</em>s childishly simple word-journey: its modern incarnation as the Dreaded <em>Nanny State </em>(first appearing some time between the fifties and sixties). Always an opprobrious term (<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4044815.stm">attempts to re-appropriate it</a> have met with derision)  critics of government intervention ranging from the welfare state to the smoking ban hark back to the <em>nanny </em>to point up &#8216;mollycoddling&#8217;, the infantalisation of the people (who are presumably thus reduced to the baby-talk of the nursery) returning to <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=F3vwrJQWukUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false">childhood with a fussy female at the helm</a>. Wash your face, dearie.</p>
