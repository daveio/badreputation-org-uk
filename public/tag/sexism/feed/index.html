					<description><![CDATA[Who else is into tabletop roleplaying and sick of all the whitewashing and chainmail bikinis?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li><em><strong>Rabalias</strong> of RPG-gaming blogging collective <a href="http://blackarmada.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Black Armada</strong></a> sent us this post, together with a petition. And if <strong>you</strong> have a guest post brewing in your brain, you know the drill: <a href="mailto:badrepeditors@gmail.com?subject=pitch">email us on badrepeditors@gmail.com</a>.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dungeons and Dragons (D&amp;D)</strong> is the single most famous roleplaying game in the world, the route most people got into roleplaying, and the flagship of the hobby. So it&#8217;s a tragedy that the game is pushing away potential fans through artwork and even game text that is overwhelmingly focused on one customer demographic: white men.</p>
<div id="attachment_12997" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/?attachment_id=12997" rel="attachment wp-att-12997"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12997" data-attachment-id="12997" data-permalink="/2013/01/08/guest-post-dd-and-who-its-packaged-for/dice/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/dice.jpg?fit=500%2C333&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="500,333" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="dice" data-image-description="&lt;p&gt;Not everybody who enjoys the use of these is a straight cis white dude.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>That’s a pretty provocative statement, right there. But I’m confident in making it, because the evidence is there for anyone who wants to see it. You could start by flipping open a copy of pretty much any D&amp;D book and looking through the artwork. See how many women and people of colour you can find – and then see how many of them are half-dressed or made to look weak or submissive.</p>
<p>Actually, you don’t need to, because someone already did it for you. Anna Kreider <a href="http://www.pelgranepress.com/?p=3501" target="_blank">reviewed the artwork in the D&amp;D 4th edition</a> books (specifically the <strong>Dungeon Master’s Guide</strong>, <strong>Players Handbook</strong>, <strong>Players Handbook 2</strong> and the <strong>Adventurer’s Vault</strong>) and rated the images therein.</p>
<p>Kreider’s findings were striking – of the 40% or so of humans (and demi-humans) that were depicted as female, well over a third hit each of the measures she chose (being half-dressed or posed in a sexually suggestive way, for instance). Needless to say, the remaining 60% of images, the ones which were of men, tended to be wearing more clothes, in more active, non-sexual poses.</p>
<p>It gets better, because Chris Van Dyke <a href="http://raceindnd.wordpress.com/2008/11/18/nerd-nite-presentation-november-18th-2008/" target="_blank">had a look at D&amp;D from the perspective of race</a>. He was able to find only two examples of a non-white character in the core books of all four numbered editions of D&amp;D. That means non-white folks are practically invisible in D&amp;D.</p>
<p>Now, these findings are based on subjective judgements. That’s unavoidable, because things like “sexually suggestive” and “white” can often only be judged subjectively in artwork. You can go and judge for yourself if you doubt their conclusions. But I think if we’re honest, these results only confirm what most of us already knew from experience.</p>
<p>It isn’t the end of the world. I’ve enjoyed lots of pop culture replete with sexism. And after all, it’s only a fantasy! But then again, shouldn’t our fantasy worlds contain a richer variety of creatures than real life? And what does it say to potential new gamers if they can’t find a picture of someone like them anywhere in these books? Is D&amp;D really just a game about white dudes slugging it out in a dungeon somewhere? I don’t think so.</p>
<p>OK, so what to do about it? I love roleplaying, and despite years of moaning about the mechanics, I still love D&amp;D. The fact that it’s not exactly a beacon of gender and racial equality is, for me, an obstacle to be overcome rather than a sign I should give up on the game altogether.</p>
<p>It so happens that <a href="http://www.wizards.com" target="_blank">Wizards of the Coast</a> are writing a new edition of D&amp;D right now. That’s why I put together <a href="http://www.thepetitionsite.com/522/618/587/dd-should-be-for-everyone-not-just-white-men/" target="_blank">a petition calling on them to do better</a>.</p>
<p>If you’ve read this far, maybe you agree with me – and if so, it would be great if you went and <a href="http://www.thepetitionsite.com/522/618/587/dd-should-be-for-everyone-not-just-white-men/" target="_blank">signed it</a>, and better yet share it with your friends and encourage them to sign too.</p>
<p>The petition won’t change anything in itself. Wizards of the Coast could ignore it, and maybe they will. But if they can see that there are hundreds of gamers out there who want more than whitewash and chainmail bikinis, maybe they’ll respond. We owe it to the hobby to give them a clear message.</p>

<blockquote><p>“It’s all about the joy of creation&#8230;”</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230; is the song that Lego use on their website to showcase their <a href="http://friends.lego.com/en-gb/Default.aspx" target="_blank">Friends series</a>.</p>
<p>Not what you were expecting? Perhaps you thought <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=GB&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;v=DwBirf4BWew" target="_blank"><strong>Stand By Your Man</strong></a> or some other such cringeworthy song might be more appropriate for a series so blatantly gendered. Well, so did I, but one happy little girl at a time, the Friends range has swayed my feelings.</p>
<p>Let me backtrack and give it some history.</p>
<p>The Lego Friends series was released earlier this year.</p>
<p>When the toys (and adverts) were unleashed, the internet seemingly exploded with outrage. (I am,<br />
of course, referring to <em>my</em> internet &#8211; the one with feminist twitter feeds, blogs about toys and sexy pictures of Neil Gaiman. Your internet might be a bit different.)</p>
<p>In particular I watched <a href="http://www.feministfrequency.com/" target="_blank">Feminist Frequency</a>’s <a href="http://www.feministfrequency.com/2012/01/lego-gender-part-1-lego-friends/" target="_blank">videos on</a> <a href="http://www.feministfrequency.com/2012/02/lego-gender-part-2-the-boys-club/" target="_blank">the series</a>, but I also read blogposts from dads who want their girls to work in Silicon Valley and study at MIT.</p>
<p>The first few toys released were a bakery, a café, a beauty shop, a house and an inventor’s<br />
workshop. These initial toys are made up of pastel pink and purple bricks, they only feature girls and<br />
those roles present are mainly gendered home-keeping roles.</p>
<p>My blood was boiling, like many other people&#8217;s, at the narrow roles I could see girls being pushed into. At my local Toys R Us there is a vast collection of Lego from the <a href="http://creator.lego.com/en-gb/Default.aspx" target="_blank">Creator series</a> to <a href="http://www.lego.com/cars/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank">Cars</a>. In fact I have never seen so much in one retailer.</p>
<p>However, the Friends series is not placed in their giant Lego selection. It is in a (very clearly labelled) ‘Girlz’ aisle,nowhere near the Lego corner, which has so much sparkle and glitter I thought cupcakes were<br />
going to spontaneously erupt from the walls.</p>
<p>Friends is not like the rest of Lego: it’s for girls, and must be segregated.</p>
<p>So far, so sexist.</p>
<p>However, I’m slowly putting the guns down. Across the various worlds of Lego, equality is growing. As someone who has an obsessive love of toys, I frequently visit their website. Every time I find<br />
myself riled up about Lego, I go on the site and find that a far greater balance of characters is presented there than we see in the shops.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/NyaSamura3.png"><img data-attachment-id="12907" data-permalink="/2012/12/11/guest-post-lego-friends-revisited/nyasamura3/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/NyaSamura3.png?fit=216%2C407&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="216,407" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="NyaSamura3" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/NyaSamura3.png?fit=159%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/NyaSamura3.png?fit=216%2C407&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-12907" title="NyaSamura3" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/NyaSamura3-159x300.png?resize=159%2C300" alt="Nya from Spinjitsu range" width="159" height="300" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/NyaSamura3.png?w=159&amp;ssl=1 159w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/NyaSamura3.png?w=216&amp;ssl=1 216w" sizes="(max-width: 159px) 100vw, 159px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>For example, they have little character bios for nearly every mini-figure. I was angry about the lack of girl characters in <a href="http://ninjago.lego.com/en-gb/Default.aspx" target="_blank">Spinjitzu</a>. But Nya (pictured right) has a  <a href="http://ninjago.lego.com/en-gb/world/characters/default.aspx" target="_blank">token girl description</a> which does include phrases like &#8220;she’s no damsel in distress&#8221; and &#8220;Nya is fed up with the ninjas’ boy’s club syndrome&#8221;.</p>
<p>Here, the minority female mini figures I have collected become role models. Still a token, but a valuable one at that, and the question remains why we don’t see more of this outside of the website.</p>
<p>I recently decided to explore the <a href="http://friends.lego.com/en-us/Products/Details/3934.aspx" target="_blank">Friends section of the website</a> and was pleasantly surprised and then genuinely excited about what it offers. I believe that Lego listened to t<a href="http://www.change.org/petitions/tell-lego-to-stop-selling-out-girls-liberatelego" target="_blank">he petition from Change.org</a> (the one that got over 50,000 signatures, the one I signed) back in April 2012, and have turned something that was completely sexist into a city of steps toward empowerment.</p>
<p>First of all, they have toned down the overwhelming pink tones of the bricks, and gone for more brown tones, like <a href="http://friends.lego.com/en-us/Products/Details/3185.aspx" target="_blank">the riding camp</a>. There is also a greater range of sets, including a <a href="http://friends.lego.com/en-us/Products/Details/3065.aspx" target="_blank">treehouse</a>, design<br />
studio, bedroom set with a drum kit and the <a href="http://friends.lego.com/en-us/Products/Details/3063.aspx" target="_blank">Heartlake Flying Club</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/flying.png"><img data-attachment-id="12905" data-permalink="/2012/12/11/guest-post-lego-friends-revisited/flying/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/flying.png?fit=575%2C335&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="575,335" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="flying" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/flying.png?fit=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/flying.png?fit=575%2C335&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-12905 aligncenter" title="flying" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/flying.png?resize=575%2C335" alt="Lego Friends flying school image of aeroplane" width="575" height="335" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/flying.png?w=575&amp;ssl=1 575w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/flying.png?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 575px) 100vw, 575px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>This last set was definitely the swing vote for me. It has the least amount of pink; mere touches of it on the plane. Furthermore, the stereotyped role for women in a plane is Air Hostess, and Lego didn’t go there. Stephanie is the pilot of her own seaplane, looking more Amelia Earhart than Pan Am.</p>
<p>The Friends themselves might enjoy traditionally feminine roles, but they also have jobs, varied interests and detailed characters that allow for diverse roleplaying. The key with Lego is that it can be as many things as you can imagine. <a href="http://friends.lego.com/en-us/Products/Details/3936.aspx" target="_blank">Emma’s Design Studio</a>, for instance, has one piece which suggests this is for fashion &#8211; but with the large desk, the ruler and the laptop Emma could just as easily be an architect or an engineer.</p>
<p>We also shouldn&#8217;t fall into the trap of thinking that enjoying balloons or sweets makes you weak. It&#8217;s more that giving girls <em>only</em> that which is sugary-sweet which is the issue. Although Lego still have a long way to go, I think there are at least positive conversations being had at Lego HQ.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.feministfrequency.com/2012/02/lego-gender-part-2-the-boys-club/" target="_blank">her second Lego video</a> Anita Sarkeseesian says that the emphasis with the Lego Friends series is on traditional home-keeping play. She cites the adverts, comparing the Friends advert slogan “Drive to the newly built café” to the “You can build the castle” of another Lego advert featuring some classic father-son bonding.</p>
<p>She draws the reasonable conclusion that boys are offered a more active play experience that encourages them to use maths and motor skills.</p>
<p>However, if we look on the Lego website the section for Friends has the theme song I quoted at the beginning of this post, which accompanies all their videos:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We can do it, we can dream a whole new way<br />
We can do it, you can build with me today<br />
It’s all about the joy of creation”</p></blockquote>
<p>I think this new emphasis on <em>building</em> which is subtly surrounding you the whole time you shop is part of a change that encourages girls to gain all the skills and experiences that Lego has to offer.</p>
<p>They may not have it all, but the newer Lego Friends sets and marketing are a step in the right direction, and with these steps being echoed in other areas of the Lego Universe… watch this space.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I am a gamer.  First and foremost.  My biological sex and gender identity do not factor into this.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am a gamer.  First and foremost.  My physical sex and gender identity do not factor into this.  The only other identity-factors that come into play when I talk about gaming are age, time and style preferences: e.g.<em> &#8220;I&#8217;m a twenty-something gamer, I&#8217;ve been gaming for over 17 years and I play FPS games a lot, with single-player RPGs in second.&#8221;</em>  Simples, as the cool &#8216;kats say.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also a bit of an amateur linguist; I look at the language people use and what it means to use it in different circumstances for no other reason than it interests me.  I&#8217;ve been considering a discussion on the language of gaming with BadRep for some time now, and I think this would be a good first topic: the problem with &#8216;girl gamer&#8217; as an identifier.</p>
<p>Obviously, everyone is welcome to self-describe however they see fit, but I&#8217;d just like it if people could think about this term a little bit before applying it to themselves or others.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/gamegirl.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="12237" data-permalink="/2012/09/11/gamer-diary-self-segregation-and-girl-gamers/gamegirl/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/gamegirl.jpg?fit=500%2C333&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="500,333" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="gamegirl" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/gamegirl.jpg?fit=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/gamegirl.jpg?fit=500%2C333&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/gamegirl-300x199.jpg?resize=300%2C199" alt="" title="gamegirl" width="300" height="199" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-12237" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/gamegirl.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/gamegirl.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Let&#8217;s think about &#8216;gamer&#8217;.  We all recognise this as meaning &#8216;someone who plays games&#8217; with the extended connotation nowadays that this means computer- &amp; video-games (as opposed to card games or board games).  There&#8217;s no other extended definition: it&#8217;s not exclusive to male players.  A gamer is just a person.</p>
<p>Now: &#8216;girl&#8217;.  I have a serious problem with the general use of this word when referring to <em>adults</em>, anyway.  A <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/11/15/an-alphabet-of-femininism-7-g-is-for-girl/">girl</a> or a boy is a child.  Use of either when speaking of an adult is insulting, infantilising and diminutive. (I won&#8217;t even use the words boyfriend or girlfriend if I can avoid them). The problem with coupling &#8216;girl&#8217; with &#8216;gamer&#8217; is that it accentuates the misconception that the gamer in question isn&#8217;t mature enough or capable enough to play with the adults &#8211; thereby widening the void between male and female gamers and adding to the sexism that some experience.</p>
<p><em>~Insert disclaimer on how we all know that not all gamers are sexist.  Furthermore, it&#8217;s not just male gamers who are sexist in gaming either.~</em></p>
<p>Using &#8216;girl gamer&#8217; on one&#8217;s self and others is just adding fuel to the sexist contingent&#8217;s fire, because it&#8217;s a way of self-segregating, and not a very positive way at that.  We rarely hear of other segregated terms &#8211; you don&#8217;t nearly as often see references to black gamers, white gamers, asian gamers, boy gamers, gay gamers, intergalactic invader gamers &#8211; at least, not in the same way. So why should we encourage the use of &#8216;girl gamer&#8217; if at the same time we&#8217;re trying to fight against being segregated based on sex or gender?</p>
<p>Sure, if we&#8217;re actually talking about <em>children</em>, then by all means use &#8216;girl&#8217;, as long as we&#8217;re willing to use &#8216;boy&#8217; alongside it.  In the adult world, however, self-referral as a &#8216;girl&#8217; plays into the patriarchal control mechanisms of English, which then eke their way into the gamer consciousness.  Unfortunately, as English-speakers, we get to speak a very sexist language, historically used by the powerful to subjugate and cling to power.  In the past, those powerful people have primarily been male, so there&#8217;s no surprise that the language of the realm has been adapted to keep others out of power and quash protest.</p>
<p>You can see this simply in the way people talk without even touching on gamers and gaming.  How many times have you heard someone refer to male and female adults as &#8216;guys&#8217; and &#8216;girls&#8217;?  &#8216;Guy&#8217; is widely accepted as referencing an adult man, whereas &#8216;girl&#8217; is a word for a child, and puts the women in the inferior position.</p>
<p>Language is important and so is the use of language.  Any linguist will tell you that, regardless of their sex or gender.  If you pause to think about it, anybody can realise how important language is.  The words we choose to use are always vital to building the way we want to describe, discuss, identify and progress.  &#8216;Girl gamer&#8217; is problematic.  It&#8217;s used as a derogatory term by some in the community to imply that female gamers are separate and inept, and that they should be kept that way.  Attempts at reclamation of the term are fraught with complications as no matter how positive the intention, it still perpetuates this segregation, infatilisation and dismissal from the realm of The Gamer.</p>
<p>We need to remember that within gaming, it&#8217;s the game that matters.  Games are forms of escapism, so why should anything about us personally be important when we&#8217;re gaming?  Yes, our identities come into play when we discuss development and progression of our preferred art form/entertainment source, but when we&#8217;re playing, they&#8217;re irrelevant.  You don&#8217;t need to be male, female, trans*, gay, straight, bi, queer, old, young, white, black or anything else; when you game, you are a gamer.  Anyone can game, and we have the potential to create and mould a fantastically inclusive community to wrap around our favourite hobby &#8211; we just need to take care with how we define ourselves and the language we use.</p>
<p><strong>We are all gamers.</strong>That&#8217;s it.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Come on Tesco, men can like knitting and women can read Private Eye...]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Lizzie</strong> sent us the following update to <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/07/30/guest-post-magazine-rack-sexism-or-women-read-private-eye-too">her recent previous guest post</a> this morning. If you have a guest post brewing in your brain, you know what to do: pitch us at <a href="mailto:badrepeditors@gmail.com?Subject=Pitch">badrepeditors@gmail.com</a>.</em></p>
<p>About a month ago I emailed both Sainsburys and Tesco, following it up with tweets, about the gendering of magazines. It seemed wrong that <strong>New Scientist</strong>, <strong>Photography</strong>, <strong>NME</strong>, <strong>The Economist</strong> and <strong>Private Eye</strong> sat in &#8216;Men&#8217;s Interests&#8217; sections while women had the 3,738 fashion and beauty mags as well as knitting and cooking mags.</p>
<p>Tesco were the first to respond, telling me via tweet that they were passing this up to central management:</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Capture.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="11855" data-permalink="/2012/08/09/guest-post-further-adventures-with-magazine-rack-sexism/capture/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Capture.jpg?fit=526%2C211&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="526,211" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Barrett, Lizzie&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1343746153&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Capture" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Capture.jpg?fit=300%2C120&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Capture.jpg?fit=526%2C211&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Capture.jpg?resize=526%2C211" alt="" title="Capture" width="526" height="211" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11855" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Capture.jpg?w=526&amp;ssl=1 526w, https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Capture.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 526px) 100vw, 526px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>It took a while for anything else to happen, but a week later <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/07/30/guest-post-magazine-rack-sexism-or-women-read-private-eye-too/">I got an email from Sainsburys</a> saying that where they were refurbishing or creating a new store, they would cease to gender their magazines.</p>
<p>Fabulous. I mean, I would prefer it if they spent the small amount of money printing new labels for the plastic holders on their magazine racks and replaced them all NOW, but that&#8217;s because they have a lot of stores, and seeing this every day still makes my head hurt and fear for young girls who go in and subconsciously learn that science and politics are not for them and that they should concentrate on being pretty while cooking.<sup><a href="/2012/08/09/guest-post-further-adventures-with-magazine-rack-sexism/#footnote_0_11852" id="identifier_0_11852" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" Ed&rsquo;s tiny note: Or indeed the boys who learn to compartmentalise &ldquo;knitting&rdquo;, for example, as &ldquo;for girls&rdquo; &ndash; certainly some proud male knitters have commented on this site in the past! ">1</a></sup></p>
<p>But Tesco still haven&#8217;t replied properly. Nothing more except another tweet to BadRep saying management are looking at it. And now, the <a href="http://www.everydaysexism.com/">Everyday Sexism Project</a> (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/everydaysexism">@EverydaySexism</a> on Twitter, and you can also check out the hashtag #everydaysexism) is really helping out &#8211; drawing attention to the gendered labels in a local store and retweeting those pressuring <a href="http://www.twitter.com/uktesco">@UKTesco</a> to take some form of action.</p>
<p>What would be even better would be for more of us to email them. And while you&#8217;re at it, email Sainsburys too and ask them to put their hand in their pocket to start making the changes now, so we don&#8217;t have to look at this sexism everyday. It&#8217;s just not good enough.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Why are so many magazines still stocked as "men's interest"? ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Our mate Lizzie &#8211; she of the <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/tag/lizzies-feminist-wedding-quest/">wedding adventures</a> &#8211; sent us this post a few weeks ago. She&#8217;s been taking supermarkets to task, because in 2012 we really shouldn&#8217;t be seeing political mags (or<strong> Total Film</strong>, or <strong>Kerrang!</strong>) on a shelf marked <em>MEN&#8217;S INTEREST</em>. She&#8217;s not alone in her view, either &#8211; lately feminists around the UK have been making the point, with a particular upsurge recently (perhaps in the wake of other successful retail-themed mini campaigns, like Londonfeminist&#8217;s <a href="http://londonfeminist.com/site/dear-new-look/">calling out the World Cup sexist t-shirts on sale in New Look</a>, or WH Smith&#8217;s <a href="http://www.thisiskent.co.uk/Women-win-battle-WHSmith-sexism-row/story-13297949-detail/story.html">decision in 2011</a> to stop categorising certain books as &#8220;women&#8217;s fiction&#8221;). About three weeks before we were originally going to post this, <a href="http://vagendamag.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/tesco-retro.html">the Vagenda drew attention to the Magazine Rack Sexism Problem</a>, and across the pond <a href="http://notanaughtyword.blogspot.co.uk/2011/10/weaponry-or-weddings-sexism-in.html">things don&#8217;t seem much different either</a>. </p>
<p>A few days after we received the post, one chain emailed Lizzie back. We&#8217;ve added the email into the post so you can see CUSTOMER SERVICE IN ACTION.</p>

<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>Dear Tesco and Sainsburys,</p>
<p>Can you please cease categorising <strong>The Economist</strong>, <strong>New Scientist</strong>, <strong>Private Eye</strong>, and the <strong>Spectator</strong> as &#8216;Men&#8217;s Interest&#8217; magazines? I think you’ll find all genders are interested in politics and business. You are perpetuating the myth that women only care about (because they are valued for) their beauty.</p>
<p>While I accept (but hate) that a large proportion of women read <strong>Cosmo</strong> and <strong>Marie Claire</strong> and <strong>Good Housekeeping</strong>, I think that a large proportion also watch the news, vote, work, and may be interested in reading <strong>The Economist </strong>from time to time. You don’t segregate papers (although papers themselves, with their Femail sections, and Style sections, also start pushing my buttons). Why the shit have you determined that certain topics are not for the eyes of women?</p>
<p>Women still suffer unequal pay way before they think about maternity leave, and this is part of the same problem &#8211; you are saying that business and politics (something we are all involved in, one way or another) is purely the domain of men.</p>
<p>Sort this out immediately, please. It&#8217;s patronising and misogynistic. Actually, can you please also remove film, photography, game, cars, nature and music mags from the same category while you are at it, as that&#8217;s also inaccurate as well? Unless you think women <em>can&#8217;t</em> like music, cars, photography, video games, nature and film? I mean, it’s not as if you really think only men are interested in those topics, right? You have to admit that, say, there have been some female musicians, and some women actually enjoy going to the cinema and hey, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Arbus">Diane Arbus</a> existed, and gosh, there are female commuters on the roads.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d stick with just <strong>Men&#8217;s Health</strong> if I were you, and even that’s shaky.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Women in the UK</p>
<h3>What to do?</h3>
<p>To complain to Tesco, please <a href="https://www.tescohelp.com/tesco/forms/cs_form.html">go here</a>. For Sainsburys, <a href="http://www.sainsburys.co.uk/sol/contact_us/contact_us.jsp">here</a>. If we get enough people complaining, maybe they’ll actually listen and change their stores. I mean, if a little girl <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-16812545">can get the name of a loaf of bread changed at Sainsbury’s</a>, surely they&#8217;re amenable to listening to vindicated complaints by women who are tired of being told to not use our brains and instead just look pretty. I mean, bread name change by photogenic small child must have meant something rather than being innocuous PR in a time of recession, right?</p>
<h3>Boom! Progress from Sainsburys!</h3>
<blockquote><p><strong>From: Sainsburys<br />
To: Lizzie</strong></p>
<p>Dear Lizzie</p>
<p>Thank you for your email and suggestion that we reconsider the signage used to categorise magazines in our stores.  I understand you feel our current method is dated and we certainly do not want to imply the magazines are gender specific.</p>
<p>Up until now we have used information from publishers, who identify the target demographic for their magazines.  We have organised the magazines on our shelves accordingly.  We appreciate the points you have made, and have undertaken a review of the signage we use in store.</p>
<p>I am pleased to say that going forward, our magazines will be shown by genre and they will not have a gender prefix.  There will not be an immediate change to the magazine sections in all our stores as this will be a gradual roll out replacing the existing signage.  This should also address the grammar issues that you kindly brought to our attention. </p>
<p>We appreciate you taking the time to contact us, giving us the opportunity to look into your concerns.  We look forward to seeing you in store again soon.</p></blockquote>
<p>So that just leaves Tesco, from whom, as we go to press, Lizzie is still waiting to hear. Bad form, guys. (Although what Sainsburys mean by &#8220;grammar issues&#8221; is eluding us slightly here at BR Towers. This is a SEXISM ISSUE.)</p>
<p>Time to get on it, readers! To the Tesco feedback page, one and all. </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Thanks to Lizzie for making a noise and sending us her progress. Have you had a Customer Service Breakthrough or Problem lately? Get in touch and tell us all about it!</em></li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello my darlings!  This month I&#8217;m back to my mid-month gaming post (as last month I wandered into the<a title="Silent Witness s15: ‘Calm down, dear…’" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/05/28/silent-witness-s15-calm-down-dear/" target="_blank"> realms of TV</a>) and I&#8217;ll be presenting to you the Humble Bundle V, after which we&#8217;ll be taking a bit of a negative turn&#8230; you will see.  Potential <em>trigger warning</em>, mind you, of the Epic Rage descent.</p>
<h3>Humble Bundle V</h3>
<p>The <strong><a title="The Humble Bundle" href="http://www.humblebundle.com" target="_blank">Humble Bundle</a></strong> is a nice little concept: a collection of indie titles for you to pay what you want for and then decide how much of that fee goes to a) the developers, b) Humble Bundle themselves, or c) charity.</p>
<p>I got it on the first day (and, sorry, but by the time this post goes live I suspect the window will have closed) so I only got the first five games that were included.  Since then there&#8217;ve been three more titles added if you paid over the average.  These were added in light of this bundle making over <a title="PC Gamer: Humble Indie Bundle makes $1.8m in first 15 hours" href="http://www.pcgamer.com/2012/06/01/humble-indie-bundle-5-makes-1-8-million-in-15-hours/?ns_campaign=article-feed&amp;ns_mchannel=ref&amp;ns_source=steam&amp;ns_linkname=0&amp;ns_fee=0" target="_blank">$1.8 million in the first 15 hours</a>.</p>
<p>Included in the Bundle were:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Psychonauts</strong></li>
<li><strong>Amnesia: The Dark Descent</strong></li>
<li><strong>LIMBO</strong></li>
<li><strong>Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sorcery EP</strong></li>
<li><strong>Bastion</strong>*</li>
<li><strong>Braid</strong>*+</li>
<li><strong>Lone Survivor</strong>*+</li>
<li><strong>Super Meat Boy</strong>*+</li>
</ul>
<p><em>* denotes games that were unlocked if you paid over the average; + denotes those titles added at a later stage.</em></p>
<p>Like I say, I only got the first five, but I&#8217;m not too sore as I already have <strong>Braid</strong> (not a big fan) and I&#8217;m not overly interested in the other two.  I&#8217;m not going to discuss the games themselves here because that&#8217;ll be coming in a &#8220;Playing&#8230;&#8221; post later on.</p>
<p>I thought it would be nice show you that sometimes, somewhere out there, someone does something good.  A lot of money has been raised for charity through this: not least through Big Names of Gaming competing to be the top contributors (<em>Notch</em> and <em>HumbleBrony Bundle</em> have been vying for the top spot: when I bought the bundle they were dueling around the $3000 mark, now they&#8217;re on $12,345.67 and £11,111.11 respectively).</p>

<p>Of course, as the popularity of indie games continues to rise, it&#8217;s nice to be able to have the choice to decide how much of your cash goes to the developers as opposed to not really knowing for sure how much just gets kept by various third parties.</p>
<h3>Sigh, Misogyny</h3>
<p>From that nice little snippet of camaraderie, I regret that I must now depress the tone somewhat and talk about InternetFail, and more specifically, how it&#8217;s been discussed recently with regard to the world of gaming.</p>
<p>At the start of June <strong>BBC News Magazine</strong> ran an article highlighting the constant, abhorrent abuse that female gamers get in online play: <a title="BBC News Magazine: Sexual harrasment in the world of video games" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-18280000" target="_blank">here</a>.  It mostly focusses on the experiences of one Wisconsin gamer called Jenny, of the<strong> CoD</strong> ilk, and the abuse she gets daily on voice chats.  She records them and uploads them to her website, <strong><a title="Not in the Kitchen Anymore" href="http://www.notinthekitchenanymore.com/" target="_blank">Not in the Kitchen Anymore</a></strong>, and I gotta say, she handles this shit pretty well but the point is she<em> shouldn&#8217;t have to</em>.  Especially, as the article points out, 42% of US gamers are women, and adult women outnumber teenage boys quite considerably.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a <a title="BBC World Service: Assignment: Guns, Girls and Games" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00s9jly" target="_blank">BBC World Service programme</a> based on her experiences and those of other female gamers.  If you read the article or listen to the programme you might hear some charming young fellows claiming<em> &#8220;freedom of speech&#8221;</em>, but here&#8217;s a point of interest for any such time someone tries to use this smokescreen of an excuse if you call them out as misogynists (or racists, homophobes, etc&#8230; the list, depressingly, goes on).  In both American and European (incl. British) law the &#8220;freedom of speech&#8221; excuse doesn&#8217;t fly.</p>
<p>Why&#8217;s that?  Well, if you actually read the laws you&#8217;ll see there are exclusions to what the precious First Amendment protects: <a title="Wikipedia: Freedom of Speech in the USA - Categorical Exclusions" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech_in_the_United_States#Categorical_exclusions" target="_blank">look here</a>.  What&#8217;s that?  Obscenity?  Threats?  Defamation?  Intentional infliction of emotional distress?  They&#8217;re <em>all</em> excluded from protection by the First Amendment?  OHGAWDNO!  It&#8217;s like living in a world where people treat each other with respect!  How horrible.</p>
<p>And, Euro law?  <em>Just for starters</em> you can consult <a title="Wikipedia: Article 10 of the ECHR" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_10_of_the_European_Convention_on_Human_Rights" target="_blank">Article 10</a> and <a title="Wikipedia: Article 14 of the ECHR" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights#Article_14_-_discrimination" target="_blank">Article 14</a> of the European Convention of Human Rights.  Yeah.  <strong><em>Human rights</em></strong>.  But be careful out there: trying to educate these fools in the error of their ways <strong>and</strong> the legal flaws in their defence might offend them.  The fact you&#8217;ve done some learnings <em>(that aren&#8217;t centred around how to make tasty lunchtime treats)</em> is clearly a work of pure evil!</p>
<p>Although Jenny of Wisconsin might be able to deal with it, there are a lot of people out there who can&#8217;t or don&#8217;t want to.  It takes a lot of effort, seriously.  I&#8217;m an antisocial gamer &#8211; we know this &#8211; I like playing games on my own, I hate chat and I hate voice-chats even more.  I don&#8217;t want to listen to somebody&#8217;s inane drivel while I shoot stuff, regardless of the content.  I ditched the <a title="[Gamer Diary] The Case of the MMOs – Boisterous Behaviour Abounds!" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/08/16/gamer-diary-the-case-of-the-mmos-boisterous-behaviour-abounds/" target="_blank">one MMO I played</a> a long time ago because of the racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic crap that occurred on a daily basis.  Not directed at me, just <em>there</em> &#8211; and no one really ever objected (if you did, you got the abuse turned on you).</p>
<p>My solution is not one that everyone can adopt.  I just avoid the social elements, even if it&#8217;s online team-based play like <strong>TF2</strong>, and I refuse to disclose any information about myself.  Generally, I am the wallpaper: I keep quiet and ignore chat.  This is mostly because I&#8217;m a misanthrope and do not care for being social, but partly it&#8217;s also because I know that a lot of people on chat are going to be dicks.  I just don&#8217;t understand why banter has to be offensive, even if it doesn&#8217;t go near questions of gender.</p>

<p>But back to the specific point of misogyny in the gamingverse.  I mentioned the KickStarter from <strong>Feminist Frequency</strong> in May&#8217;s &#8220;<a title="[Gamer Diary] – What I’ve Been Playing… May 2012" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/06/08/gamer-diary-what-ive-been-playing-may-2012/" target="_blank">Playing&#8230;</a>&#8221; post and the woman behind it, Anita Sarkeesian, has been yet another figurehead victim of abuse.  She put her head over that parapet, so to speak, and has had it all but <a title="New Statesman: Dear Internet, this is why you can't have nice things" href="http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/internet/2012/06/dear-internet-why-you-cant-have-anything-nice" target="_blank">shot to smithereens</a>.  Gladly, however, this isn&#8217;t going to stop her making those videos, nor <a title="KickStarter: Tropes vs women in video games" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/566429325/tropes-vs-women-in-video-games" target="_blank">has it stopped people pledging</a> (when I last checked, she was on $87,000+ with 68 hours left to go).  But this sort of thing does make me want to adopt a superhero persona, fly all over the world, and stand in defence of these women.</p>
<p>I was going to say &#8220;brave women&#8221; just ther, but that, to me, gives too much credit to these scum-sucking parasites of the internet.  It shouldn&#8217;t have to be brave just to identify as female and like games.  <strong>FFS</strong>.</p>
<p>At least &#8211; if we&#8217;re to take anything positive away from this &#8211; this all-too-common abuse is being given more and more of a public face.  A site that BBC article mentions is <strong><a title="Fat, Ugly or Slutty" href="http://fatuglyorslutty.com/" target="_blank">Fat,  Ugly or Slutty</a></strong><em> (because that&#8217;s pretty much all you are if you&#8217;re a female gamer, apparently)</em> where you can upload screengrabs of sexist abuse/harrasment.  So, if you can catch the abuse you receive, or see, in a screen grab or a recording, make it known!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I think shame is often strongly gendered; we are intended to feel it when we don't live up to our society's imposed, sexist expectations.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over 4 million people have seen <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCvmsMzlF7o">Brené Brown&#8217;s fantastic TED talk about Vulnerability</a>. She&#8217;s a researcher who looked into what successful people have in common, and found that they were all willing to make themselves vulnerable.</p>
<p>I was excited when she gave a follow-up talk in March, but I didn&#8217;t imagine I&#8217;d be posting about it on BadRep. The reason I am is that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psN1DORYYV0#t=15m0s">at 15.00 minutes</a>, it became ALL about gender. (I strongly recommend you check it out &#8211; both videos are excellent):</p>
<p>[<A href="http://youtu.be/psN1DORYYV0">We&#8217;re having trouble with embedding! Click this handy link instead!</a>]</p>
<p>Shame is often strongly gendered; we are intended to feel it when we don&#8217;t live up to our society&#8217;s imposed, sexist expectations. She cites a study from Boston College which got women to answer the question:</p>
<blockquote><p>What do women need to do to conform to female norms?</p></blockquote>
<p>The answers were: be Nice, Thin, Modest&#8230; and &#8216;Use all available resources for appearance&#8217;.</p>
<p>For men, they were: Always show emotional control, Work should be your priority, Pursue status&#8230; and &#8216;Violence&#8217;.</p>
<p>That they&#8217;re different answers for men and women should be enough to prove the need for some real changes in our society by itself, but that the actual points are also so disgusting just seals it for me. Nice. Thin. Don&#8217;t make a fuss. Physical appearance is everything. Emotionally cut off. Violent. Competitive. Judged hugely by job and status. <em>Not one of these things is good for society.</em> We could lose them all and it would only improve everyone&#8217;s lives. (Well, &#8216;nice&#8217; could be okay, if it were applied to the <em>more</em> powerful groups in society, but in terms of gender you&#8217;ve then still got the &#8216;chivalry&#8217; problem &#8211; that men can forget about power differences <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/01/25/keep-the-gift-pay-what-you-owe/">if they treat women &#8216;nicely&#8217;</a> while giving up nothing.)</p>
<p>Brown&#8217;s previous point had been that successful and happy people have to allow themselves the risk of being seen as weak, or to fail. However, in reaching that conclusion (and it&#8217;s definitely true), she only interviewed women. In this second talk she relates how a male fan pointed out to her that men often feel unable to choose this route.</p>
<blockquote><p>Shame feels the same for men and women, but it is organised by gender&#8230; </p>
<p>For men, shame is not a bunch of competing, conflicting expectations [as it is for women], shame is one: Do Not Be Perceived As Weak. </p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>Brené Brown</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The fan claims that it&#8217;s the women in his family who reinforce this for him. In terms of how strictly the two sets of &#8216;norms-to-conform-to&#8217; listed above are enforced, I often see that men have a lot more leeway in dropping one or two of them&#8230; but only if they replace them with &#8216;money&#8217;.</p>
<p>So the next time I&#8217;m looking for a shorthand example for why feminism is important, I&#8217;ll reference what people perceive as the <em>biggest</em> demands by society on who they are allowed to be. It&#8217;s a flawed, gender-binary test, but the fact that the public returned those answers counts for a lot. That a list so gendered and outrightly harmful to society should be the TOP pressures many of us seem to be facing is something we just don&#8217;t need. It may not be set in law, but <a href="http://nothingbutawordbag.wordpress.com/2012/04/22/gendered-marketing-really-gets-on-my-tits/" />this stuff is a strong daily message</a>.</p>
<p>&#8230;Which makes me want to find a solution. Well, first to scream F*** THAT and opt out, and <em>then</em> find a solution. Equality means removing this heinous bullshit for <em>everyone</em>. The goals listed as the top answers in that survey are both unattainable in size and harmful in practice, but what choice do we have? It&#8217;s fine for me to urge people to stop conforming, but for many if they do the reality is they&#8217;ll never pass a job interview again. (Although <a href="http://vagendamag.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/hair-not-musical.html">not shaving your armpits or legs sometimes works out just fine</a>). </p>
<p>I refuse to give up. Reducing inequality towards any gender is so fundamental to everyone&#8217;s happiness that stuff like this just makes me more determined to keep fighting: we&#8217;ve all got to keep educating each other, pushing for change and making the issues visible. Whether it&#8217;s about who they marry, if they have sex, issues of consent, or who their political leaders are, women have a lot less freedom than men <a href="http://www.womankind.org.uk/policy-and-resources/">internationally</a>. That&#8217;s not in dispute. Gender inequality is measurable. If you really can&#8217;t see it, you haven&#8217;t spent two seconds looking. Yes, I&#8217;m also concerned with the pressures sexism places on men, and I think these &#8216;norm lists&#8217; showcase exactly why there&#8217;s so much still to do for everybody.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Feminist TwitBomb, Deluxe Edition: #WHATAWOMANNEEDS]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>BUT WHAT DO WOMEN <em>REALLY</em> NEED?</p>
<p>Age old question, really, this one, and one where &#8220;want&#8221; and &#8220;need&#8221; are often made unhelpfully interchangable, just to make it EVEN SIMPLER.</p>
<p>Welcome back to Feminist TwitBomb, Deluxe Edition, in which we take a sexist <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/02/02/why-are-trending-topic-hashtags-so-sexist-part-1/">Twitter</a> <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/02/03/why-are-trending-topic-hashtags-so-sexist-part-2/">hashtag</a> and try and make it slightly less soul-harrowingly bleak by exploring its inherent absurdity, usually with caps lock, bad puns, and the sudden appearance of wildlife. Previously on this channel: how <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/04/02/found-feminism-fun-with-tips-for-ladies/"><strong>#TipsForLadies</strong> was skewered</a>.</p>
<h3>Abridged (But Still Frustrating) History Of The #WhatAWomanNeeds Question</h3>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>14th century:</strong> The Wife of Bath tells us one particular knight (and rapist) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XJCOmcKadQ">had a complicated time working it out</a>.</li>
<li><strong>1920s: </strong>Freud facetiously prattled about it (often <a href="http://quotes-lover.com/wp-content/uploads/the-great-question-that-has-never-been-answered-and-which-I-have-not-yet-been-able-to-answerdespite-my-thirty-years-of-research-into-feminine-soul-is-what-a-woman-want.jpg">available as a patronising e-card or rubbish Tumblr graphic</a>. Life=complete).</li>
<li><strong>1993: </strong>Tammy Wynette <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQv6zls6sw">warbled</a> &#8220;a ring on my finger and champagne on ice&#8221; at Elton John in a song helpfully titled <strong>A Woman&#8217;s Needs</strong>; if you are lucky enough to have these items to hand, I advise you to down the entire bottle before you try to listen.</li>
<li><strong>1999:</strong> Even Christina Aguilera <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpspGHeLOPE">is disappointingly lyrically coy about it</a> &#8211; the song is originally titled <strong>What A Girl Needs</strong> and renamed to <em>Wants</em> by the record label execs. FOR FEMINISM, I assume. (Either way, apparently the answer is &#8220;whatever her dude wants her to want/need&#8221;).</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>PROBLEMATIC, as <a href="http://isthisfeminist.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> might say.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all fine, though, guys, because TWITTER TO THE RESCUE. Eat your heart out, Sigmund, Xtina and Geoff, for the question will now be answered.</p>
<h2>#WhatAWomanNeeds</h2>
<p>An initial peek at the feed for this trending topic was a <em>little</em> bit unedifying. I&#8217;ve anonymised the authors because they&#8217;re really only being quoted for background. The fun comes later when you lot get involved.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Curves and long hair&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Does it matter where the hair is? Can it be in my nostrils?</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Endless closet space&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>FOR THE SKULLS OF THE FALLEN.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;a guy who will protect her like she&#8217;s his daughter, love her like she&#8217;s his wife, and respect her like she&#8217;s his mother.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Apart from the fact that many of us do not fancy these things at all (or men), this is a worryingly ambitious MAIDEN-MOTHER-CRONE SUPERCONFLATION, and I am <em>not</em> paying his therapy bill when shit gets too confusing.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;oven mittens&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230; hoo, boy, watch out, sisterhood. This dude&#8217;s a <em>serious</em> wordsmith.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;to meet One Direction&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Ah, shit. *throws up hands* <em>Busted. </em></p>
<p>You get the picture there, anyway: high time, we decided, for a cheering TwitBomb session.</p>

<p>(In a strictly non-imperialist way, mind: no colonial elephant-hunting or dodgy empiring here. The helmet will be ethically sourced in a fetching shade of electric blue fairtrade material and will mainly be worn by the aforementioned wisecracking mandrill. Whom I have named <em>Artemisia</em>.)</p>

Seriously. I cannot believe LEGO are still spraying all their &#8220;girl budget&#8221; on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Friends">pastel shades</a> whilst failing entirely to address the lack of ladypirates in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Pirates">this product&#8217;s</a> long and otherwise noble lineage. Yes, I know there was one or two. One or two is NOT ENOUGH.</p>
<p>It just fucks with my chi, that whole business, okay?</p>

<p>Stellar advice from one of the brilliant <a href="http://www.betterstrangersopera.com/">Better Strangers Opera</a> collective there. (The <a href="http://apocalypsegirlsguide.blogspot.co.uk/">Apocalypse Girls</a> would be proud.)</p>
<p>This next one actually broke into the Top Entries for this hashtag, which I frankly regard as one of my life&#8217;s crowning achievements so far. It&#8217;s sitting there, nestled loudly between Smug &#8220;Oven Mitts&#8221; Guy and Creepy Oedipal Posturings. It&#8217;s ruining the vibe of patronage-and-patronising quite nicely. Proud moment.</p>

A hat trick of pragmatism for us all from our own Markgraf. By the way, this team is never going to conduct a TwitBomb without reference to the noble pheasant at some point. No reason. It&#8217;s just better than ovens, chivalry and sleaze. And when these sorts of ridiculous generalisations continue to be hashtagged, surely anything goes.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["It is the responsibility of the player base as a whole - men and women - to root this out and set it on fire with extreme prejudice": Sarah C - one of our own resident LARP organisers and players, with a pile of crewing experience - concludes the debate on Women in LARP! ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi, I&#8217;m Sarah and I&#8217;m a Live Action Roleplayer. Following on from<a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/10/18/guest-post-thoughts-on-women-in-larp/"> a guest post we recently ran on the subject</a> we got a few responses from other folk who enjoy the hobby talking about their experiences &#8211; including <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/11/08/guest-post-women-and-larp-the-other-side-of-the-coin">this response to the original post</a>, which we ran yesterday. So we thought it might be a good idea if one of Team BadRep (that would be me) joined the discussion our guest bloggers have been having and wrote about LARP. Before I wade in with lots of personal anecdotes or analysis of game theory with respect to gender (and I can talk for <em>hours</em> on that), I thought I&#8217;d kick off by talking a bit about the comments from the original post.</p>
<p>The big issue appears to be around whether or not &#8220;LARP is sexist&#8221;, which is difficult to deal with because that&#8217;s a lot of games and a lot of players to tar with the same brush, whichever way you paint them. It is also, as one commentator pointed out, a little bit hard to seperate LARP and LARPers from the real world (where we all live), which IS sexist. Some of those sexist values are going to seep in, no matter how hard we try. And people do try. I talk to a lot of gamers and game designers about things I think they&#8217;re doing which might be seen as sexist, and a lot of the time those (rare) occurances are not being done on purpose. This doesn&#8217;t excuse it, but it does rather empower people who give a shit to improve things by talking about it more, and raising problems where they find them.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s really important to separate the design of a game (what it was intended to do) from the experience of playing it (how it feels to do it). This way, we can look at where and how a game may or may not succeed on being Not Sexist; after all, there&#8217;s a difference between a game being inherently sexist and<em> those who play it</em> sometimes behaving in ways which are sexist. I would argue that most LARP games are not desgined to be sexist, but that there can be sexist elements that occur within gameplay and that it is the responsibility of the player base as a whole &#8211; men and women &#8211; to root this out and set it on fire with extreme prejudice, as follows:</p>
<p>Get your fucking sexism out of my hobby. Now.</p>
<p>*Ahem*. Now, to business. </p>
<h3>Live Action Games: an Action-Drama Love Affair</h3>
<p>The subtitle for this is &#8220;why my cupboards are full of kit, costume and rubber swords for various pretend people&#8221;.</p>
<p>My own personal experience of playing has been very positive. LARP, for me, is about storytelling, play-acting, and a permission to explore different personas and world-views which I don&#8217;t normally get access to. I can also wear cool costumes, have magic powers and fight Epic Battles. That fact that I am a woman does not bar me from any of those things, although I would be lying if I said it didn&#8217;t colour my gaming experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Kiku-disturbing.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="8294" data-permalink="/2011/11/09/final-word-thoughts-from-a-woman-on-live-action-roleplay/kiku-disturbing/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Kiku-disturbing.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="300,200" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Me as a Teenage Samurai Geisha Undead Angel Of Vengence. This actually happened. Well, in LARP at least.

<p>I&#8217;ve played sexist characters, such as a matriarchal tribal leader in <a href="http://www.profounddecisions.co.uk"><strong>Maelstrom</strong></a> who assumed that anyone of importance was female. I&#8217;ve played characters who were victims of terrible, awful sexism; I&#8217;ve played downtrodden and abused prostitutes. I&#8217;ve also played characters who used their looks and feminine charms to their advantage. Conversely, I&#8217;ve played characters who would consider such actions ridiculous and to whom a sword or a well-placed word was the correct tool to use. I&#8217;ve even played characters whose gender and sexuality was, for the purposes of the gameworld, almost entirely absent, such as a human slave in a world where humans are uniformly seen as cattle to their orcish, elvish and dwarvish overlords &#8211; my gender was as important to the other characters as the gender of a table.</p>
<p>In short, I&#8217;ve played around a lot with gender and sexuality, and LARP has been a big enabler in exploring those roles. My one &#8220;bad&#8221; LARP experience revolved entirely around the race of my character, rather than her gender, and in fact the person who delivered that bad experience was female. In my experience, men who LARP tend to be more concerned with not being sexist than men in day-to-day. Perhaps because the man who leers at me whilst I&#8217;m at a bus stop does not fear me striking him down with a fireball. Or perhaps &#8211; optimistically, but possibly, maybe &#8211; the chap who LARPs has a much broader experience of women being in charge than men in real life.<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Ree-disturbing.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="8295" data-permalink="/2011/11/09/final-word-thoughts-from-a-woman-on-live-action-roleplay/apotheosis/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Ree-disturbing.jpg?fit=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="768,512" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;4&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Simon White&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS-1D Mark III&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1220790608&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Simon White&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;280&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;800&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.0015625&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;apotheosis&quot;}" data-image-title="Me as a Matriarchal Tribal Leader And Shaman Lioness.

<p>So, what does LARP have to offer women? First, a bit of a health warning.  &#8220;Women&#8221; is a broad category which we at BadRep Towers want to avoid using in a way that assumes all women want the same things. They don&#8217;t. Fortunately, in LARP, as in life, there are options. Even more fortunately, there are often more options in LARP than there are either in life or in most fantasy and science fictions. One of my major complaints about the FSF genre is that we create these amazing make-believe worlds but then populate them mostly with men. All too often women characters are whores, witches or princesses &#8211; prizes to be won or challenges to be overcome. <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/08/15/the-representation-of-women-in-fantasy-what%E2%80%99s-the-problem-a-guest-post-by-author-juliet-e-mckenna/">Check out the piece fantasy author Juliet McKenna wrote for us on the subject.</a> LARP lets you, the player, take control of these stereotypes and challenge, subvert or even explore them. You can become your own hero in a fantasy world. Which means you get to tell your own story how you want.</p>
<h3>Making LARP Work For Women?</h3>
<p>I have also written, crewed and managed live action games. A quick rundown includes <a href="http://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/odyssey;jsessionid=1a3xon27nu4gx?0"><strong>Odyssey</strong></a>, <a href="http://www.firecat-masquerade.com/winter/start"><strong>Winter in the Willows</strong></a>, <a href="http://www.victorianalrp.co.uk/index.php"><strong>Victoriana</strong></a> and some local systems, so I&#8217;ve got experience behind the curtain, as it were. I have noticed that I am in the minority. The vast majority of games are written and run by men &#8211; it&#8217;s much the same with anything nerd-based. I&#8217;m never quite sure why this is the case with LARP, given that young girls are almost magnetically attracted to games of Let&#8217;s Pretend and Dressing Up Boxes. I think that these little girls end up doing drama and the few boys that like dress-up (who often can&#8217;t do drama on account of it being seen as &#8220;girly&#8221;) created LARP to allow them to run away to a field, where no-one else could see them, and play dress-up. This is backed up by the fact that I often see young teenage boys at LARP events, but rarely young teenage girls. Any, even slightly more, scientific study into this would be appreciated.</p>
<p>With all due credit to the guys behind the Games Operations Desk (GOD &#8211; geddit?), there is absolutely a perception of the hobby as being profoundly white and male. This is not their fault. Let me repeat this: <em>this is not their fault</em>. What absolutely is their fault is any time when a game feels lacking in opportunities for women to enjoy it, and connect with the game as much as men. The absolute best way to work this out is to look at some game websites and then <em>play the games</em>.  Here&#8217;s what to look out for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Game Background</strong> &#8211; This is the blurb that tells you about the game and the gameworld. It&#8217;s like the back cover of a book or DVD. Gender-aware games should include both male and female example characters in their background documents so women players can see that there are parts for them to play. Pronouns are your friend &#8211; there should be instances of &#8220;he&#8221; <em>and</em> &#8220;she&#8221; &#8211; or my personal favourite, &#8220;they&#8221; and &#8220;their&#8221; &#8211; I like pronouns that include everybody. Game blurbs often include artwork and photographs, which should have a good selection of all kinds of characters; male, female and sometimes neutral. If the blurb doesn&#8217;t, or if anything makes you feel &#8220;put off&#8221; because of how they have described themselves, then don&#8217;t play that game. If you&#8217;re feeling brave, email the game designers and tell them why: I&#8217;ve done this and the response was very positive, including instances where I&#8217;ve received follow up emails from other game designers going &#8220;are we gender-aware enough, can you help?&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Character creation</strong> &#8211; this is the way in which you pick what sort of a person you will play, and it is almost always the same for men as it is for women. There are rarely, except in games which have a specific built-in sexism (few and far between), situtations in which a woman cannot play a certain type of character. Unlike me, aged 6, trying to participate in a game of cops and robbers with the boys who lived next door, being &#8220;a girl&#8221; does not stop you from picking up a gun. Refeshingly, I have never seen a character creation form with a section for &#8220;gender&#8221; which then negatively impacts my options if I select female. Women are fighters as much as they are wizards, healers, leaders and politicians. I&#8217;ve also played in lots of games where women have chosen to play male characters, and vice versa.</li>
<li><strong>There are all kinds of games; try several.</strong> There are big games and little games, games in fields for the weekend and games in a room above a pub for an afternoon. There are high fantasy games with magic, and gritty, realistic games with guns. Games for ten people and games for a thousand. There are games about fighting, games about battles of wits, games with long, complicated rules and systems, and games where you turn up and improvise your way along. LARP is becoming more and more a space to try out new ideas and new ways of playing around, many of which have their backgrounds more in theatre and performance than Games Workshop. There will probably be something that suits you.</li>
<li><strong>Ask Other Women Who Play.</strong> There are, when you get into it, a surprising number of women who LARP. The common perception is absolutely still that it&#8217;s &#8216;a male hobby&#8217;, but the reality is different. There are also a large number of women, like myself, who are very active and vocal in the hobby, and equally active and vocal about getting other women into the hobby. Ask us which games you might like.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This post was sent in by reader and commenter Ribenademon as a response to another earlier guest post, <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/10/18/guest-post-thoughts-on-women-in-larp/"><strong>Some Thoughts On Women In LARP</strong></a>. Quick trigger warning: this post discusses some quite graphic misogynist language.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, we&#8217;ll conclude the discussion that first post has generated with a post from our own team, since we&#8217;re no strangers to LARP ourselves&#8230;</em><sup><a href="/2011/11/08/guest-post-women-and-larp-the-other-side-of-the-coin/#footnote_0_8034" id="identifier_0_8034" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" OK, not all of us. But a significant amount &ndash; about a third of the team &ndash; have LARPed at some point in their lives. Geek power at BadRep Towers! ">1</a></sup></p>
<p>LARP is sexist in the same way that many things we can know and touch in our society are sexist. It&#8217;s a broad sweep to say it is primarily played by white, male, ostensibly middle class individuals often lacking in social skills and hygiene, and it&#8217;s increasingly not true or fair to do so.</p>

I&#8217;ve been LARPing for about 11 years now.  It&#8217;s probably also appropriate to point out that I am a cis male and therefore I won&#8217;t experience sexism &#8211; at least, not in any way comparable to most female players. </p>
<p>LARP is, primarily, a male-dominated game &#8211; just on the basis of who attends. Women can and do come and play, but as Al notes in his post, it is often (though not exclusively) as tag-along girlfriend characters. Women who subvert this and succeed in the game, whilst sometimes respected, often become more of a target for &#8220;PVP&#8221; (&#8220;player versus player&#8221; conflict) than male players succeeding in the same manner, simply because they&#8217;ve deviated from an assigned social position.</p>
<p>In a highly anecdotal and unscientific manner I&#8217;m now going to list a few instances of sexist and/or straight up misogynist behaviour I&#8217;ve witnessed whilst LARPing. I&#8217;m listing them because I feel they most accurately depict common manifestations of sexism within LARP, and I promise they&#8217;re all true. They&#8217;re absolutely not true of every male player, but they do definitely exist and they&#8217;re not rare like a dinosaur. They&#8217;re also not especially true of one system over another.  </p>
<h3>&#8220;Humour&#8221; and Misogyny</h3>
<p>First off, myself and a NPC (non-player character) were standing around during a major Lorien Trust game watching people walk by. Half a dozen teenage girls in ballgowns walked past us. They were pretty smiley and seemed to be having a laugh in the sunshine.</p>
<p><strong>NPC:</strong> Aww, look at them! Don&#8217;t they look all bless and nice!<br />
<strong>Me:</strong> Aww, yeah!<br />
<strong>NPC:</strong> Fair play though, as soon as they hit the stroke of 16 they&#8217;re going to get the living fuck raped out of them.<br />
<strong>Me:</strong> WTF?!</p>
<p>The untyped climax of this story is that I said that this was not a cool or acceptable thing to say, and I did not think it was on. It had definitely been said in such a way as to suggest that such abuse would be quite desirable/fun were it to take place. My reaction caused a significant souring of attitude towards me both from the individual I had this exchange with and also from the people generally around this person &#8211; it was felt that I was making a fuss over nothing and should just &#8220;take a joke&#8221;. I&#8217;ve heard similar comments from other individuals and small groups, as far as I can remember though only when there was no female player or female member of staff around to overhear.</p>
<p>I can also cite numerous cases where a &#8220;provocatively&#8221; dressed female player was scorned and massively disparaged for &#8220;being a slag&#8221;. This often seems especially likely to happen if she has achieved some kind of success in the game, and it&#8217;ll range from jokes about what &#8220;whorish behaviour&#8221; must have taken place to get said advantages to just straight up behind-the-back savaging:</p>
<p><strong>Male Player 1:</strong> Yeah, I hear she&#8217;s a virgin.<br />
<strong>Male Player 2:</strong>  At this event, maybe.<br />
<strong>Male Player 3:</strong> If we went to kill her character, we could be half way through and then be like &#8220;OK, we won&#8217;t kill you if you suck us off&#8221;.<br />
<strong>Male Player 4: </strong>Then kill her anyway afterwards. If she complains to a ref just say she&#8217;s trying to get out of being killed because she&#8217;s a cheating bitch.</p>
<p>This sort of shared humour goes way beyond risky &#8220;laddish&#8221; jokes told privately amongst men, and in some cases actively steps towards hate. It also suggests that actual sexist action &#8211; even where it is less extreme than the above &#8211; is more and more being seen as okay (or desired?) at LARP amongst some parties.  </p>
<h3>Gender Roles</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s already been identified that women can play prostitutes or healers in many systems, and that alternatively they can make a push into a more &#8216;competitive&#8217; character that is less traditionally &#8216;feminine&#8217; (at least in terms of many LARPs&#8217; <em>expectation</em> of what is appropriate for a woman to play). Women who choose these characters may find they are competing with male player characters in a way that male characters do not have to. A male character that is not a caricature or inversion of masculinity can compete with any other character on the strengths and weaknesses of their character. A female player character, unless she wants to be ignored outside her group of mates in roleplay, can expect to be treated principally as a woman rather than as a magician or a priest or whatever else first &#8211; unless she is particularly vigorous IC and manages to defy being categorised as some kind of &#8220;slag&#8221; &#8211; or indeed &#8220;just&#8221; a female.</p>

<h3>Casual Sexism</h3>
<p>The above are fairly extreme examples of nastiness I&#8217;ve seen happen at LRP events, but there&#8217;s also milder general and casual sexism. Pleasingly, this sometimes goes wrong. About two years ago I was at an event where four very hard, very killy male combat characters all died from drinking the poison that a corseted and large breasted female character served them from a bottle of mead when she came into their camp. This is quite believable &#8211; boys are often stupid, and many like breasts, whilst also assuming that &#8220;girls are bound to be harmless&#8221;. A few camps down? Oh, how we laughed.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a good line in utilising sexism in this way that can be done by women at LARP events, although this is still arguably a hideous cop-out in terms of actually being able to play the same game as male players, on top of whether you find it distasteful or not. Some (usually) female players create characters who work in the in-character sex industry, the background to which rarely involves STIs, violence, drug abuse, sexual assault or any of the other issues of the real world sex industry. <a href="http://forum.rule7.co.uk/Topic116276-37-1.aspx?Highlight=sex">This is an interesting thread</a> off of the infamous Rule 7 forums about how to play through the in-character sex industry with &#8220;sex&#8221; as both a business transaction and a romantic interaction.  </p>
<p>It also cuts (very, very slightly) both ways: as a male player, I&#8217;ve played character types who were meant to be without gender or sexuality and found that some female players attempted to use what I&#8217;ve perceived as out-of-character flirting when interacting with me, probably because as a male player I&#8217;m perceived as potentially at least a bit sexist in my behaviour. A more advanced manifestation of sexism in LARP is what I like to think of as &#8220;harem&#8221; behaviour. This is where a female player deliberately cultivates around her &#8211; both in and out of character &#8211; a small collection of young men that follow her around and who do what she wants &#8211; in a way that I think is often distinct from simply being a female group leader with group members who happen to be male. I think I can see in this a recognition that some women feel they can&#8217;t compete in the same way as male players because of sexist attitudes and general uncomfortable treatment. Instead they may feel the need to cultivate a group of male characters to act through &#8211; or to provide enough security to roleplay with the rest of the field in such a way that is insulated on their terms, without being either leched at or just ignored. </p>
<h3>In LARP and in Life</h3>
<p>I think my main issue and argument is that all the examples above translate neatly across from real life. Sexism does happen a lot in real life, but there is an increasing social and political movement backed up by law to reduce and prevent discrimination. However, in a LARP game, there is only what players and system are prepared to step up against and say &#8220;NO&#8221; to. There is no standard of behaviour that can really be expected to be enforced beyond the absolutes of &#8220;no out of character violence&#8221;. This means people are free to avoid rewarding female characters in-game and can also get out of taking them seriously. If someone behaves in a sexist way, people might think less of them but often there&#8217;s still no threat of consequence. The behaviour that often goes on in the field, if it were relocated to an office, would result in investigation and employment tribunals, which illustrates how some men are able to get away with treating women in the field in a way they might not always in real life.</p>
<h3>The Plus Side</h3>
<p>Things are getting better &#8211; in real life, many men and women are increasingly unimpressed with sexism. Male and female staff exist in senior roles in more and more systems. One LARP system I&#8217;ve heard has allegedly cancelled the contract of a catering company at its festivals because of numerous complaints about its staff standing around loudly making rape jokes with customers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s certainly unfair to say that every man who plays is sexist or hates women, or agrees with the things they hear their mates say when standing around in the dark at an event. It&#8217;s just as unfair to say that every woman that plays is either a victim suffering from sexism, encouraging sexism in some way or having to engage with sexism all the time. It also wouldn&#8217;t be right to say that every female player is actively engaged in dealing with or fighting their way past sexism all the time as they try to enjoy the game &#8211; most of the time people care more about killing the undead, and a lot of the time sexism does not come up. After all, it wouldn&#8217;t be much of a fun game if it was always horrible. When it does go wrong, though, fantasy can be just as bad as some of reality.  </p>
<p>I would advise women that are into sci-fi or fantasy to go LARPing if they like the sound of it &#8211; I think it&#8217;s awesome &#8211; but I wouldn&#8217;t sell it to them as a completely optimistic, prejudice free, potentially feminist activity &#8211; at least, not any more or less than any other male dominated hobby.</p>

<li><em><strong>Ribenademon</strong> has been larping for 11 years since starting at university. He is very tall with laser beams for eyes; once mainly a purple demon, he now more often resembles a tall and angry tree focussing its efforts on fighting imaginary imperialism and colonialism, all the while appeasing its dark god. He also clearly spends too much time thinking about LARP. He looks forward to sacrificing you regardless of your gender.</em> </li>
