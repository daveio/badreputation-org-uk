										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6 style="text-align: center;">Q</h6>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">QUEEN</h2>
<blockquote><p>To sour your happiness, I must report<br />
The queen is dead.</p>
<p>Shakespeare, <strong>Cymbeline </strong>(1611) V.5.3400</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Queen </em>is one of the few Alphabet words with a firmly British<em> </em>origin, but it makes up for its lack of Latinate pedigree by being extremely complicated. So this is the part where the rap breaks down &#8211; it comes from the Old English <em>cwen</em>, the proto-Germanic <em>kwoeniz</em>, and (follow it back far enough) the proto-Indo-European <em>gwen</em> (= &#8216;woman, wife&#8217;). Proto-awesome, man. In this form it coincides rather nicely with the Greek <em>gyne</em>, meaning &#8216;woman, wife&#8217; (thus <em>gynecology</em>, <em>misoGYNy</em>, <em>gynophobia</em>, and indeed <em>gynocentric</em>), and a whole host of other languages that I don&#8217;t think we need all up in our grill just now.</p>
<h3>My Family and Other Animals</h3>
<p>The interesting thing about these origins is their relation to another word: <em>quean</em>, originally a variant form of <em>queen</em>, meaning then &#8216;woman, female&#8217; but now mostly an &#8216;effeminate homosexual man&#8217; (cf., er, <em>queen</em>). Its etymology is similar, but with more emphasis on the insults: thus, <em>quean</em>&#8216;s forebears include the Middle Dutch <em>quene </em>(= &#8216;older woman&#8217;), the Dutch <em>kween </em>(= &#8216;hussy&#8217;) and the Middle Low German <em>quene </em>(= &#8216;woman, wife, old woman&#8217;). It eventually gives us &#8216;a promiscuous woman&#8217; sometime around the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>As is often the case, plenty of forebears inevitably only leads to plenty of embarrassing cousins, and many of these roots (<em>cwen </em>and the Greek <em>gyne </em>in particular) have also been claimed as parents to <em>cunt</em> ( =  &#8216;the vulva or vagina&#8217;), spelled <em>quaint </em>and sometimes <em>queynt </em>by Chaucer, just to illustrate the fluidity of &#8216;cw&#8217;, &#8216;qu&#8217; and &#8216;cu&#8217;. When you know that <em>portcwene </em>( = literally &#8216;a public woman&#8217;) means &#8216;prostitute&#8217;, the association of <em>quean / quean </em>and <em>cunt </em>may perhaps become somewhat clearer: it&#8217;s what you might call <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synecdoche">synecdoche</a>. This may also throw some light on <em>quean/queen</em>&#8216;s gay associations: inevitably, words that suggest penetration of the female (<em><a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/01/31/an-alphabet-of-femininism-16-p-is-for-pussy/">pussy</a>, bitch</em>) are eventually seized upon to denigrate an &#8216;effeminate&#8217; man. <em>Queen </em>as &#8216;a flamboyant homosexual&#8217; is from the 1920s (as is <em>queer</em>, which originally means &#8216;oblique, off centre&#8217;), thus coinciding with a modicum more gay visibility than its sixteenth century usage.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 13px;"> </span></p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not all doom, gloom and back to the Unmentionables: let&#8217;s talk thrones. English is unusual in giving a <em>queen </em>her own word, and not simply feminizing <em>king </em>(= &#8216;of noble birth&#8217;) &#8211; compare the French <em>roi </em>and <em>reine</em>, from the Latin <em>rex </em>and <em>regina. </em>Nonetheless, the first definition of a <em>queen </em>in the dictionary is as &#8216;a king&#8217;s wife or consort; a lady who is wife to a king&#8217; but the second sense, as &#8216;a woman who is the chief ruler of a state, having the same rank and position as a king&#8217;, is Old English itself, so the two definitions are likely to be essentially simultaneous.</p>
<h3>The English the English the English are best.</h3>
<p>Yes, over here on Albion&#8217;s chalk-ringed shores, we&#8217;ve had no less than seven reigning <em>queens</em>. By contrast, even pre-1789, the hated French would never let Ringo have a go &#8211; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salic_law">lol Salic law</a> – and all their famous female royals were lowly consorts (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_of_Valois">Margaret de Valois</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_de'_Medici">Catherine de Medici</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Antoinette">Marie Antoinette</a>&#8230;), although <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_IV_of_France">Henri IV</a> was several degrees more awesome than any English king, ever. <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_RMP5gGGaNA0/SdS53BcjXSI/AAAAAAAAC6g/hH7lkbHAZhw/s320/henry-iv.jpg">Look at how pleased with himself he is</a>! But I digress.</p>
<p>However positive the existence of historical female monarchs on this <a href="http://www.quotes.net/quote/5427">royal throne of kings, this sceptr&#8217;d isle</a>, the residual physicality of <em>queen </em>in relation to <em>cunt </em>is still lurking around, and the body of the <em>queen </em>has always carried a significance that goes beyond everyday concerns about legitimacy (although those are there too). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_of_Aragon">Catherine of Aragon</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_of_Cleves">Anne of Cleves</a>, queens to Henry VIII, were both publicly subjected to a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/oct/30/catherine-aragon-giles-tremlett-review">series of intimate questions</a> (and threatened physical examination) about their wedding-bed virginity, genital health and sexual history, and that&#8217;s before you get into discussions down the pub throughout history about When The King Is A Queen (thus <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_II_of_England#Edward_and_Piers_Gaveston">Edward II</a> roundly condemned for A Weak King and put to an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_II_of_England#Death">&#8216;ironic&#8217; death</a>), and the reigning <em>queen</em>&#8216;s menstrual cycle and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_of_Modena#Queen_.281685.E2.80.931689.29">likelihood of producing a royal heir</a>.</p>
<p>This last was an issue that clearly dogged even those English queens ruling in their own right: in 1554, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_I_of_England">Mary I</a> was declared to be with child, triggering thanksgiving services and country-wide celebration, until over a year later her belly decreased in size and the &#8216;pregnancy&#8217; was revealed to be a humiliating &#8216;phantom&#8217; (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_pregnancy">pseudocyesis</a>), caused by her intense desire for an heir. After a second false pregnancy two years later, she died (possibly from a uterine tumour) in 1558.</p>

<p>A couple of hundred years later, amid some of the most spectacular changes in British history, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_II_of_England">Mary &#8216;Williamanmary&#8217; II</a> and her<em> </em>sister, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne,_Queen_of_Great_Britain">Anne</a>, were competing to be the first to bear a child, and, in consequence, were rarely on speaking terms. Mary had an early miscarriage which may have permanently impaired her ability to have a baby, while Anne (despite being fairly definitely gay herself) had six children who died, eight still-births and four miscarriages. Meanwhile, a few Georges and a William later, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Victoria">Victoria</a>&#8216;s famous fruitfulness was widely seen as a positive statement about British greatness in an imperial age: the truly maternal monarch, whose offspring gave England royal relations in Hesse, Prussia (though post-1914 we didn&#8217;t talk about that), and Russia (oops).</p>
<h3>Queen Of My Heart.</h3>
<p>But, of course, we (along with everyone else, ho ho) have not touched on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_I_of_England">Elizabeth I</a>, the &#8216;Virgin Queen&#8217;, Gloriana, etc who managed to make a virtue of childlessness by representing the immaculate body of the queen as the symbol of a healthy nation. Bang on cue, <em>queen</em>&#8216;s third meaning is &#8216;a female whose rank or pre-eminence is comparable to that of a queen; applied, for example, to the Virgin Mary, to the goddesses of ancient religions or mythologies, or to a woman as a term of endearment or honour&#8217;. This is the sense it has in <strong>Twelfth Night </strong>when Viola is &#8216;Orsino&#8217;s mistress and his fancy&#8217;s <em>queen</em>&#8216;, in which context it has something of <em><a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/12/20/an-alphabet-of-femininism-12-l-is-for-lady/">lady</a> </em>about it, just ramped up to full throttle: someone who is also the &#8216;chief  ruler of a state&#8217; is indeed a mistress <em>par excellence.</em></p>
<p>It was this tradition that Elizabeth milked till it had no more to give, presenting herself as the adored <em>lady </em>at the centre of a courtly cult of virginity, an age which produced Edmund Spenser&#8217;s <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Faerie_Queene">The Faerie Queene</a></strong> and Walter Raleigh&#8217;s <strong><a href="http://www.luminarium.org/renlit/oceanintro.htm">The Ocean To Cynthia</a></strong>, as well as hundreds of portraits depicting Queen Elizabeth<em> </em>as immaculate goddess and virgin. Her fleshlessness was only exacerbated after 1592, when the elderly<em> queen</em> stopped sitting for portraits at all, forcing artists to work from earlier templates of her face, creating an eternal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portraiture_of_Elizabeth_I_of_England#The_last_sitting_and_the_Mask_of_Youth">&#8216;Mask of Youth&#8217;</a>.</p>
<p>So <em>queen </em>is a word that fuses sexuality and a microscopic focus on the body (where more so than in its use to attack people for what they like to do in the bedroom?) with a kind of awestruck &#8216;Glorianian&#8217; respect. Those who sit on this lexical pedestal are perhaps a little wonky: it is unfortunate that <em>queenly</em> success seems attainable only for those rulers who have produced litters of miniature monarchs and the one who maintained a virginal ice-princess sort of deal. But then, looking back over England&#8217;s history (and, of course, its present), it is cheering to see that Women Have At Least Done It. Now if we could just fix that male primogeniture business&#8230;</p>
