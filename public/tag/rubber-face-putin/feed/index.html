										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A wise man<sup><a href="/2012/10/22/found-feminism-rubber-face-putin/#footnote_0_12353" id="identifier_0_12353" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" Terry Pratchett, THUD (particularly in the form of Granny Weatherwax, he&rsquo;s the source of a lot of useful moral philosophy). ">1</a></sup> once said that you ignore the writing on the walls at your peril. I hope the same is true of stickers.</p>
<p>In a world where it&#8217;s increasingly hard to get your message across, and available methods of communication are becoming more and more sophisticated, it&#8217;s refreshing to see a return to the simple things in life.</p>
<p>Like slapping a sticker somewhere nice and prominent that screams <em>FREE PUSSY RIOT</em> in fat felt tip pen.</p>
<p>I found this beauty a couple of months ago whilst walking across the Golden Jubilee pedestrian bridge. Sitting loud and proud, obviously homemade, with bright colours and a take-no-prisoners message.</p>

<p>So, why is this a Found Feminism?</p>
<p>Well, obviously there&#8217;s the show of support for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pussy_Riot" target="_blank">Pussy Riot</a> and the spreading of their message. Whoever slapped this on the wall was inspired to make and display the sticker themselves. I hope there are hundreds of them stuck around London. I only found the one. I hope other people find more. I hope they make their own.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also going to add points for the artwork, done in a way that echoes feminist punk stylings. It&#8217;s that hand-drawn aesthetic of &#8220;we did this in our bedroom&#8221; personal creation. It mirrors the hand-knitted balaclavas of the band members, and it&#8217;s the heart and soul of grassroots movements.</p>
<p>Plus, it&#8217;s funny.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying that feminism should be side-splitting all the time, although I do dislike that stereotype about feminists as po-faced, dungarees-wearing, yoghurt-plaiting monsters<sup><a href="/2012/10/22/found-feminism-rubber-face-putin/#footnote_1_12353" id="identifier_1_12353" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" Actually, I really like dungarees, and would quite happily wear them, especially for their iconic status in (mis)representing feminism. But that&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m a real person and not a stereotype! I cannot plait yoghurt, however. ">2</a></sup> who hate all fun and all jokes. But being able to make someone smile when you get your point across can be valuable &#8211; and who wouldn&#8217;t grin at this sticker, with its cheerful two fingers up to one of the most terrifying and powerful men in the world? Doesn&#8217;t matter how strong you think you are, Mr Putin &#8211; the writing on the wall in London thinks you&#8217;re a dick.</p>
<p>Finally, there&#8217;s the political message here. The sticker, and Pussy Riot, are part of a rekindling of the political power of feminism, reminding us all that there&#8217;s more we can do (much, much more) than form elegant critiques of the use of the female nude in art for the Sunday edition of the national newspapers.</p>
<p>There are problems out in the world that an active, aware and politicised feminist movement can work to solve. Should work to solve. And the fact that someone with a few highlighter pens and a handful of stickers is getting out there and having a go, in their own way, at doing it should put a rocket under those of us who have more reach and power to do what we can.</p>
<p>So yeah, fuck rubber face Putin.</p>

<li>Check out the website <a href="http://freepussyriot.org/">Free Pussy Riot</a> for news and how you can get involved.</li>
<li>Our Rhian wrote on Pussy Riot when they first appeared in the UK national press <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/02/06/revolting-women-slight-return-russias-pussy-riot/" target="_blank">here</a>, and again after the trial <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/09/19/pussy-riot-revisited/" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
