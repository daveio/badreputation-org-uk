					<description><![CDATA[If you remember the Alphabet of Feminism, this one's for you. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Ed&#8217;s note:</strong> In the original Alphabet we did <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/10/18/an-alphabet-of-femininism-3-c-is-for-crinoline/" target="_blank">&#8216;C is for Crinoline&#8217;</a> &#8211; but here&#8217;s something we thought was topically worth coming back to.</p>
<h6 style="text-align: center;">C</h6>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">CHIVALRY</h2>
<blockquote><p>Chivalry is dead, but you&#8217;re still kinda cute.</p>
<p>&#8211; Nelly Furtado, <strong>Promiscuous</strong> (2006)</p></blockquote>
<p>Chivalry. Not one of feminism&#8217;s most pressing issues, but definitely one of its more genteel <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/01/25/keep-the-gift-pay-what-you-owe/" target="_blank">debates</a>.</p>
<p>Do you, as an attractive female who also happens to be a feminist, deign to take the seat that dude offers you on the crowded tube or laugh hollowly and stick your head back in your neighbour&#8217;s armpit? Is chivalry OK?</p>
<p>Personally, my view on this debate is always affected by the point that 99% of the men I&#8217;ve met who talk about chivalry with misty-eyed fervour are also the kind of Nice Guys who Really Aren&#8217;t Very Nice At All.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not for here.</p>
<p>What I am interested in is looking at its complex linguistic heritage.</p>
<h2>Horses</h2>
<p>What&#8217;s that sound in the distance?</p>
<p>Why, it&#8217;s the sound of clopping hooves &#8211; and<em> chivalry</em>&#8216;s etymological root come to join us. Neiiigh.</p>

<p>For though <em>chivalry<strong> </strong></em>in English means (first definition ahoy!)  &#8216;the code of behaviour demonstrated<em> by a perfect knight</em>&#8216;, were we French we&#8217;d replace &#8216;knight&#8217; with &#8216;<em>chevalier</em>&#8216;, or &#8216;horseman&#8217; &#8211; from the root word <em>cheval</em> (= &#8216;horse&#8217;).</p>
<p>The knight, or <em>chevalier</em>, is <em> </em>in origin a nobleman on horseback who goes around rescuing maidens and fighting dragons. He is <em>chivalrous </em>in behaviour, displaying (the word&#8217;s second definition) &#8216;courage, honour, justice and readiness to help the weak&#8217;.</p>
<p>Key examples can be found in the legends of King Arthur and his horsebacked Knights of the Round Table &#8211; in particular Sir Gawain and the so-good-he-couldn&#8217;t-be-gooder Sir Percival (who later becomes Wagner&#8217;s <strong>Parsifal</strong>).</p>
<p>The chivalrous are those on horseback.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s the secondary meaning of <em>chivalry</em> that we best recognise today: &#8216;<em>courteous</em> behaviour, especially towards women&#8217; (that is, giving up your seat on the tube, which Percival would totally have done if he didn&#8217;t travel everywhere by <em>cheval</em>).<em> </em></p>
<h2>Courtly-powered lovin&#8217;</h2>
<p>Chivalry &#8211; and the <em>courtesy </em>that defines it &#8211; is also the base idea behind <em>courtly</em> <em>love</em>, which the devoted may remember we addressed separately in the <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/12/20/an-alphabet-of-femininism-12-l-is-for-lady/" target="_blank">Alphabet Glory Days</a>.</p>

<p>This is what the knights are doing when they&#8217;re not out fighting &#8211;  sighing for love among rose bushes, swooning at the touch of a <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/11/01/an-alphabet-of-femininism-5-e-is-for-emancipate/" target="_blank">&#8216;lily-white hand&#8217;</a> and <em>definitely </em>giving up their seats for a woman on the medieval commute.</p>
<p>And it was said to have been invented by a woman, Eleanor of Aquitaine.</p>
<p>Before she married Henry II and brought her French customs over to England, Eleanor had a period presiding alone over a predominantly male grouping in Poitiers.It seems inventing an elaborate code of chaste devotion to a single lady &#8211; <em>court</em>eous behaviour, if you will &#8211; was a good way for Eleanor to bring these bored and potentially restless knights into order &#8211; and, I assume, to block potential sexual aggression at the same time (cf. the court of Elizabeth I, which saw a resurgence of &#8216;courtly&#8217; devotion to &#8216;Gloriana&#8217;, the &#8216;Virgin <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/02/07/an-alphabet-of-femininism-17-q-is-for-queen/" target="_blank">Queen</a>&#8216;).</p>
<h2>Courtship</h2>
<p>With these courtly roots, it&#8217;s appropriate that, during the English Civil War, the word <em>chevalier </em>should lend itself so enthusiastically to the Royalist cause in fighting for king (and court).</p>
<p>In this context, the Cavaliers were enemies to the Roundheads and cousins to <em>chevaliers</em> via the Latin source-word &#8216;cabellarius&#8217; (also meaning &#8216;horseman&#8217;).</p>
<p>The origin of this term is actually pre-war, in the grouping of courtly &#8216;cavaliers&#8217; at the original Carolingian court (a bit like the courtly lovers at Poitiers).</p>
<p>These included the &#8216;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavalier_poet" target="_blank">Cavalier poets</a>&#8216;, a conglomerate of literary courtiers formed by the King himself, including Robert Herrick and Edmund Waller.</p>
<p>The term in this usage is ambiguous, though. On the one hand, <em>cavalier</em> was often used in allusion to the King&#8217;s refined (indeed &#8216;knightly&#8217;) sensibilities, which, incidentally, included a famous love of horses &#8211; as the many magnificent equestrian portraits of him attest.</p>
<p>But, in a pejorative sense, the <em>cavalier poets </em>were so named because they were famously &#8216;roistering gallants&#8217; and &#8216;libertines&#8217;. This is <em>cavalier</em>&#8216;s other meaning: &#8216;haughty, disdainful or supercilious&#8217; or &#8216;offhand and unceremonious&#8217; (a bit like wearing your hat at a<a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/02/14/an-alphabet-of-femininism-18-r-is-for-rake/" target="_blank"> &#8216;rakish&#8217; angle</a>).</p>
<p>So <em>cavalier </em>is almost a contraction in terms.</p>
<h2>The Don</h2>
<p>This is the very ambiguity we find in Mozart&#8217;s great libertine opera, <strong>Don Giovanni</strong>, written about 100 years later. The &#8216;Don&#8217; is a nobleman and serial womaniser. He&#8217;s a standard-issue<a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/02/14/an-alphabet-of-femininism-18-r-is-for-rake/" target="_blank"> rake</a>, in fact: we learn in the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fccdGBi9JUs&amp;t=2m30s" target="_blank">Catalogue Song</a> that he&#8217;s seduced 1,003 women in Spain alone.</p>

<p>He is throughout referred to in the Italian as a &#8216;cavalier&#8217;, understood (and, for us English-speakers, translated) according to context variously as &#8216;gentleman&#8217; (nobleman on horseback) and &#8216;rake&#8217; (careless womaniser) &#8211; as in the opera&#8217;s subtitle, &#8216;Il <em>dissoluto</em> punito&#8217; (&#8216;the debauchee punished&#8217;).</p>
<p>Thus, when Don Giovanni takes the pretty peasant girl Zerlina away from her finance, Masetto, to show her his castle (no, really), Don Giovanni &#8216;reassures&#8217; the jealous Masetto by saying he needn&#8217;t worry &#8211; his fiancee is &#8216;in the hands of a <em>cavalier</em>&#8216;.Unfortunately, that&#8217;s exactly what Masetto is afraid of. &#8220;Let the<em> cavaliere </em>make a <em>cavaliera</em> out of you!&#8221; he trumpets at the departing Zerlina &#8211; he knows what&#8217;s going down (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q40a23gfxZE" target="_blank">this</a>).</p>
<h2>Court to City</h2>
<p>Back to English climes.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the eighteenth century, Queen Anne halved the size of the English court and moved it out of central London.</p>
<p>In so doing, she ultimately ended up transferring power from court to city &#8211; and <em>courtesy </em>became <em></em>civility (from the Latin <em>cives</em> (= the city)).</p>

<p>This is the age of opening doors, watching your language and standing up when a woman enters the room. Chivalry has gone domestic; men are <em>civil </em>now in Britain. Only the hot-headed Italian Don Giovannis are still <em>cavaliers</em>.</p>
<p>But when Samuel Richardson wanted to depict a perfect (but domestic) Englishman, he still made him an aristocratic knight (<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sir</span> Charles Grandison</strong>). Jane Austen did too: her paragon of virtue (himself based on Sir Charles), is pointedly named Mr <em>Knightly</em> (<strong>Emma</strong>).By this point it&#8217;s faded away to a name rather than a title, but the gentleman still has a vestigial horse (if you will).</p>
<h2>White Knights</h2>
<p>Strangely enough, the vestigial horse becomes more literal in the modern age, in the form of the ladies&#8217; proverbial &#8216;ideal man&#8217; &#8211; a chivalrous gentleman. Mr Right is also a &#8216;knight in shining armour&#8217;.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s even a  Lewis Carroll-esque &#8216;White Knight&#8217;, a noble rescuer (as in the song &#8216;My White Knight&#8217; from Meredith Wilson&#8217;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_oyzwsJOhU" target="_blank"><strong>The Music Man</strong></a>, where the knight in question will, her mother thinks, &#8216;save&#8217; Marian the Librarian from Old Maidery).</p>
<p>Remember when Grace first meets Leo &#8211; the Great Romance &#8211; in <strong>Will and Grace</strong>? He&#8217;s on a horse in Central Park. That&#8217;s how you know he&#8217;s a Big Deal Romance.</p>
<h2>Never trust a man on horseback</h2>
<p>And, to conclude very crudely, I suppose this is what happened to <em>chivalry </em>.</p>
<p>It became the polite behaviour of the  gentleman &#8211; enshrined in tradition and developed over a couple of hundred years to become our friend offering me a seat on the bustling 21st century commute<strong> </strong>and sitcom single girls dreaming of their &#8216;Mr Darcy&#8217;.</p>
<p>But I still hear the sound of clopping hooves. The fantasy may be more Sir Gawain than Don Giovanni, but you know what they say &#8211; the apple never falls far from the lexical tree.</p>

<p>Pixar&#8217;s first full length movie with a female protagonist is less than four months away from release. And, <a href="http://io9.com/5887598/watch-the-first-scene-from-pixars-brave-now">as io9 reported last week</a>, the first scene is now previewable:</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/JOmc2GzWtSE" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>I&#8217;m really excited. ENGAGE INITIAL BURBLE-O-METER:</p>
<h3>HURRAH!</h3>
<ul>
<li>I remain so, so pleased to see a Pixar movie from the point of view of a girl character. Without exception, the entire Pixar canon &#8211; which I&#8217;m a huge, boxset-toting, scene-quoting fan of, for the record &#8211; features male protagonists, and while <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessie_(Toy_Story)">Jessie</a>, <a href="http://pixar.wikia.com/Dory">Dory</a>, and <a href="http://pixar.wikia.com/Ellie_Fredricksen">Ellie</a> (who determines much of <strong>Up</strong>&#8216;s story even though it&#8217;s via her absence) are all fun and compelling sidekick or partner characters, I&#8217;ve been waiting for Pixar to place a female character centre-stage. And now, after over 20 years, we&#8217;ve got one in the shape of Princess Merida, headstrong Scottish medieval archery whizz. </li>
<li>Placing a female character centre-stage, of course, is not the be-all and end-all. Disney&#8217;s been doing it for years with their fairytale movies and resultant &#8220;princess&#8221; brand. They&#8217;ve finally brought the curtain down on their run of &#8220;princess&#8221; films with 2010&#8217;s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0398286/"><strong>Tangled</strong></a>, which I thought was charmingly smart, sassy and very happy, to a point, to send up its own canon. But it still operated very much within the constraints of that canon &#8211; it was, in places, a bit like <strong>Legally Blonde</strong> in Fairytale Land &#8211; and I&#8217;m hoping this will bust the box open juuuust a bit more.</li>
<h3>BROW-FURROW!</h3>
<li>I think it&#8217;s interesting that Pixar have chosen, as far as I can tell, to make their first girl-POV movie begin from a starting problem of an arranged marriage tradition, and the synopsis as it stands (it&#8217;s on the io9 page) hints that they&#8217;re going with Little Mermaid-style tropes of &#8220;headstrong young woman consults wise woman for advice to avoid patriarchal problem; things go wrong&#8221;, and so on. Being critical for just a moment, I do think it would be good in the end to get to a Disney/Pixar film where female characters are not lone figures in a world of predominantly male characters, or on quests where the aim is to fight the male status quo. Or as one commenter on io9 put it, &#8220;I&#8217;m still waiting for the movie about the girl who doesn&#8217;t have to prove she&#8217;s awesome or that she&#8217;s as good as boys&#8221;. It makes me want to cheer and bounce off my chair when Merida fires that final arrow in front of all those shocked dudes, but I&#8217;d also quite like to just see her &#8230; go on a quest that isn&#8217;t about Defying Sexism. Lone Female Crusaders are all over our screens with relative frequency, from <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/03/23/at-the-movies-true-grit/"><strong>True Grit</strong>&#8216;s Mattie Ross</a> &#8211; who has a lump-throat-making scene where she packs her bags for adventure and stuffs rolls of newspaper in a man&#8217;s cowboy hat to make it fit her head &#8211; to <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/01/18/at-the-movies-the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo-oh-god-i-am-so-sorry-i-watched-the-remake-first/"><strong>The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo</strong>&#8216;s Lisbeth Salander</a> (arguably the ultimate Lone Woman On A Vengeful Spree for our time), and I&#8217;d like to see more scope for women in Hollywood stories to get to interact a bit more with <em>other women</em> &#8211; beyond, for example, &#8220;but mother, WHY can&#8217;t I do X&#8221; and &#8220;yes, sorceress, I will make this dodgy deal with you!&#8221; at the very least.</li>
<h3>BACK TO HURRAH-ING!</h3>
<li>Buuuut the fact remains that this scene still makes me go misty eyed and wibbly at the slightest provocation. I love how it looks and feels, and it&#8217;s got Billy Connolly (playing Princess Merida&#8217;s warlord dad, with whom she seems to have a pleasingly co-conspirator relationship rather than what I call the King Triton Model, though this does mean relations with mum aren&#8217;t looking cosy), Emma Thompson, Julie Walters (the wise woman conflict catalyst!) and more on board. It&#8217;s been co-authored by two women (for anyone casually interested in the gender balance of the creative team) and I&#8217;m honestly so excited (IT HAS A BEAR IN IT I LOVE BEARS I HOPE SHE DOES NOT SHOOT THE BEAR) that I&#8217;m really glad it won&#8217;t be long now.</li>
<li>ENTIRELY SPECULATION, BUT ANYWAY: On the fairy tale riffing front, I&#8217;m pleased to see such an obvious Robin Hood folklore moment referenced in the scene above &#8211; he, of course, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_v1OaC4jv1c#t=4m59s">splits an arrow just like this</a> in his own quest to win Maid Marion, and in this version the princess is out to win&#8230;her own hand. Neat. Since it was originally titled <em>The Bear and the Bow</em>, so presumably has a bear of some importance in the story, it&#8217;s also got me wondering whether it&#8217;ll draw on beast stories like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_of_the_Sun_and_West_of_the_Moon">East of the Sun, West of the Moon</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brown_Bear_of_Norway">Brown Bear of Norway</a>. The idea is that the woman goes on a journey and finds a man/foils a curse along the way. That might not happen in <strong>Brave</strong> at all, but since the opening problem is marriage-related I&#8217;d be surprised if no options around the topic came up, and if it doesn&#8217;t happen like that, that&#8217;ll be an attempt at subversion in itself. Either way, I think with the final title being <strong>Brave</strong> I&#8217;m optimistic about how it&#8217;ll turn out for Merida.</li>
<li>THERE IS A HORSE IN IT AND HIS NAME IS ANGUS. I love Disney&#8217;s horses. They&#8217;ve carved out a noble niche as providers of bathos and irony over the years from <a href="http://disney.wikia.com/wiki/Samson_(Sleeping_Beauty)">Samson</a> through to <a href="http://disney.wikia.com/wiki/Maximus">Maximus</a>. ANGUS, I HAVE HIGH HOPES FOR YOU. (Although I kind of wish you were an <a href="http://maxbarry.com/2011/07/08/news.html">Elspeth</a>, maybe? I mean, Maximus would&#8217;ve been fine as&#8230; Agrippina, you know?) Oh God, now everyone&#8217;s going to think I&#8217;m really weird. Uh. Moving on.</li>
<li>Conclusion: Any road, I think my DVD shelf can take one more Lone Female Crusader in this instance. See you in the cinema.</li>

So here I am talking about traditional Anglo-American music. Problem solved.</p>
<p>I was also inspired by a question from <a title="Twitter - Feminister" href="http://twitter.com/FeministInti">@FeministInti</a> to her twitter followers: do you know any folk songs that feature gender-based violence? The answer is yes, AND HOW. In a few moments we had amassed enough for a limited edition CD box set of traditional songs about rape, domestic violence and murdered women.</p>
<p>It tends to be these songs that a lot of modern folkish artists have picked up on. Yes, I’m looking at you Nick Cave. And you, Decemberists, although I love you. There are also a lot (a LOT) of waiflike folk girls with guitars singing about how love is like a cloud or they’re not sure which handbag matches their heart, as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S8UxfY9HtY">parodied</a> by Bill Bailey.</p>
<p>As an antidote to the murdery and misogynist on the one hand and the mindlessly insipid and pathetic on the other I thought I would take this opportunity to share and celebrate some traditional songs in which women come out on top.</p>
<p>Note: Because the songs are hundreds of years old in some cases there’s quite a lot of variety over names and lyrics. I managed to find versions of nearly all of them on Spotify and have made a collaborative playlist so y’all can add any others you find: <a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/sajarina/playlist/3HNBKRwCGTqGMVKHko3PG4">Kickass women in folk songs</a>.</p>

<p>Now THIS is what I’m talking about &#8211; songs about women dressing as sailors, hunters and highwaymen, whether to find their true love or just for kicks. Some of them sound a little unhinged: like Sovay, who is prepared to blow her lover’s head off if he gives up the love token she has given him. But the heroine in &#8216;The Golden Glove&#8217; is very endearing as she cleverly arranges matters so that she can marry the man she loves (and “enjoy” him, as she sings gleefully).</p>

<h2>Bold and crafty women</h2>
<p>The Crafty Maid and Lovely Joan outsmart their arrogant would-be seducers and make off with their horses. Sally Brown kicks the ass of the Cruel Youth, saving her own life and avenging the deaths of the ‘pretty maidens’ who went before her, and the Bonny Lass of Angelsey dances the king and 15 of his knights out of their swag.</p>

<p>The woman in Joan Baez’s version of the Silver Dagger decides not to risk getting her heart broken by keeping clear of love altogether. Whether she’s right or wrong, I like that she makes a choice.</p>

And on every link a heart does dangle<br />
Of another maid he&#8217;s loved and wronged.”</p></blockquote>

<h3>Stones on Parade.</h3>
<p>A word that may suggest stones or horses, depending on your point of view. Naturally, these senses are distinct, and <em>jade </em>is  accordingly given two separate entries in the dictionary.</p>

<p>The first refers to the stone, itself a hybrid of &#8216;two distinct minerals&#8217;, which &#8216;for their hardness have been used for implements and ornaments&#8217;. These two, Nephrite and Jadeite, originate in different languages (<em>lithos nephritikos</em> and <em>l&#8217;ejade</em> respectively), but connect at the identical meaning &#8216;kidney / colic stones&#8217;, in allusion to <em>jade</em>&#8216;s perceived medicinal properties. Famously fascinating to Chinese artists in particular, from as far back as the Shang dynasty, <em>jade </em>was also valued for its hardness and concomitant indestructibility (hence its use in burials, as in the Mayan example on the left) – much more than a simple gemstone.</p>
<h3>A Horse of a Different Colour</h3>
<p><em>Jade</em>&#8216;s lexical half-brother form is of unknown origin, though possibly connected to &#8216;yaud&#8217; via the Icelandic &#8216;jalda&#8217; (= &#8216;mare&#8217;). Its first citation appears around 1386, and here <em>jade </em>is glossed as &#8216;a contemptuous name for a horse&#8217;, or &#8216;a horse as opposed to a riding horse&#8217;. Its pejorative status may explain its feminine etymology: mares were generally used in Days Of Yore for more everyday work than that chosen for stallions and geldings, losing their rights to many of the Sexy Jobs (racing, fighting, hunting, fishin&#8217;, shootin&#8217;) because of their perceived Attitude Problems, especially during estrous.</p>
<p>I am, alas, no equine expert so I cannot claim to know how much of this derives from suspicious anthropomorphism and how much from observable truth. It sounds as dubious as similar assertions that &#8216;all&#8217; women are mardy, but if some horse-fancier out there can prove otherwise, well, I bow to your superior wisdom, and toddle back tail-drawn to the dictionary, where it is safe and warm.</p>
<h3>Bring On The Dancing Horses.</h3>
<p>More vaguely, <em>jade</em> can signify a rather delicious list of equine insults: &#8216;a roadster, a hack, a sorry inconditioned wearied or worn out horse; a vicious, worthless, ill tempered horse&#8217;, but (and the dictionary is very specific on this point), it is only &#8216;rarely&#8217; applied to a donkey. In extended meaning, it can be &#8216;generally&#8217; applied to a horse in a kind of affectionate usage &#8216;without depreciatory sense&#8217;, where its main appearance is in Renaissance comedy. Thus, in Jonson&#8217;s beautiful <em>Alchemist </em>(c.1610), the servant Face resents being made to &#8216;stalk like a mill-jade&#8217;.</p>
<p>Alas, since the decline of horses as a major method of transportation, the utility of a catch-all insult for useless specimens has come into question, and nowadays the word is rare. We are left with the slightly more familiar sense, arriving in the 1550s, as &#8216;<em>a term of reprobation applied to a woman</em>&#8216;. In this instance, it is unclear exactly what it means: its citations largely sound like tautologies, as in &#8216;an expensive jade of a wife&#8217; (from the <em>Spectator </em>in 1722), and I suppose its significance is in extending the &#8216;useless&#8217; tag of the original equine. Indeed, given the dictionary&#8217;s conservative tendencies over citations (and the early date for this last term) we can assume that these first and second uses of <em>jade </em>are feeding off each other, and probably almost synonymous.</p>
<p>However, like its original horsey meaning, <em>jade </em>as a woman can also be jocular, apparently in alignment with &#8216;<em>hussy </em>or <em>minx</em>&#8216;; and this latter may, incidentally, derive its playfulness in extension from another animal origin, <em>mynx </em>(&#8216;a puppy&#8217;) and / or the Middle Dutch <em>minnekijn</em>, meaning &#8216;darling&#8217; or &#8216;sweetheart&#8217;. We might also think of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnie_the_Minx">Minnie</a>, herself a sort of feminist icon, if you will.</p>
<h3>Oh, Man.</h3>
<p>But one of the surprising things about this surprising word is its gender neutrality: thus its third meaning, in application to a man, &#8216;usually in some figure drawing from sense 1&#8217;, that is, (here we are again) back to horse insults. This is the usage it has in <em>The Taming of The Shrew</em>, an early Shakespeare release that titularly plays with subordinating occasionally recalcitrant beasts and frequently riles audiences with its ostensibly despicable gender-politics:</p>
<blockquote><p>Petruchio: &#8230;Come, sit on me,<br />
Katherina: Asses are made to bear, and so are you.<br />
Petruchio: Women are made to bear, and so are you.<br />
Katherina: No such jade as you, if me you mean.</p>
<p>William Shakespeare, <strong>The Taming Of The Shrew</strong> (c.1590-4) II.i.198-201.</p></blockquote>
<p>The &#8216;Shrew&#8217;, Katherina, here dubs her &#8216;Tamer&#8217; a <em>jade </em>in this third sense, playing with the punning meanings of &#8216;bear&#8217; that have immediately preceded. Asses are made to bear; so are women. Oh ho. Fun with zeugmas.</p>
<p>But Katherina gives as good as she gets, Minnie-style, using <em>j</em><em>ade </em>to succinctly imply that Petruchio is the sexual equivalent of &#8216;a sorry, ill-conditioned or worn out horse&#8217; (which in asexual extension gives us <em>jaded </em>as &#8216;worn out, cynical&#8217; – probably the only form of this word still in common use). That the horse in question may have began lexical life as a &#8216;mare&#8217; seems contextually unimportant, since nowhere in the history of sexual politics is a woman expected to &#8216;keep up&#8217; or indeed do much more than &#8216;fall back&#8217;. Nonetheless, it is interesting that the male should be attacked here on explicitly sexual territory, which also draws attention to <em>jade</em>&#8216;s arguable antonyms, &#8216;stallion&#8217;, and &#8216;stud&#8217;.</p>
<p>So where does <em>jade </em>leave us now? Sometime around the 1970s, it was the first sense of the word that spawned the (unisex) name meaning &#8216;jewel&#8217; or &#8216;precious stone&#8217;, as indeed <em>jade </em>the gem now endures in everyday language. But the flip-side of this now almost obsolete word is its punning sexual suggestiveness, where it is interesting to note that this is one ostensibly female word that turns back to bite its male accusers. A jade&#8217;s trick indeed.</p>
