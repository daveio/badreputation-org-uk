					<description><![CDATA[Now that I'm no longer a chippy thirteen-year-old convinced that people with trust-funds can't make good music, I've been reassessing Elastica.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/HHlypG2kJuc?rel=0" frameborder="0" width="420" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>This post was mostly inspired by the complaint of my fellow BadRep member Sarah J that, when the subject of Elastica comes up, the band are frequently dismissed outright as flagrant copyists led by Britpop&#8217;s version of Lady Macbeth. In fairness, I spent most of the 90s thinking the same thing. God, I used to hate Elastica. Wilfully amateur slack-jawed rip-off merchants whose over-privileged frontwoman seemed to exist only as a drawly amalgam of her indie boyfriends (hair by Brett, boots by Damon), whose competency in snagging the catchiest bits of post-punk couldn’t disguise how irritatingly thick and bland they were in all other respects. Right? Right. Now that I&#8217;m no longer a chippy thirteen-year-old convinced that people with trust-funds can&#8217;t make good music, I&#8217;ve been reassessing Elastica.</p>

Image via Wikipedia, shared under Fair Use guidelines." width="220" height="79" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Elastica are a band it&#8217;s probably easier to appreciate in retrospect and in isolation from their era, especially if you weren&#8217;t actually around for it. They weren&#8217;t a great fit with Britpop, their music drawing more on the punk revivalism of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_wave_of_new_wave">New Wave of New Wave</a>, one of several burgeoning movements which Britpop left steamrollered in its wake. This 70s-rooted recycling was also ahead of its time, being more of a piece with the early-2000s bands also inspired by post-punk: like Karen O, or Jack White, Justine Frischmann now just looks like a cool-as-fuck frontperson. I mean, she <em>was</em> posh, of course. If she called her dad, not only could he stop it all but in 1989 he could also buy her a Kensington townhouse. Not that she ever tried to hide this, or to claim any kind of gritty authenticity. (Given that the British music press, and music in general, was and remains riddled with posh girls and boys, I do wonder how much of the media focus on this aspect was some kind of overdefensive deflection on their part, back in the insulting and appropriative days of poor-is-cool.)</p>
<p>Elastica&#8217;s potted biography reads like a Britpop potboiler &#8211; or, in accounts like John Harris&#8217;, <a href="http://damonalbarnunofficial.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/indie-soap-opera-justine-frischmann.html">an &#8216;indie soap opera&#8217;</a>. Frischmann founded Suede with her fellow UCL student Brett Anderson in 1989, hawking the embryonic group around Camden as their <em>de facto</em> manager before leaving both Suede and Anderson for her iconic power-coupling with chancer <em>extraordinaire</em>, Blur&#8217;s Damon Albarn. In 1992 she formed her own group with former Suede drummer Justin Welch, adding enigmatic Brightonian bassist Annie Holland (who ended up with her own <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4m5WC63BfU">theme song</a>) and south Welsh urchin Donna Matthews as Frischmann&#8217;s musical foil on guitar. In 1993 they released <strong>Stutter</strong>, a crushingly cool eyeroll of a single that, having something to do with male sexual dysfunction and something to do with female sexual frustration, was one of the most playfully frank songs I’d heard since <strong>Orgasm Addict</strong>. The next year, as Britpop was decisively yanked into the mainstream, Frischmann’s relationship with Blur&#8217;s lead singer gained her lasting notoriety in the music press and beyond as a kind of Britpop <a href="http://venturefans.org/vbwiki/Dr._Girlfriend">Dr Girlfriend</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/0ie4x8hWYYE?rel=0" frameborder="0" width="420" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>I’ll come to the fuss made over Justine’s sex life later. The <em>other</em> Thing That Everyone Knows About Elastica is that they stole all their best riffs. Well, yes, Elastica settled out of court with both Wire (<strong>Line Up</strong>, a song I&#8217;m still happy to hate, rips off the chorus of Wire&#8217;s <strong>I Am the Fly</strong>; the synth in <strong>Connection</strong> rips off the guitar in <strong>Three Girl Rhumba</strong>) and the Stranglers (<strong>Waking Up</strong> rips off <strong>No More Heroes</strong> pretty much wholesale) &#8211; but let&#8217;s think about this. Britpop itself was incredibly derivative, backwards-looking, insular and self-referential, as were its exponents. The entire exercise was a cultural and aesthetic rip-off of the late 1960s, and more particularly of the Beatles-Kinks-Jam tradition of white-boy guitar rock. Musical, lyrical and sartorial rip-offs (or &#8216;tributes&#8217;, or &#8216;homages&#8217;, or &#8216;cheeky nods to&#8217;) abounded, as indeed they do in any period and genre. In music as in any art form, it&#8217;s what one does with it that counts. I still rate <strong>Cigarettes and Alcohol</strong>, for instance, despite its massive musical debt to T-Rex&#8217;s <strong>Get It On</strong>, and despite Oasis&#8217; massive debt in general to, oh, let&#8217;s start with the Beatles, Status Quo, Slade and the Glitter Band.</p>
<p>If it were simply a case of, to misquote an unknown wit, &#8216;Your album is both good and original. But the part that is good is not original, and the part that is original is not good&#8217;, that would be one thing. But there is a reason why 1995&#8217;s <strong>Elastica</strong> became the fastest-selling debut in UK history at the time. Even in the throes of my irritation with Frischmann herself, I found the music slickly derivative, sure, but also annoyingly listenable. The songs on the debut &#8211; which it took me about three years to grudgingly buy and listen to in full &#8211; are sharp, snarky and unadorned gems strung together by that snide, campy <em>Sprechgesang</em> that was probably Justine&#8217;s best musical asset. The songs range from little flash-bangs of sex-positive brilliance (<strong>Stutter</strong>, <strong>All-Nighter</strong>, <strong>Blue</strong>, <strong>Vaseline</strong>), to vaguely sinister languor (<strong>S.O.F.T</strong>, <strong>2:1</strong>, <strong>Waking Up</strong>), to the archly anthemic (<strong>Car Song</strong>, <strong>Line Up</strong>, <strong>Connection</strong>). The album’s stripped-down, angular art-punk, its odd, listless mix of sleaze and melancholy, and the band&#8217;s Last Gang In Town fronting in photographs and on record sleeves, anticipated the revival (or the ripping-off, perhaps?) of such stylings almost a decade later by the Strokes/Libertines axis of hipster. And when thinking back to the bands who came to be regarded as luminaries towards the tail-end of Britpop &#8211; The Bluetones, Shed 7, Northern Uproar, and no doubt I&#8217;ve repressed many more &#8211; you can only wish they&#8217;d ripped off something half as interesting themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/VMXGMdqKKGQ?rel=0" frameborder="0" width="420" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>At a point in the 90s where the dominant female aesthetic revolved around ladette football shirts or twee tea-dresses, Elastica adopted an atypical New Wave uniform: black leather, drainpipe jeans, hair boyishly cropped or bobbed. For Frischmann at least, her androgynous aesthetic was a deliberate choice linked to self-consciousness, a protective effacing or subsuming of femininity which will make sense to anyone who&#8217;s tried to negotiate the disputed territory of being socially independent while aware of one&#8217;s relative vulnerability. In an interview with Simon Reynolds in 1995, Justine referred to her choice of look as &#8216;Nineties urban camouflage&#8217;, and, interestingly, associated the process of growing up with learning to step away from a conventionally feminine presentation rather than accepting it:</p>
<blockquote><p>[JF]&#8230;When you&#8217;re in your twenties you feel more confident about what you are, you don&#8217;t feel like you necessarily have to dress up for boys. When I was a teenager I had really long hair and felt like I had to wear make-up. But now I feel a lot more comfortable with short hair. It&#8217;s something I discovered with leaving home and going to college. In a way, it&#8217;s Nineties urban camoflage. It came about when I was coming back from college really late, getting on the last tube. If you&#8217;re wearing long hair and make-up, you&#8217;re gonna feel a lot more vulnerable than if you&#8217;ve got short hair and big boots&#8230;</p>
<p>[SR] So there&#8217;s a sense that you sartorially avoid the things that signify vulnerability or &#8216;availability&#8217;?</p>
<p>[JF] It&#8217;s just expecting to be treated as one of the lads. You don&#8217;t want to deliberately remove yourself from being able to be a good bloke.</p>
<p>&#8211; <a href="http://reynoldsretro.blogspot.co.uk/2007/09/elastica-interview-melody-maker-march.html">Source.</a></p></blockquote>
<p>NB I like Reynolds&#8217; idea, in this interview, of women artists in the 90s &#8216;taking on played-out male traditions, tweaking and reinventing them&#8217;, but I&#8217;m not altogether sure how helpful it is to dub it &#8216;stylistic transvestism&#8217; as he does, rather than simply problematising &#8216;feminine&#8217; identity itself. (He&#8217;s on steadier ground when he mentions Buzzcocks, who Elastica remind me of especially in songs like <strong>Stutter</strong> and <strong>All-Nighter</strong>, with Justine&#8217;s nonchalantly transgressive blurring of gender norms suggesting a southern female mirror-image of Pete Shelley, but maybe that&#8217;s just me.)</p>
<p>On &#8216;stylistic transvestism&#8217;, she seemed similarly doubtful:</p>
<blockquote><p>[SR] Drag kings rule: Polly Jean Harvey with her hoary blues-man posturings; Courtney Love as Henry Rollins if he&#8217;d only remove his &#8216;Iron Man&#8217; emotional armature and let his &#8216;feminine side&#8217; splurge&#8217;n&#8217;splatter; Liz Phair and her feminised/feminist take on the geeky garage punk of Paul Westerberg of the Replacements. And there&#8217;s Justine Frischmann, who&#8217;s somehow miraculously found imaginative space for herself in the Stranglers&#8217; gruff, fake-prole belligerence and &#8216;who wants the world?&#8217; cynicism. That said, Justine&#8217;s pretty phazed when I ask if she ever feels like she&#8217;s in drag onstage.</p>
<p>[JF] Well, I sometimes feel like Meatloaf, when I&#8217;ve got hair all over my face and I&#8217;m really sweaty. Which is a bit depressing. But no, I don&#8217;t ever feel like a woman in drag, to be honest.</p>
<p>[SR] So there&#8217;s no sense in which you play-act a tough-guy?</p>
<p>[JF] I think lots of women do that these days. And there&#8217;s always been girly girls and non-girly girls. There&#8217;s girls who have really high voices and like wearing dresses, and others who don&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m exceptional, it&#8217;s just that most of my mates haven&#8217;t been very girly. There&#8217;s lots of young women in London who look and dress like I do.</p>

<p>Even when I was forcing myself to dislike her on grounds of class chippiness, one of the things I couldn’t help liking about Justine was the casual confidence, the superiority even, in so much of her lyrics and delivery, and their emphasis on female sexual agency. <strong>All-Nighter</strong> is, like <strong>Stutter</strong>, a self-assured and playful song about sexual frustration, and there&#8217;s an archly objective approach to sex in <strong>Car Song</strong> and <strong>Vaseline</strong> and many more. There&#8217;s &#8216;just&#8217; sex in these songs &#8211; little sentiment and less romance &#8211; but equally there&#8217;s little angst, no judgement and no self-reproach. <strong>Never Here</strong> is a heartfelt, simple and incisive anatomy of a defunct relationship, just as well-crafted and moving as, say, Blur’s <strong>Tender</strong>, but terse and economic where the latter is overblown. Frischmann&#8217;s protagonists are thinly drawn but invariably assertive and self-possessed, frustrated or impatient with their hapless, thoughtless or less self-assured partners, sure of what they want and feeling no guilt about taking it. They never make a point of being Bad Girls, they just happen to be girls.</p>
<p>Like her fellow Stranglers aficionado <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/11/30/gaye-advert-and-the-great-cock-n-balls-swindle/">Gaye Advert</a> twenty years previously, Frischmann&#8217;s drop-dead charisma got in the way of her stated intention to be &#8216;one of the lads&#8217;. Her sexually confident persona and Elastica&#8217;s pleasure-centred, borderline-selfish lyrics, despite their matter-of-fact delivery, tended to be treated as &#8216;naughtily&#8217; deviant departures from feminine convention rather than just another way in which women might happen to view themselves and their sex lives. That the music press and wider media insistently framed Justine in relation to the men she chose to sleep with was part of a wider sexualisation where, in the post-Britpop 90s, female sexual agency had increasingly to be presented within a Lad frame of reference. I remember, specifically, there being a weird concentration by the music press on whether she would or wouldn&#8217;t pose for <strong>Playboy</strong>. It&#8217;s tempting to conclude that Frischmann&#8217;s ostensibly aloof and independent approach, her chilled assertiveness, her androgyny, and perhaps her background, attracted a reductive emphasis on her sexuality and sex life as a way of rendering her comprehensible, less of a threat and more of a &#8216;regular&#8217; girl.</p>
<p>Women weren&#8217;t absent from 90s indie, but <a href="http://upclosemaspersonal.blogspot.com/2012/03/lost-girls.html">as I&#8217;ve written elsewhere</a>, there is a sense in which they were squeezed to the margins by the elevation of &#8216;lad bands&#8217;, the testosterone-heavy dominance (with some honourable and dishonourable exceptions) of the music press and mens&#8217; magazines, and the focus on male key players and kingmakers, from Anderson, Albarn and the Gallaghers to Alan McGee. The received wisdom of Britpop as a male concern and male preserve obscures how highly-rated Elastica were at the time &#8211; notably, they came closer than either Oasis or Blur to cracking the lucrative US market &#8211; and it also overlooks the contribution made by Frischmann to Britpop&#8217;s originating impulse. Love or hate it, Frischmann&#8217;s influence on and creative partnerships with (or, if we&#8217;re going with the Lady Macbeth angle, her bewitching and manipulation of) Britpop&#8217;s main men was instrumental to the movement but goes more or less unsung. Instead she now gets frequently relegated to a minor player, an accessory or at best a &#8216;muse&#8217; to the more famous and credible men in her life, and her band are remembered as, in Sarah J&#8217;s words, a &#8216;Blurgirlfriend novelty act&#8217;. Her break-up with Albarn in 1997 was partly the result of a reluctance to accept what she perceived as the restrictions of domesticity and motherhood:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Damon was saying to me, &#8216;You&#8217;ve given me a run for my money, you&#8217;ve proved that you&#8217;re just as good as I am, you&#8217;ve had a hit in America &#8211; now settle down and let&#8217;s have kids.&#8217; He wanted me to stop being in a group, stop touring and have children. I wasn&#8217;t very happy, and he kept saying, &#8216;The reason you&#8217;re unhappy is because you really want children but you don&#8217;t know it.&#8217; It did throw me: I thought about it quite seriously.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="http://damonalbarnunofficial.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/indie-soap-opera-justine-frischmann.html">Source.</a></p></blockquote>

Image via wikipedia, shared under fair use guidelines." width="278" height="192" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>After 1996 Elastica were gradually subsumed by smack, angst and inter-band acrimony, with an endless parade of members leaving, being replaced and returning. Their second album, 2000&#8217;s <strong>The Menace</strong>, was more firmly anchored in post-punk experimentalism, but lacklustre, anticlimactic and accordingly less than commercial &#8211; although I had by this point got over myself enough to admit that I liked it, an epiphany which I&#8217;m sure was a source of extraordinary comfort for the band, who announced their amicable break-up the following year. Since then, Frischmann has been a bit of a Renaissance woman: collaborating with M.I.A. on songs including 2003&#8217;s <strong>Galang</strong>; moving to Colorado to study visual arts and psychology; dipping into abstract painting; and, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOlnQfTKoU4">as shown here</a>, fronting a BBC series on modern architecture.</p>
<p>Justine Frischmann&#8217;s rise against a Britpop backdrop, and her subsequent infamy or dismissal, raises several issues relevant to feminism: the denial or marginalizing of women&#8217;s contributions to artistic and creative moments; the relegation of women to the accessory of whichever man they happen to have slept with; the idea that women in bands are automatically amateur or derivative, or just not as good at being amateur and derivative as the boys are. However short-lived Elastica&#8217;s fame and drawn-out their dissipated demise, their career remains more edifying than watching the Oasis juggernaut run slowly and embarrassingly out of steam, or indeed whatever Alex James is currently up to.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[This June just gone, I’ve been having fun on a variety of games...]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This June just gone, I’ve been having fun on a variety of games &#8211; but that also means I haven’t finished any of them just yet.  Plus I’ve only had three weeks of the month to play before writing this as I’m moving home, so I expect some disruption.  Nevertheless, I can finally bring you comments on <strong>Assassin’s Creed: Revelations</strong> <em>(over 6 months after release &#8211; soz),</em> alongside <strong>Bastion</strong> from the <strong>Humble Bundle V</strong>, which, by the way, ended up with over $5,000,000 raised.  Also: <strong>Torchlight</strong> and some watching-over-my-partner’s-shoulder of <strong>Max Payne 3</strong> (for PC).</p>
<p>I’ve also had a bit of a <a href="http://www.tf2.com/"><strong>TF2</strong></a> revival this month, and that’s been fun, but what more can be said about TF2?  There are no female characters (yet), although there are plenty of female gamers.  I personally haven’t seen much SexistFail in chat but I know it does happen on some servers (you do, however, get a <em>lot</em> of childish insults and obscene ‘sprays’ on some servers).  It’s a fun, team-based game that’s F2P (Free2Play), and <strong>Valve</strong> just <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-18456171">hired an economist</a> to help with the ever expanding Mannconomy and the inter-game economies as they grow further still.  That’s interesting, right?  Plus <a title="Team Fortress: Pyromania" href="www.teamfortress.com/pyromania" target="_blank">PYROMANIA</a> has landed.</p>
<div id="attachment_11402" style="width: 264px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/120430_bastion.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11402" data-attachment-id="11402" data-permalink="/2012/07/12/gamer-diary-what-ive-been-playing-june-2012/120430_bastion/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/120430_bastion.jpg?fit=530%2C350&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="530,350" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Bastion" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/120430_bastion.jpg?fit=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/120430_bastion.jpg?fit=530%2C350&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11402 " title="Bastion" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/120430_bastion.jpg?resize=254%2C168" alt="Screengrab of The Kid from Bastion - small and wide-eyed with white-blond hair." width="254" height="168" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/120430_bastion.jpg?w=530&amp;ssl=1 530w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/120430_bastion.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 254px) 100vw, 254px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-11402" class="wp-caption-text">Bastion&#8217;s protag, &#8220;the Kid&#8221;, looking a bit moody.</p></div>
<p>To <a href="http://supergiantgames.com/?page_id=242"><strong>Bastion</strong></a>!  This is a very curious indie title that offers a considerable amount of play-time compared to other indie offerings.  It&#8217;s described as “<em>…an action role-playing experience that redefines storytelling in games, with a reactive narrator who marks your every move</em>”.  I’ve heard similar claims before and ended up disappointed, but <strong>Bastion</strong> really delivers on this concept.  Admittedly, the narrator’s voice does get on my nerves but it really does react to what you do.  I’m sure there’s an inventory of quips and comments that are selected according to specific trigger events in the game but it’s still pretty cool.</p>
<p>The art is lovely and it isn’t just the simple damsel-in-distress format that I have encountered in a lot of other indie titles (<strong>LIMBO</strong>, <strong>Braid</strong>, for example), which is a nice change of pace.  Although the main active characters are all male and the one female (so far) has been pretty passive, there’s still a good bit of joy to be taken from this game.  It’s simple enough to grasp and you can make it harder in a variety of ways, so for gameplay and originality it gets a thumbs-up from me.  Unfortunately, if you didn’t get lucky and snap up the Humble Bundle, <strong>Bastion</strong> as a standalone is <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/107100/">£11.49 on <strong>Steam</strong></a> but is currently going for under £9 on <a href="http://www.greenmangaming.com/s/gb/en/pc/games/rpgs/bastion/"><strong>Green Man Gaming</strong></a> (sort of an alternative to Steam).</p>
<p>The one last thing that I will mention about <strong>Bastion</strong> is the soundtrack, which is beautiful, and I bring this up because I also want to make a special note of <strong>Torchlight</strong>’s soundtrack.  While playing <strong>Torchlight</strong> I am constantly finding myself with the urge to go and watch <strong>Sunshine</strong> again.  This is because the generic background twinkling of <strong>Torchlight</strong> often hits some of the same chords or sequences that the piece <a href="http://youtu.be/NQXVzg2PiZw">‘Sunshine (Adagio in D Minor)’</a> features.  Now, that piece (composed by John Murphy) makes me all soft and wibbly on the inside every time I hear it.  As does watching <strong>Sunshine</strong>.  But, alas, ’tis presently packed in a box somewhere.</p>

<p>Music aside, <strong>Torchlight</strong> (yes, it’s 3 years old, sorry!) is a great little RPG offering.  I have it because I pre-ordered <a href="http://www.torchlight2game.com/"><strong>Torchlight II</strong></a> via Steam and got <strong>Torchlight</strong> to play with in the meantime.  <strong>Torchlight II</strong> is making some people in RPG land a bit excited after the numerous issues people have had with <strong>Diablo III</strong>.  The first game is charming, easy to use and offers some features bigger RPGs haven’t, such as sending your pet to town to sell items from your backpack – meaning you’ll end up with a huge surplus of Town Portal Scrolls as you never need to use them!  It does, regrettably, fall foul of the tediously standard female-armour-fail… <em>do all these women seriously have bullet/arrow/sword/magic proof tits and navels?</em>  That’s the only negative so far, but this looks like it might be halfway rectified, at least, in <strong>Torchlight II</strong>: go and check out the <a href="http://www.torchlight2game.com/classes">character classes</a> on their site <em>(only one of the 4 female figures has cleavage showing!)</em>.</p>
<p>Now for something released in 2012; I know, incredible, right? <strong> Max Payne 3</strong> has amazing visuals, even on low-spec PCs, and great mechanisms for exciting gameplay.  It showcases the new <strong>Rockstar</strong> engine that will be used in next year’s <strong>Grand Theft Auto V</strong>; not a franchise I’m fond of, but with this engine, it&#8217;ll look stunning and run spectacularly.  <strong>Max Payne 3</strong> has kept fairly faithful to the originals and the basic ‘essence’ of Max, which is a relief for the old fans, but offers plenty for those new to the series.</p>

<p>As an <em>observer </em>(not the sinister <strong>Fringe</strong> kind) to <strong>Max Payne</strong> it’s a little different to discuss than if I&#8217;d been the <em>player</em>.  I was hoping to get my partner to contribute something here, but the house-moving saga has put paid to that plan.  <strong>Max Payne</strong> does play with some damsel-in-distress themes and always has, but it also manages to twist them around.  Originally, Max becomes an avenging angel, fallen-from-grace figure after his wife and infant daughter are murdered.  He tears up NYC seeking revenge, but finds conspiracies abound, and then his moral compass takes over and he kills all the baddies.</p>
<p>In <strong>MP3</strong>, he’s given up being a cop and is playing the private security game.  Although the game starts out with the feel that Max is off saving, and I quote, “fallen women” all over again, it swiftly changes tack in the brutal underworld of Brazil and Max, in the middle of an identity crisis, isn’t sure whether he’s a good guy, a bad guy, or a magical pixie putting the world to rights.  I’m not sure if he ever really ‘finds himself’, but he shoots all the baddies and conquers another conspiracy in typical grim, noir style.  The combat mechanics set this game apart and offer a truly varied way of kickin’ ass.  As, I say, the graphics are gorgeous, the engine is shiny and the music is atmospheric (not to mention nostalgic) the whole way through.</p>

<p>Here I am, talking so much about music and mechanics, you thought I’d forgotten <strong>AC:Rev</strong>, didn’t you?  Well, let me squeeze it in now.  I have yet to complete the game because I&#8217;ve been purposefully dawdling in order to enjoy sandboxing in such a magnificent environment.  Constantinople looks great, and you get to train up your Assassins right from the get-go, as well as the usual bits and pieces around the city with added stalkers who occasionally try to stab you right when you’re supposed to be tailing someone.  The main storyline, so far, hasn’t been too riveting, which is a shame.  I’m sure &#8211; after I’ve finished unpacking &#8211; that I’ll charge through the story and update you all next month.</p>
<p>What else can you expect in July’s end-of-month post?  I’ve got a couple of new games to play with (actually new, i.e. newly released!) and I’m always keeping an eye out for things to play, but summer tends to be time for the blockbuster films until autumn brings gaming back into focus again&#8230;</p>

<p>This is just a quick little post inspired by my recent visit to the Belle &amp; Sebastian merchandise website. I was all ready to buy a charming new <a href="http://www.belleandsebastianshop.com/product/ladies_fox_in_the_snow_t-shirt/">twee-shirt</a> when I noticed that in this little corner of planet indiepop a UK size 12 apparently constitutes &#8216;extra large&#8217;. I have no photographic record of the face I made, but here&#8217;s a <a href="http://images.cheezburger.com/completestore/2010/10/6/d04c0380-60f3-4dc1-8775-a0c38781d281.jpg">rough approximation</a>.</p>
<p>This <a href="http://www.fashion.arts.ac.uk/research/projects-collaborations/size-uk/">survey</a> from 2004 places the UK average dress size for women at size 14. And yet a 12 is not just &#8216;large&#8217; but &#8216;extra large&#8217;&#8230; something here doesn&#8217;t add up. I know the band probably have nothing to do with their merch, but I still felt disappointed. Aren&#8217;t we all shy indie outsiders together? Or are girls with curves not allowed to join the hairclip brigade?</p>
<p>I shouldn&#8217;t have been surprised, of course &#8211; every scene has its spoken or unspoken rules and standards, and just because they&#8217;re &#8216;alternative&#8217; in some ways doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re not deeply conventional in others. Besides, &#8216;indie = skinny&#8217; is well established. Here&#8217;s a nice comment on the Stereogum 2007 awards for &#8216;Ms Indie Rock Hotties&#8217; from the <a href="http://idolator.com/333090/the-ideal-indie-rock-woman-pale-malnourished-and-with-really-bad-bangs">Idolator</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>once again the winners&#8230; prove that when it comes to wank-mining material, your average indie-rocking male is looking for (gasp!) a skinny white girl with a shaggy haircut. Emphasis on the “skinny.” And did we mention the “white”? Aside from a few notable tokens exceptions, there are enough pointy elbows and too-sad-to-leave-the-house complexions here to fill up a year’s worth of American Apparel advertisements. Way to reject mainstream standards of beauty, dudes! The guy hotties list also features many downy, bony gents, yet somehow offers a slightly wider range of body types than the chick list’s parade of waifs.</p></blockquote>
<p>It also reminded me of a <a href="http://pennyred.blogspot.com/2010/01/pretty-vacant-self-objectification-and.html">post</a> by Laurie Penny from a couple of years back, about the prevalence and acceptance of self-objectification in alternative subcultures. As she says, “there is an assumption that misogyny and beauty fascism don&#8217;t count outside of the mainstream, that they don&#8217;t hurt.” Penny also points out that the notion that getting your kit off is empowering for women is as readily accepted as it is in mainstream pop culture: “the idea being that because the young women with no clothes on aren&#8217;t necessarily blonde and permatanned, it&#8217;s all fine and dandy and edgy and exciting.”</p>
<p>This stuff can still hurt, perhaps even more when it&#8217;s under the banner of quirky individualism; be as eccentric as you like, as long as you&#8217;re thin and sexy while you do it. EJ Dickson did a great <a href="http://www.nerve.com/entertainment/zooey-deshanel">post</a> for Nerve about how the message to &#8216;be yourself&#8217;, so beloved of all kinds of alternative subcultures, can actually contain coded pressures to look and act a particular way when you are being dripfed an ideal, in this case Zooey Deschanel.</p>
<blockquote><p>Would Zooey Deschanel have sex after eating a bucket of chicken wings?, I often wondered. Would she be self-conscious about the way her stomach looked while she was on top? The answers to these questions, of course, was invariably no, she would not: Zooey Deschanel would be thin and awesome during sex, and after she blew the guy&#8217;s mind she&#8217;d take out her ukulele and write a song about it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dickson is honest about the damage she did to her relationships with others in pursuit of the version of herself she felt she ought to be. People will always want to be attractive, whatever that means to them. But it feels like a lot of goths and punks and indie kids are missing the point if we just swap one set of impossible beauty standards for another.</p>
<p>Not for the first time I find myself wishing I&#8217;d had something like <a href="http://www.mookychick.co.uk/">Mookychick</a> when I was a teenager. Alongside tutorials on applying neon eyeshadow they have features about health, self esteem, and a whole section on alternative <a href="http://www.mookychick.co.uk/alternative-fashion/plus-size-clothing/">plus size fashion</a> including stockists.</p>
<p>In case it&#8217;s useful for anyone out there struggling with body image issues and self esteem (and I think everyone does sometimes, surely), one thing I&#8217;ve found that helps me chillax and stop thinking about it is remembering that no one is studying me as hard as I&#8217;m studying myself. Most people won&#8217;t even notice whatever it is that&#8217;s bothering you, not least because they&#8217;re too wrapped up in their own lives and their body worries to care if your pores look big or your hips are cellulicious.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not easy, and I certainly haven&#8217;t cracked it, but one of the most radical choices you can make is to give up thinking you&#8217;re ugly.</p>
