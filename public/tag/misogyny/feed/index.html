										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello my darlings!  This month I&#8217;m back to my mid-month gaming post (as last month I wandered into the<a title="Silent Witness s15: ‘Calm down, dear…’" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/05/28/silent-witness-s15-calm-down-dear/" target="_blank"> realms of TV</a>) and I&#8217;ll be presenting to you the Humble Bundle V, after which we&#8217;ll be taking a bit of a negative turn&#8230; you will see.  Potential <em>trigger warning</em>, mind you, of the Epic Rage descent.</p>
<h3>Humble Bundle V</h3>
<p>The <strong><a title="The Humble Bundle" href="http://www.humblebundle.com" target="_blank">Humble Bundle</a></strong> is a nice little concept: a collection of indie titles for you to pay what you want for and then decide how much of that fee goes to a) the developers, b) Humble Bundle themselves, or c) charity.</p>
<p>I got it on the first day (and, sorry, but by the time this post goes live I suspect the window will have closed) so I only got the first five games that were included.  Since then there&#8217;ve been three more titles added if you paid over the average.  These were added in light of this bundle making over <a title="PC Gamer: Humble Indie Bundle makes $1.8m in first 15 hours" href="http://www.pcgamer.com/2012/06/01/humble-indie-bundle-5-makes-1-8-million-in-15-hours/?ns_campaign=article-feed&amp;ns_mchannel=ref&amp;ns_source=steam&amp;ns_linkname=0&amp;ns_fee=0" target="_blank">$1.8 million in the first 15 hours</a>.</p>
<p>Included in the Bundle were:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Psychonauts</strong></li>
<li><strong>Amnesia: The Dark Descent</strong></li>
<li><strong>LIMBO</strong></li>
<li><strong>Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sorcery EP</strong></li>
<li><strong>Bastion</strong>*</li>
<li><strong>Braid</strong>*+</li>
<li><strong>Lone Survivor</strong>*+</li>
<li><strong>Super Meat Boy</strong>*+</li>
</ul>
<p><em>* denotes games that were unlocked if you paid over the average; + denotes those titles added at a later stage.</em></p>
<p>Like I say, I only got the first five, but I&#8217;m not too sore as I already have <strong>Braid</strong> (not a big fan) and I&#8217;m not overly interested in the other two.  I&#8217;m not going to discuss the games themselves here because that&#8217;ll be coming in a &#8220;Playing&#8230;&#8221; post later on.</p>
<p>I thought it would be nice show you that sometimes, somewhere out there, someone does something good.  A lot of money has been raised for charity through this: not least through Big Names of Gaming competing to be the top contributors (<em>Notch</em> and <em>HumbleBrony Bundle</em> have been vying for the top spot: when I bought the bundle they were dueling around the $3000 mark, now they&#8217;re on $12,345.67 and £11,111.11 respectively).</p>

<p>Of course, as the popularity of indie games continues to rise, it&#8217;s nice to be able to have the choice to decide how much of your cash goes to the developers as opposed to not really knowing for sure how much just gets kept by various third parties.</p>
<h3>Sigh, Misogyny</h3>
<p>From that nice little snippet of camaraderie, I regret that I must now depress the tone somewhat and talk about InternetFail, and more specifically, how it&#8217;s been discussed recently with regard to the world of gaming.</p>
<p>At the start of June <strong>BBC News Magazine</strong> ran an article highlighting the constant, abhorrent abuse that female gamers get in online play: <a title="BBC News Magazine: Sexual harrasment in the world of video games" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-18280000" target="_blank">here</a>.  It mostly focusses on the experiences of one Wisconsin gamer called Jenny, of the<strong> CoD</strong> ilk, and the abuse she gets daily on voice chats.  She records them and uploads them to her website, <strong><a title="Not in the Kitchen Anymore" href="http://www.notinthekitchenanymore.com/" target="_blank">Not in the Kitchen Anymore</a></strong>, and I gotta say, she handles this shit pretty well but the point is she<em> shouldn&#8217;t have to</em>.  Especially, as the article points out, 42% of US gamers are women, and adult women outnumber teenage boys quite considerably.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a <a title="BBC World Service: Assignment: Guns, Girls and Games" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00s9jly" target="_blank">BBC World Service programme</a> based on her experiences and those of other female gamers.  If you read the article or listen to the programme you might hear some charming young fellows claiming<em> &#8220;freedom of speech&#8221;</em>, but here&#8217;s a point of interest for any such time someone tries to use this smokescreen of an excuse if you call them out as misogynists (or racists, homophobes, etc&#8230; the list, depressingly, goes on).  In both American and European (incl. British) law the &#8220;freedom of speech&#8221; excuse doesn&#8217;t fly.</p>
<p>Why&#8217;s that?  Well, if you actually read the laws you&#8217;ll see there are exclusions to what the precious First Amendment protects: <a title="Wikipedia: Freedom of Speech in the USA - Categorical Exclusions" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech_in_the_United_States#Categorical_exclusions" target="_blank">look here</a>.  What&#8217;s that?  Obscenity?  Threats?  Defamation?  Intentional infliction of emotional distress?  They&#8217;re <em>all</em> excluded from protection by the First Amendment?  OHGAWDNO!  It&#8217;s like living in a world where people treat each other with respect!  How horrible.</p>
<p>And, Euro law?  <em>Just for starters</em> you can consult <a title="Wikipedia: Article 10 of the ECHR" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_10_of_the_European_Convention_on_Human_Rights" target="_blank">Article 10</a> and <a title="Wikipedia: Article 14 of the ECHR" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights#Article_14_-_discrimination" target="_blank">Article 14</a> of the European Convention of Human Rights.  Yeah.  <strong><em>Human rights</em></strong>.  But be careful out there: trying to educate these fools in the error of their ways <strong>and</strong> the legal flaws in their defence might offend them.  The fact you&#8217;ve done some learnings <em>(that aren&#8217;t centred around how to make tasty lunchtime treats)</em> is clearly a work of pure evil!</p>
<p>Although Jenny of Wisconsin might be able to deal with it, there are a lot of people out there who can&#8217;t or don&#8217;t want to.  It takes a lot of effort, seriously.  I&#8217;m an antisocial gamer &#8211; we know this &#8211; I like playing games on my own, I hate chat and I hate voice-chats even more.  I don&#8217;t want to listen to somebody&#8217;s inane drivel while I shoot stuff, regardless of the content.  I ditched the <a title="[Gamer Diary] The Case of the MMOs – Boisterous Behaviour Abounds!" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/08/16/gamer-diary-the-case-of-the-mmos-boisterous-behaviour-abounds/" target="_blank">one MMO I played</a> a long time ago because of the racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic crap that occurred on a daily basis.  Not directed at me, just <em>there</em> &#8211; and no one really ever objected (if you did, you got the abuse turned on you).</p>
<p>My solution is not one that everyone can adopt.  I just avoid the social elements, even if it&#8217;s online team-based play like <strong>TF2</strong>, and I refuse to disclose any information about myself.  Generally, I am the wallpaper: I keep quiet and ignore chat.  This is mostly because I&#8217;m a misanthrope and do not care for being social, but partly it&#8217;s also because I know that a lot of people on chat are going to be dicks.  I just don&#8217;t understand why banter has to be offensive, even if it doesn&#8217;t go near questions of gender.</p>

<p>But back to the specific point of misogyny in the gamingverse.  I mentioned the KickStarter from <strong>Feminist Frequency</strong> in May&#8217;s &#8220;<a title="[Gamer Diary] – What I’ve Been Playing… May 2012" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/06/08/gamer-diary-what-ive-been-playing-may-2012/" target="_blank">Playing&#8230;</a>&#8221; post and the woman behind it, Anita Sarkeesian, has been yet another figurehead victim of abuse.  She put her head over that parapet, so to speak, and has had it all but <a title="New Statesman: Dear Internet, this is why you can't have nice things" href="http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/internet/2012/06/dear-internet-why-you-cant-have-anything-nice" target="_blank">shot to smithereens</a>.  Gladly, however, this isn&#8217;t going to stop her making those videos, nor <a title="KickStarter: Tropes vs women in video games" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/566429325/tropes-vs-women-in-video-games" target="_blank">has it stopped people pledging</a> (when I last checked, she was on $87,000+ with 68 hours left to go).  But this sort of thing does make me want to adopt a superhero persona, fly all over the world, and stand in defence of these women.</p>
<p>I was going to say &#8220;brave women&#8221; just ther, but that, to me, gives too much credit to these scum-sucking parasites of the internet.  It shouldn&#8217;t have to be brave just to identify as female and like games.  <strong>FFS</strong>.</p>
<p>At least &#8211; if we&#8217;re to take anything positive away from this &#8211; this all-too-common abuse is being given more and more of a public face.  A site that BBC article mentions is <strong><a title="Fat, Ugly or Slutty" href="http://fatuglyorslutty.com/" target="_blank">Fat,  Ugly or Slutty</a></strong><em> (because that&#8217;s pretty much all you are if you&#8217;re a female gamer, apparently)</em> where you can upload screengrabs of sexist abuse/harrasment.  So, if you can catch the abuse you receive, or see, in a screen grab or a recording, make it known!</p>

</ul>
<h3>The Plot Sickens</h3>
<p>To focus on misogyny is to obscure <strong>American Psycho</strong>’s scope, to ignore that the book is an uncompromising, unapologetic vortex of misanthropy and nihilism. Its narrator expresses disgust, contempt, anxiety and fear towards women, gay people, art students, Jewish people, the non-WASP, the homeless, the poor – anyone, in fact, who differs even by a small degree (a marginally more impressive business card, a better restaurant table) from the ideal which Bateman forces himself to emulate and sustain. Men in the novel are portrayed as unsympathetically as women, and dispatched as dispassionately – so why is it the torture and death of women that seems to abide with the reader?</p>

<p>Like all satire, the book exaggerates and burlesques that which already exists. The book’s scenes of torture and murder were, apparently, all based on Ellis’ reading of real life cases and criminology textbooks, not whimsically called into being by him. So <strong>American Psycho</strong> on one level is an uncensored, unsanitised exposé of what has already been done to women without any incitement or instruction from its author. Neither does Ellis’ writing give the impression that violence against women is in any way attractive. The impression it does give, to me at least, is that violence against women is horrifying, viscerally disgusting, and the preserve of fucked-up, nightmarish individuals who are increasingly prevalent during a stage of socio-economic development which encourages selfishness and greed over empathy, and whose actions are increasingly ignored or disbelieved within the same environment. His work is a mirror, not a manifesto or an instruction manual. To posit it as something qualitatively worse either than crimes actually committed against women throughout history, or to the presentation of sexualised violence or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_killer#In_media_and_popular_culture">serial killing </a>in almost any other area of the entertainment world, seems dubious.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting too how the deaths of Bateman’s victims are affected by their socio-economic background. Having decided against the murder of his date Patricia – a minor character so boringly materialistic that I’m fully on board with the theory that takes her to be Patrick’s imaginary female persona – Bateman reflects on whether it’s ‘her family’s wealth [that] protects her tonight’. In contrast, the vagrants and call girls he kills are already economic casualties, considered disposable even before they become casualties of violence. No character from society&#8217;s lower strata appears to be missed; it is only Paul Owen, Patrick&#8217;s peer and rival, whose disappearance is considered deserving enough to warrant a police investigation. The crude and blatant contrast between Bateman’s lifestyle and that of his victims – their disparity in wealth, and therefore in power, is explicitly fetishized in more than one encounter – which calls attention to the issue of why the victims of such killers are so often sex workers, or homeless, or transient, both male and female:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Within police culture&#8230; we know that if a prostitute goes missing and is reported as missing, that they won&#8217;t be given the same priority as other people would get&#8230; [sex workers are not] valued enough in our culture for the police to take it seriously.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8211; <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2010/dec/22/world-violence-sex-workers">David Wilson, Howard League for Penal Reform</a></p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; again intertwining a socio-economic indictment with a proto-feminist impulse.</p>

<p>One could argue incessantly about whether the book itself is misogynistic, or edifying, or indeed readable, but a<br />
<a href="http://www.socialjusticeleague.net/2011/09/how-to-be-a-fan-of-problematic-things/">more productive debate</a> centres on whether one can like art that one also acknowledges as problematic. When reading Anwyn Crawford’s excellent <a href="http://njmcgee.tumblr.com/post/282550705/anwyn-crawford-makes-an-impressive-attack-on-nick">critique</a> of the treatment of women in the lyrics and prose of that other aging <em>enfant terrible</em>, Nick Cave, I wasn’t convinced by all of her analysis – Cave&#8217;s work at least in its earlier phases seems, like Ellis, preoccupied with morbidly examining a pathologised masculinity rather than valorising it – but the most substantial point I drew from the ensuing debate was that the issue may be less such works themselves and more their involvement in the mainstreaming, acceptance and excusing of problematic attitudes. The gynophobic aspects of these works are made respectable by being cloaked as edgy or transgressive, when they merely dramatise the violence and inequality that already exists. Although I still contend that the violence in Ellis’ writing is not there as intentional titillation, as long as there are those for whom such things are lived experience, rather than escapist fantasy or performance material, then there will be a correspondingly visceral response to their artistic portrayal.</p>
<p>Although readers who read for prurient or puerile pleasure are hardly something for which writers can bargain or legislate, questions can be asked about the <em>cachet</em> Ellis manages to retain in the world of <strong>Guardian</strong> profiles and Soho salons, when other works of equally politicised and equally slapstick splatterpunk – Dennis Cooper, say, or Stewart Home, or even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCUM_Manifesto"><strong>The SCUM Manifesto</strong></a> – languish in the ‘cult fiction’ gutter. Helen Zahavi&#8217;s brilliant <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_Weekend_(novel)"><strong>Dirty Weekend</strong></a>, a novel published the same year as <strong>American Psycho</strong>, explores similar themes but blurs the lines between victim and perpetrator. There are marked stylistic differences, sure – Zahavi uses lyrical prose to distance or distract the reader from the trauma and gore she describes, whereas Ellis more or less rubs the reader’s face in it – and the violence of Zahavi’s protagonist is entirely reactive: she wishes only to be left alone and when she is not, she strikes out and strikes upwards. <strong>Dirty Weekend</strong>, despite receiving polarised reviews on publication, has had nothing like the long-term vilification heaped upon <strong>American Psycho</strong>, but by the same token has received far less enduring acclaim or even attention.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s just Ellis’ pre-existing status as <em>wunderkind</em> author of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Less_Than_Zero_(novel)"><strong>Less Than Zero</strong></a> that elevates his subsequent work. Or it might be the very obviousness of his traditionalist politics &#8211; <strong>American Psycho</strong> has more than a bit in common with something like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_exit_to_brooklyn"><strong>Last Exit to Brooklyn</strong></a>, a cult novel of 1964 which also enlists depictions of depravity and sexual violence in the service of what can look an awful lot like proscriptive neo-puritanism. Is there more mainstream space for works which reproduce existing social structures and power relations, which, even if they challenge their existence, do so through the evidently ambiguous strategies of grotesque exaggeration or <em>reductio ad ridiculum </em>rather than direct disruption? For all its horrified laughter at the state we’re in, <strong>American Psycho</strong> isn’t in the business of imagining alternatives to it.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[American Psycho is a house built with the tools of the master: it is, just like 80s capitalism, crass, lurid, vulgar, heavy-handed and unapologetic.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The last time I wrote that <a href="http://velvetcoalmine.wordpress.com/2011/05/26/on-liking-american-psycho/">yes, I did like <strong>American Psycho</strong></a>, and no, that wasn&#8217;t because I&#8217;d only seen the film, I was pleasantly surprised to hear that other women felt similarly, but I’m aware that we’re still a minority. <strong>American Psycho</strong> proved controversial even before its release in 1991, its unedited manuscript pushed from publisher to publisher, leaked extracts from it incurring public outrage, and its eventual appearance leapt upon by critics with the single-minded speed of a rat up a Habitrail tube. In terms of people judging the book without having read it, not a great deal seems to have changed. I don&#8217;t really expect to alter anyone&#8217;s opinion with this post, and it isn&#8217;t really even a recommendation &#8211; it&#8217;s just an exploration of why I don&#8217;t regard <strong>American Psycho</strong> as the worst book ever written.</p>
<div id="attachment_10933" style="width: 266px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/AmericanPsychoBook.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10933" data-attachment-id="10933" data-permalink="/2012/05/14/rhian-e-jones-on-liking-american-psycho-slight-return-part-12/americanpsychobook/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/AmericanPsychoBook.jpg?fit=256%2C392&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="256,392" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="AmericanPsychoBook" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/AmericanPsychoBook.jpg?fit=195%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/AmericanPsychoBook.jpg?fit=256%2C392&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-10933 " alt="Cover for the UK first edition of American Psycho.

<p>I read the book as a deeply moral – disappointingly puritan, if you like – anti-capitalist and even vaguely feminist tract. <strong>American Psycho</strong> is a house built with the tools of the master: it is, just like 1980s capitalism, crass, lurid, vulgar, heavy-handed and unapologetic. It bludgeons home its basic homily, that consumerism fails to make us happy or to lend meaning to our lives, with all the subtle and delicate artistry of a Reagan speech. But beyond this, in 2012 it’s undeniable that the values and trends the book castigated two decades back have only become more deeply entrenched. Does the book’s earnest, and still depressingly relevant, indictment of capitalism and consumerism excuse its scenes of rape, torture and murder? Maybe not, but I think those who criticise the book on these grounds, like those who called for its suppression and boycott twenty years ago, end up alienating a potential if problematic ally.</p>
<h3>Nightmares on Wall Street</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to take seriously much that Ellis says, about either this book in particular or his work in general. A lot of his public pronouncements deal in Dylanesque obfuscation, or deliberate outrage-baiting – his Twitter account alone is a masterclass in trolling – which makes it both absurd and unfortunate that his work is so often perceived as deadly serious and condemned on the same grounds. His explanations of the origins of <strong>American Psycho</strong>, though, have the ring of sincerity, and place the book in opposition to the impact of 1980s society and culture on the individual male:</p>
<blockquote><p>‘the book is, need I even say this, a criticism of a certain kind of masculinity and a certain kind of white male, heterosexual, capitalist, yuppie scumbag behavior.’</p>
<p>– <a href="http://www.punkglobe.com/breteastonellisinterview0411.php">Bret Easton Ellis, 2011 </a></p>
<p>‘Whenever I am asked to talk American Psycho, I have to remember why I was writing it at the time and what it meant to me. A lot of it had to do with my frustration with having to become an adult and what it meant to be an adult male in American society. I didn&#8217;t want to be one, because all it was about was status. Consumerist success was really the embodiment of what it meant to be a cool guy.’<br />
&#8211; <a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/authors/interviews/article/47587-american-psycho-at-20-catching-up-with-bret-easton-ellis.html">Bret Easton Ellis, 2011</a></p>
<p>‘[Bateman] was crazy the same way [I was]. He did not come out of me sitting down and wanting to write a grand sweeping indictment of yuppie culture. It initiated because of my own isolation and alienation at a point in my life. I was living like Patrick Bateman. I was slipping into a consumerist kind of void that was supposed to give me confidence and make me feel good about myself but just made me feel worse and worse and worse about myself.’<br />
&#8211; <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/rage/archive/s3034896.htm">Bret Easton Ellis, 2010</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Fay Weldon, one of very few women to <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/1991/apr/25/fiction.breteastonellis">positively review</a> the novel, did so while emphasising its anti-capitalist aspects. <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Shopping-Space-American-Generation-Fiction/dp/1852422556/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1336917717&amp;sr=1-2">Elizabeth Young</a>, too, identified Patrick Bateman as not a character but a cipher indicating the nihilism and emptiness of yuppie culture and identity.</p>
<p>Bateman is of course capitalism’s dirty little secret &#8211; the madman in the attic. His sociopathy is mirrored in the socio-economic inequality and political insincerity around him. In his world, the atomised and alienated dealings of colleagues, friends and lovers are highlighted through contrast with the visceral intimacy of murder, and Ellis’ stylistic trick of detailing frenzied sex and violence in flat and clinically dispassionate prose does not disguise that as a form of human encounter it carries more weight than Bateman’s ritualised interactions with colleagues or his sexless and loveless interactions with girlfriends. His narration frequently betrays a yearning for consummation, contact and engagement in the midst of the desperate aching loneliness, the longing for meaning (even Bateman’s violence is purposeless and arbitrary) which permeates the book. In a society so unsustainably alienating and unequal that the centre plainly cannot hold, we see how badly things can fall apart.</p>
<h3>Psycho Drama</h3>
<p>Accused of having written ‘a how-to novel on the torture and dismemberment of women’, Ellis <a href="http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,313573,00.html">found himself</a> subject to boycotts, hate mail, death threats and violent revenge fantasies, on the basis that he had clearly written this book as either wish-fulfillment or glamorised incitement. Detractors of the book and author on these grounds display a puzzling inability to distinguish between creator and creation, which as a first principle is utterly bizarre – where is it written that characters must necessarily be extensions of an approving creator?</p>
<p>The novel contains a few dozen pages in amongst four hundred or so on the torture and dismemberment of women – and of men – though their impact is disproportionate. These scenes – often ludicrous, often grotesque to the point of comedy – are presented as a logical extension of the lack of empathy and mindless, numb urge to consume that characterise the world in which they take place. They don’t seem written in order to arouse any more than the determinedly un-erotic, sterile sex scenes do, or the interminable deconstructions of clothes, cosmetics and Huey Lewis’ back catalogue. The book gradually reaches a point where reading about all three feels indistinguishable in its horrific, unrelenting tedium.</p>

I got through these scenes gingerly on my first read, treating it as a kind of endurance test, but tend to skip them on subsequent reads as they aren&#8217;t the reasons I revisit the book. I read <strong>American Psycho</strong> in the same semi-masochistic spirit in which I watch, for instance, Chris Morris’ and Charlie Brooker’s hipster-eviscerating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Barley"><strong>Nathan Barley</strong></a>, a work also bleakly amusing, also received with disbelief and criticism of its gratuitousness, and also concerned with the consequences of elevating surface over meaning, although its slack-jawed, skinny-jeaned targets were more symptom than cause – and arguably Ellis had already been there, done that, too, with 1998’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glamorama"><strong>Glamorama</strong></a>. I read <strong>American Psycho</strong> like I’d read any work which explored capitalism, consumerism and their messy, distasteful effects, from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_to_the_End_of_the_Night"><strong>Voyage au bout de la nuit</strong></a> to <strong>The Hunger Games</strong>. (But not de Sade. Sometimes life’s just too short.)</p>
<p>Finally, if perhaps most obviously, it takes some effort to read Ellis’ presentation of Bateman’s attitude or actions as approving. Unlike, say, Thomas Harris depicting Hannibal Lecter, or the creators of <strong>Dexter</strong>, he gives his anti-hero little in the way of charisma or appeal. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Harron">Mary Harron</a>’s film of the novel, produced a decade after it when the stardust of the 1980s had settled somewhat, arguably does more than the book to establish Ellis’ unreliable narrator as a slick and stylish seducer rather than a pathetic interchangeable fantasist. Despite the <a href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/foreignc/2012/03/american-psycho.html">subversive</a> nature of Harron’s direction, Christian Bale&#8217;s <em>tour-de-force</em> performance renders Bateman far more compelling than his written incarnation, who is overtly racist, misogynistic and homophobic as well as dim, snobbish, superficial, chronically insecure, socially awkward, a hopeless conversationalist, and tediously obsessed with material goods. If it weren’t for the fact that almost every other character displays exactly the same character traits, it’s conceivable that the novel’s Bateman could make his dates expire of boredom without any need to break out the pneumatic nail-gun.</p>
<p>It’s interesting too that the film’s elevation of Bateman is bound up with its objectification of him, particularly via its concentration on his character’s <a href="http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=515985">proto</a>&#8211;<a href="http://www.marksimpson.com/pages/journalism/metrosexual_beckham.html">metrosexual </a>aspects, but that’s a whole other essay.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This post was sent in by reader and commenter Ribenademon as a response to another earlier guest post, <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/10/18/guest-post-thoughts-on-women-in-larp/"><strong>Some Thoughts On Women In LARP</strong></a>. Quick trigger warning: this post discusses some quite graphic misogynist language.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, we&#8217;ll conclude the discussion that first post has generated with a post from our own team, since we&#8217;re no strangers to LARP ourselves&#8230;</em><sup><a href="/2011/11/08/guest-post-women-and-larp-the-other-side-of-the-coin/#footnote_0_8034" id="identifier_0_8034" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" OK, not all of us. But a significant amount &ndash; about a third of the team &ndash; have LARPed at some point in their lives. Geek power at BadRep Towers! ">1</a></sup></p>
<p>LARP is sexist in the same way that many things we can know and touch in our society are sexist. It&#8217;s a broad sweep to say it is primarily played by white, male, ostensibly middle class individuals often lacking in social skills and hygiene, and it&#8217;s increasingly not true or fair to do so.</p>

I&#8217;ve been LARPing for about 11 years now.  It&#8217;s probably also appropriate to point out that I am a cis male and therefore I won&#8217;t experience sexism &#8211; at least, not in any way comparable to most female players. </p>
<p>LARP is, primarily, a male-dominated game &#8211; just on the basis of who attends. Women can and do come and play, but as Al notes in his post, it is often (though not exclusively) as tag-along girlfriend characters. Women who subvert this and succeed in the game, whilst sometimes respected, often become more of a target for &#8220;PVP&#8221; (&#8220;player versus player&#8221; conflict) than male players succeeding in the same manner, simply because they&#8217;ve deviated from an assigned social position.</p>
<p>In a highly anecdotal and unscientific manner I&#8217;m now going to list a few instances of sexist and/or straight up misogynist behaviour I&#8217;ve witnessed whilst LARPing. I&#8217;m listing them because I feel they most accurately depict common manifestations of sexism within LARP, and I promise they&#8217;re all true. They&#8217;re absolutely not true of every male player, but they do definitely exist and they&#8217;re not rare like a dinosaur. They&#8217;re also not especially true of one system over another.  </p>
<h3>&#8220;Humour&#8221; and Misogyny</h3>
<p>First off, myself and a NPC (non-player character) were standing around during a major Lorien Trust game watching people walk by. Half a dozen teenage girls in ballgowns walked past us. They were pretty smiley and seemed to be having a laugh in the sunshine.</p>
<p><strong>NPC:</strong> Aww, look at them! Don&#8217;t they look all bless and nice!<br />
<strong>Me:</strong> Aww, yeah!<br />
<strong>NPC:</strong> Fair play though, as soon as they hit the stroke of 16 they&#8217;re going to get the living fuck raped out of them.<br />
<strong>Me:</strong> WTF?!</p>
<p>The untyped climax of this story is that I said that this was not a cool or acceptable thing to say, and I did not think it was on. It had definitely been said in such a way as to suggest that such abuse would be quite desirable/fun were it to take place. My reaction caused a significant souring of attitude towards me both from the individual I had this exchange with and also from the people generally around this person &#8211; it was felt that I was making a fuss over nothing and should just &#8220;take a joke&#8221;. I&#8217;ve heard similar comments from other individuals and small groups, as far as I can remember though only when there was no female player or female member of staff around to overhear.</p>
<p>I can also cite numerous cases where a &#8220;provocatively&#8221; dressed female player was scorned and massively disparaged for &#8220;being a slag&#8221;. This often seems especially likely to happen if she has achieved some kind of success in the game, and it&#8217;ll range from jokes about what &#8220;whorish behaviour&#8221; must have taken place to get said advantages to just straight up behind-the-back savaging:</p>
<p><strong>Male Player 1:</strong> Yeah, I hear she&#8217;s a virgin.<br />
<strong>Male Player 2:</strong>  At this event, maybe.<br />
<strong>Male Player 3:</strong> If we went to kill her character, we could be half way through and then be like &#8220;OK, we won&#8217;t kill you if you suck us off&#8221;.<br />
<strong>Male Player 4: </strong>Then kill her anyway afterwards. If she complains to a ref just say she&#8217;s trying to get out of being killed because she&#8217;s a cheating bitch.</p>
<p>This sort of shared humour goes way beyond risky &#8220;laddish&#8221; jokes told privately amongst men, and in some cases actively steps towards hate. It also suggests that actual sexist action &#8211; even where it is less extreme than the above &#8211; is more and more being seen as okay (or desired?) at LARP amongst some parties.  </p>
<h3>Gender Roles</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s already been identified that women can play prostitutes or healers in many systems, and that alternatively they can make a push into a more &#8216;competitive&#8217; character that is less traditionally &#8216;feminine&#8217; (at least in terms of many LARPs&#8217; <em>expectation</em> of what is appropriate for a woman to play). Women who choose these characters may find they are competing with male player characters in a way that male characters do not have to. A male character that is not a caricature or inversion of masculinity can compete with any other character on the strengths and weaknesses of their character. A female player character, unless she wants to be ignored outside her group of mates in roleplay, can expect to be treated principally as a woman rather than as a magician or a priest or whatever else first &#8211; unless she is particularly vigorous IC and manages to defy being categorised as some kind of &#8220;slag&#8221; &#8211; or indeed &#8220;just&#8221; a female.</p>

<h3>Casual Sexism</h3>
<p>The above are fairly extreme examples of nastiness I&#8217;ve seen happen at LRP events, but there&#8217;s also milder general and casual sexism. Pleasingly, this sometimes goes wrong. About two years ago I was at an event where four very hard, very killy male combat characters all died from drinking the poison that a corseted and large breasted female character served them from a bottle of mead when she came into their camp. This is quite believable &#8211; boys are often stupid, and many like breasts, whilst also assuming that &#8220;girls are bound to be harmless&#8221;. A few camps down? Oh, how we laughed.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a good line in utilising sexism in this way that can be done by women at LARP events, although this is still arguably a hideous cop-out in terms of actually being able to play the same game as male players, on top of whether you find it distasteful or not. Some (usually) female players create characters who work in the in-character sex industry, the background to which rarely involves STIs, violence, drug abuse, sexual assault or any of the other issues of the real world sex industry. <a href="http://forum.rule7.co.uk/Topic116276-37-1.aspx?Highlight=sex">This is an interesting thread</a> off of the infamous Rule 7 forums about how to play through the in-character sex industry with &#8220;sex&#8221; as both a business transaction and a romantic interaction.  </p>
<p>It also cuts (very, very slightly) both ways: as a male player, I&#8217;ve played character types who were meant to be without gender or sexuality and found that some female players attempted to use what I&#8217;ve perceived as out-of-character flirting when interacting with me, probably because as a male player I&#8217;m perceived as potentially at least a bit sexist in my behaviour. A more advanced manifestation of sexism in LARP is what I like to think of as &#8220;harem&#8221; behaviour. This is where a female player deliberately cultivates around her &#8211; both in and out of character &#8211; a small collection of young men that follow her around and who do what she wants &#8211; in a way that I think is often distinct from simply being a female group leader with group members who happen to be male. I think I can see in this a recognition that some women feel they can&#8217;t compete in the same way as male players because of sexist attitudes and general uncomfortable treatment. Instead they may feel the need to cultivate a group of male characters to act through &#8211; or to provide enough security to roleplay with the rest of the field in such a way that is insulated on their terms, without being either leched at or just ignored. </p>
<h3>In LARP and in Life</h3>
<p>I think my main issue and argument is that all the examples above translate neatly across from real life. Sexism does happen a lot in real life, but there is an increasing social and political movement backed up by law to reduce and prevent discrimination. However, in a LARP game, there is only what players and system are prepared to step up against and say &#8220;NO&#8221; to. There is no standard of behaviour that can really be expected to be enforced beyond the absolutes of &#8220;no out of character violence&#8221;. This means people are free to avoid rewarding female characters in-game and can also get out of taking them seriously. If someone behaves in a sexist way, people might think less of them but often there&#8217;s still no threat of consequence. The behaviour that often goes on in the field, if it were relocated to an office, would result in investigation and employment tribunals, which illustrates how some men are able to get away with treating women in the field in a way they might not always in real life.</p>
<h3>The Plus Side</h3>
<p>Things are getting better &#8211; in real life, many men and women are increasingly unimpressed with sexism. Male and female staff exist in senior roles in more and more systems. One LARP system I&#8217;ve heard has allegedly cancelled the contract of a catering company at its festivals because of numerous complaints about its staff standing around loudly making rape jokes with customers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s certainly unfair to say that every man who plays is sexist or hates women, or agrees with the things they hear their mates say when standing around in the dark at an event. It&#8217;s just as unfair to say that every woman that plays is either a victim suffering from sexism, encouraging sexism in some way or having to engage with sexism all the time. It also wouldn&#8217;t be right to say that every female player is actively engaged in dealing with or fighting their way past sexism all the time as they try to enjoy the game &#8211; most of the time people care more about killing the undead, and a lot of the time sexism does not come up. After all, it wouldn&#8217;t be much of a fun game if it was always horrible. When it does go wrong, though, fantasy can be just as bad as some of reality.  </p>
<p>I would advise women that are into sci-fi or fantasy to go LARPing if they like the sound of it &#8211; I think it&#8217;s awesome &#8211; but I wouldn&#8217;t sell it to them as a completely optimistic, prejudice free, potentially feminist activity &#8211; at least, not any more or less than any other male dominated hobby.</p>

<li><em><strong>Ribenademon</strong> has been larping for 11 years since starting at university. He is very tall with laser beams for eyes; once mainly a purple demon, he now more often resembles a tall and angry tree focussing its efforts on fighting imaginary imperialism and colonialism, all the while appeasing its dark god. He also clearly spends too much time thinking about LARP. He looks forward to sacrificing you regardless of your gender.</em> </li>

<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>X is for <em>X</em> is unique among Alphabet posts in that the letter does not stand in for a word – like A for Amazon and B for Bitch – because, in fact, the letter <em>is </em>the word.</p>
<div id="attachment_4706" style="width: 217px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/eleanor-cross.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4706" data-attachment-id="4706" data-permalink="/2011/04/04/an-alphabet-of-feminism-24-x-is-for-x/eleanor-cross/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/eleanor-cross.jpg?fit=441%2C600&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="441,600" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="eleanor cross" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/eleanor-cross.jpg?fit=220%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/eleanor-cross.jpg?fit=441%2C600&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-4706   " src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/eleanor-cross.jpg?resize=207%2C281" alt="The Eleanor Cross at Charing Cross - an imposing gothic tower made out of stone, replacing an original of wood." width="207" height="281" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/eleanor-cross.jpg?w=441&amp;ssl=1 441w, https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/eleanor-cross.jpg?w=220&amp;ssl=1 220w" sizes="(max-width: 207px) 100vw, 207px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-4706" class="wp-caption-text">The Eleanor Cross replica at Charing Cross, London.</p></div>
<p>Yet this word – simultaneously standing in for itself and existing as an independent unit of meaning – is possibly one of the most widely-used symbols of all. How exactly this might be relevant to a consideration of feminism will be herein considered, but I hope my indulgent readers will excuse a slightly cheeky use of theoretical thinking. We all know each other well enough by now, don&#8217;t we?</p>
<h3>VCR</h3>
<p>The most straightforward significance of X is, as Latin-fans will know, &#8216;ten&#8217; / &#8217;10&#8217; (I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X). Two tens side by side is <em>XX</em>, or twenty / 20. How many tens can you think of? Ten lost tribes of Israel, ten commandments, ten plagues of Egypt, ten dimes in a dollar, ten years in a decade. It&#8217;s a pleasingly round number, and an easy times table, even if it frequently loses out to &#8216;twelve&#8217; / &#8217;12&#8217; in mystic significance.</p>
<p>But <em>x </em>is not simply a linguistic unit: it is also a visual one. Two diagonal lines; two Vs touching each other; a crossover; a cross; a cross-roads. Like &#8216;0&#8217;, which means &#8216;oh&#8217;, &#8216;o&#8217;, &#8216;zero&#8217; and &#8216;nothing&#8217;, it represents one of its meanings aesthetically: it is a <em>cross. </em>Thus King&#8217;s X and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_cross#Charing_.28now_Charing_Cross.29">Charing X</a> (this last was named for the <em>Eleanor Cross </em>built on the site by Richard I to commemorate the funeral procession of his wife) – but, perhaps because of its relationship to the Greek letter &#8216;Chi&#8217; (&#8216;Ch-&#8216;), which is the first letter of &#8216;Christ&#8217;, <em>x </em>can also signify he-who-died-on-a-cross (&#8216;<em>X-mas</em>&#8216;), although it actually looks more like the St. Andrew cross, which makes up the Scottish flag.</p>
<h3>Crystalised</h3>
<p>In numerical terms, though, <em>x </em>can also take on the role of an unknown quantity – &#8216;Find the value of <em>x</em>&#8216;, where the <em>x </em>is italicised to mark its distinction from &#8216;x&#8217;. It is &#8216;unknown&#8217;, not &#8216;multiply&#8217;, an absent value rather than a pluralised one. Here too, we bump into a common significance <em>x </em>has: it represents absence. It is the legal signature of the illiterate (&#8216;I cannot write; here is the <em>x </em>that represents &#8220;yes, I agree&#8221; but also &#8220;no, I cannot write&#8221;), and the standard stand-in for a quantity that is unknown or not yet provided (&#8216;Dear X&#8217;).</p>
<p>The unknown or unstated quantity has also fed over into censorship: an <em>X-rated </em>film is one only suitable for those aged over 18. It was replaced in 1982 by the &#8217;18&#8217; certificate, but such certificates have frequently been seen by directors as more of a target than an impediment: Hitchcock&#8217;s extremely grim <strong>Frenzy </strong>(1972) was conceived to coincide with the USA&#8217;s revised <em>R-rating</em> so that the Master of Suspense could claim his place in the pantheon of horror with a badge of censored honour.</p>

<p>This was his penultimate film, and the only one to carry an &#8217;18&#8217; certificate in the UK or receive an <em>&#8216;X-rating&#8217; </em>after the age restriction was moved up to 18 in 1971. It&#8217;s about a rapist serial-killer. If the accusation of misogyny leveled at him impedes your appreciation of Hitchcock&#8217;s films as a whole, I would not recommend this one. It features an extended rape scene shot with a disturbing emphasis on its supposed eroticism, and some true masterpieces of misogyny <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068611/quotes">in the dialogue</a>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRfbuQgJsjY">this scene</a>, which features Babs&#8217; death: from the moment Rust enters the frame we know she&#8217;s dead, and the line which precedes the attack, &#8216;You&#8217;re my kind of woman&#8217; (whose results we have already seen in graphic form on his previous victim) precedes one of Hitchcock&#8217;s most underrated panning shots: the camera backs out down the stairs and out into the street in what the director himself dubbed &#8216;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS77YJuiaw">Bye Bye To Babs</a>&#8216;. This is the second of the film&#8217;s rape-murders and one no less disturbing for being &#8216;exed out&#8217; – its self-censorship makes its own point.</p>
<p>There is a beautifully dark irony in how this most censored of Hitchcock&#8217;s films is also one focused almost entirely around silencing and deleting women – <em>exing </em>them by using the Latin prefix &#8216;out of, from, utterly, beyond&#8217; (<em>ex</em>), thus, in verbal form, &#8216;to delete, to cross off&#8217; (as in &#8216;to <em>x</em>&#8216;, to &#8216;cross&#8217;, which can also be &#8216;to thwart&#8217; – &#8216;Don&#8217;t cross me!&#8217;). This is the <em>x-</em>form that gives us &#8216;<em>ex-boyfriend, ex-girlfriend, ex-wife</em>&#8216;, so that the <em>x </em>acts as a negative, canceling out the word that follows it, making the <em>spouse </em>a <em>stranger</em>, and the act of so doing is, in fact, an act of deletion – &#8216;<em>exing</em>&#8216; someone, crossing them out (indeed, we frequently drop the specifics altogether, don&#8217;t we? &#8216;My ex&#8217;.)</p>
<p>If you buy the theory that Hitch was himself a Horrible Misogynist (which, with regret, I think I must – in this film at least) – the fact that he chose a kind of Jack the Ripper style return to his London roots for his attempt on the R-rating is a masterpiece of gyno-negation (yes I made that compound up, but I&#8217;m running with it):</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Solicitor in Pub</strong>: Let&#8217;s hope he slips up soon.<br />
<strong>Doctor in Pub</strong>: In one way I rather hope he doesn&#8217;t. We haven&#8217;t had a good juicy series of sex murders since Christie. And they&#8217;re so good for the tourist trade. Foreigners somehow expect the squares of London to be fog-wreathed, full of hansom cabs and *littered* with ripped whores, don&#8217;t you think?</p>
<p><strong>Frenzy </strong>(1972)</p></blockquote>
<h3>Heart Skipped A Beat</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 13px;">It is, then, fantastically dark yet undeniably fitting that <em>x </em>is frequently appropriated as a symbol of sexytimes: XXX (thirty) means &#8216;extra strong&#8217;, via an <em>x</em> homonym <em>extra</em>. Thus it is an identifier for pornography and <em>x-rated </em>movies, and, in the form <em>.xxx</em> is a &#8216;sponsored top level domain&#8217; (what?) intended as a voluntary option for porn sites (instead of .com, .co.uk etc), to allow clear classification and prevent The Children accessing such sites &#8216;by accident&#8217;. The difficulty here, of course, is that it requires binary identification of What Is Porn and What Is Not (of which more presently).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 13px;">In lower-case form, xxx connects love and lust: most people know of x = kiss (I&#8217;ve always wondered if there&#8217;s something in &#8216;k&#8217; being an &#8216;x&#8217; that may have hit a wall), but Wikipedia claims &#8216;xxx&#8217; means &#8216;I love you&#8217; through the power of three. Like &#8216;heart&#8217;, which is a very different thing from &#8216;love&#8217; (&#8216;I heart NY&#8217;), &#8216;X&#8217; is frequently something distinct from &#8216;kiss&#8217;, and rarely a simple representation of it. Just look at Holly Valance, whose 2002 single &#8216;<a href="http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/98969/">Kiss Kiss</a>&#8216; (and its predictably lips-obsessed <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAkUtig5iG4">video)</a> repeatedly blocks out what comes after &#8216;my&#8230;&#8217;, replacing it with a &#8216;mwah mwah&#8217; which is frequently not even mimed in the video, and, as the song progresses, gets increasingly mixed out, blanked out and fragmented.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Don&#8217;t play the games that you play<br />
&#8216;Cause you know that I won&#8217;t run away<br />
Why aren&#8217;t you asking me to stay<br />
&#8216;Cause tonight I&#8217;m gonna give you my (mwah mwah)</p>
<p>&#8211; Holly Valance, <strong>&#8216;Kiss Kiss&#8217;</strong> (2002)</p></blockquote>
<p>Where this is all leading is, of course, &#8216;tonight I&#8217;m gonna give you my XX&#8217;&#8230; which is also &#8216;my XXX&#8217;. Add to this the traditional association of mouths and vaginas (whose natural endpoint is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina_dentata">vagina dentata</a>, whence a man &#8216;always leaves diminished&#8217;) and you have a really rather porno-tastic song all round (yet one that would never come with a domain name culminating with .xxx).</p>
<h3>Basic Space</h3>
<p>By contrast, xoxo means &#8216;kiss, hug, kiss, hug&#8217; (less sexual all round) and is another way of using letters as symbols for something else – O is &#8216;hug&#8217; because it enfolds itself, yet that self-enclosure also makes it 0 = nothing. To borrow the assumptions of the seventeenth century, this &#8216;nothing&#8217; is also equivalent to &#8216;cunt&#8217;, since it is an empty space (as in Rochester&#8217;s poem &#8216;<a href="http://oldpoetry.com/opoem/show/16664-Lord-John-Wilmot-Upon-Nothing">Upon Nothing</a>&#8216;, which describes &#8216;nothing&#8217; as &#8216;a great unite<em>D What</em>&#8216; (pronounce &#8216;what&#8217; to rhyme with &#8216;cat&#8217; to get &#8216;<a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/01/31/an-alphabet-of-femininism-16-p-is-for-pussy/">pussy</a>&#8216;)). Similarly, in <strong>Hamlet</strong>, Ophelia tells the protagonist she thinks &#8216;nothing&#8217; – which, he replies, is &#8216;a pretty thought to lie between maids&#8217; legs&#8217;, and (given that &#8216;th&#8217; was frequently pronounced &#8216;t&#8217; in the sixteenth century), in the light of this you may wish to reconsider the meaning of Shakespeare&#8217;s title &#8216;Much Ado About Nothing&#8217;. There is a curious irony here in the use of &#8216;x&#8217; and &#8216;o&#8217; side by side: one crosses out and refuses, the other is &#8216;nothing&#8217; in the first place.</p>
<h3>Stars</h3>
<p>You have all been mighty patient, but here I draw towards a conclusion: <em>x </em>is a letter so many-layered as to refuse any comprehensive analysis. But this is itself quite appropriate, because those of its meanings I have looked at here all hinge around negation or deletion. That these should happen to focus around sex and (specifically) the vagina is not necessarily something intrinsic to the letter, but it certainly tells you a lot about how that letter is used. Blocked out, crossed out; rendered titillating or exciting; exclusive or exclusionary –<em> exit</em>, stage right.</p>
