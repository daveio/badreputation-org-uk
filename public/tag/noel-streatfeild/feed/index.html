<p>She has a dizzying list of titles to her name, of which I managed to snatch only a portion: most people have heard of <strong>Ballet Shoes</strong>, and, for many, it was a defining childhood book. It&#8217;s a critics&#8217; and writers&#8217; pet: (Dame) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacqueline_Wilson">Jacqueline Wilson</a> cites it as her &#8220;all-time favourite children&#8217;s book&#8221;, and the BBC has twice adapted it for television. Lots of people also know about the other &#8216;Shoes&#8217; books: <strong>Dancing Shoes</strong>, <strong>White Boots</strong>, <strong>Tennis Shoes</strong>, <strong>Ballet Shoes for Anna</strong> and the Carnegie award-winning <strong>The Circus Is Coming</strong>, but maybe less are familiar with <strong>The Children of Primrose Lane, Party Shoes, </strong>the <strong>Gemma </strong>books, or <strong>Caldicott Place</strong>. Certainly, her considerable output of books for adults has largely gone unnoticed (one of which formed the basis for <strong>Ballet Shoes </strong>itself) and I myself have only read one: <strong>Saplings</strong>, an experimental novel that explores contemporary thought about child psychology in the aftermath of war. Somewhat disturbingly, it is still written from Streatfeild&#8217;s distinctive &#8216;child&#8217;s-eye-view&#8217;, from which vantage point it addresses issues as varied as depression, alcoholism, sex, bed-wetting, bereavement and female self-esteem (not all at once, of course).</p>

<p>It has been often commented that Streatfeild&#8217;s gift is her ability to establish a rapport with her reader: she never talks down to children, and deals with difficult topics in the same way she describes everyday occurrences. Her commitment to realism in writing extends to her habit of painstakingly explaining what all the characters are thinking at all times. Thus, in <strong>Dancing Shoes</strong>, the just-orphaned Rachel is considered unloving and aggressive because she took her mother&#8217;s death with equanimity: we the readers, on the other hand, are kept aware of Rachel&#8217;s trials &#8211; how she scowls to keep from crying and wants to avoid any questions that might set her off. The child-reader is nevertheless forced to see the situation from at least two perspectives simultaneously, a common approach to Literature since Samuel Richardson, but amazingly innovative in writing for children. The result is a style that demands a responsibility from its readers as well as understanding: it accepts that life is often unfair, but invites children to consider how best to respond.</p>
<p>Streatfeild was famously the &#8216;unattractive&#8217; middle girl in a clergyman&#8217;s family of three daughters. After the &#8216;beautiful child&#8217; tradition of nineteenth-century children&#8217;s literature (best represented by <strong>Frances Hodgson Burnett</strong> and <strong>Lewis Carroll</strong>), her novels frequently focus on the rebellious, the stubborn and the plain, than which no better example exists than the &#8216;black-doggish&#8217; Jane Winter in <strong>The Painted Garden</strong>, which meta-fictionally reworks Hodgson Burnett&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_Garden">most famous novel</a> on a film set in Hollywood. In the absence of naive beauty and idyllic country settings, her characters must make their way on merit, and, not only plain, they are often money-minded to a startling degree: &#8220;The law lets me work; I don&#8217;t need a licence, and I can do what I like with my own money,&#8221; asserts Pauline, in <strong>Ballet Shoes</strong>, at fourteen (and she gets her way).</p>

<p>The central conceit of this novel<strong> </strong>&#8211; the absence of Great Uncle Matthew (&#8220;Gum&#8221;), who adopts the three &#8216;Fossils&#8217; and then dashes off to &#8220;some strange islands&#8221; &#8211; means that the book features an essentially all-female cast. Aside from the Fossils themselves &#8211; Pauline, Petrova and Posy &#8211; the house in Cromwell Road also contains Sylvia, the children&#8217;s guardian (&#8220;Garnie&#8221;); Nana, a no-nonsense disciplinarian; Theo Dane, a dancing teacher at the Children&#8217;s Academy of Dancing and Stage Training, and Dr Smith and Dr Jakes, doctors of Maths and English respectively. These last two later move on to &#8220;a charming flat in Bloomsbury&#8221; and although aged seven I never thought to ask why two female doctors should have to live together, now I wonder if Streatfeild has not rather audaciously put a lesbian couple in a 1930s kids&#8217; book (there are some rumours about the nature of the friendships she shared with women herself, and she has been claimed variously for a lesbian and an asexual). Certainly the illustration of the Doctors by Ruth Gervis suggests she saw it that way, even if Streatfeild may not have done: they are depicted in a stereotypical style that has barely changed since the novel was written in 1936.</p>
<p>The only man in sight, apart from the absent Gum, is Mr Simpson, a border who teaches Petrova all about cars and then must go back to his &#8216;rubber trees&#8217; in Kuala Lumpur. And while Pauline and Posy have looks and interests to endear them to the most pink and fluffy reader going, Petrova remains as stubbornly boyish as that perennially scruffy heroine of female fiction, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Women"><strong>Little Women</strong></a>&#8216;s Jo: when the dancing school plan is first mentioned, Nana hopes it will &#8220;turn her more like a little lady&#8221; &#8211; Petrova &#8220;never plays with dolls, and takes no more interest in her clothes than a scarecrow&#8221;.</p>
<p>Alas for Nana, Petrova ends up spending auditions &#8220;flying an imaginary airplane on a new route to China&#8221;, and by the end of the book, is a determined aviator: &#8220;Amy Mollison and Jean Batten will be [in the history books], but not as important at you&#8221;, promises Pauline, imagining the distinctly un-fluffy story such books will tell: &#8216;[She] found routes by which goods could be carried at greater speed and less cost, and so she revolutionized trade.&#8221; Hardly the dreams of a &#8216;beautiful child&#8217;.</p>
<p>For Petrova, as for so many of Streatfeild&#8217;s children not given to performing art (and there are a surprising number, despite her reputation), the most important lesson of stage school is self-sufficiency, a goal underlined across all the books by the fact that the overwhelming majority of child-characters have no parents to speak of, or are lumbered with a domineering guardian to struggle against (notably in <strong>Ballet Shoes For Anna</strong> and <strong>White Boots</strong>). With their realist emphasis, and the lessons that &#8216;even&#8217; little girls can get on in a world assailed by stupidity, war, and even natural disasters, I can think of no better author to recommend to absolutely everyone you know.</p>

<h3><strong>Sonic Nurse</strong></h3>
<p>After the army of Important Academic Languages, and their Distinguished And Layered Relationship With Modern English, we reach this. <em>N</em><em>anny </em>has no real relation to Latin, Greek, French, Middle or even Old English, but derives from &#8216;a child&#8217;s corruption of the word <em>nurse</em>&#8216;, tellingly akin to <em>mamma</em>. <em>Nurse</em>, it must be granted,<em> </em>has slightly more pedigree: it derives from the twelfth-century Old French term <em>norrice</em>,<em> </em>via the Latin <em>nutricius </em>(=<em> </em>&#8216;that suckles, nourishes&#8217;). It<em> </em>first appears in 1530 as a verb &#8216;to suckle&#8217;, and as a noun fifty years later, where it has the meaning we probably use most often: &#8216;one who takes care of the sick&#8217;.</p>

<p><em>Nanny</em> is first cited as an independent word meaning &#8216;a child&#8217;s nurse-maid&#8217; in 1795, whence it proves itself as fluid as you would expect, also encompassing a quasi-proper name, <em>Nana</em> (Cf. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUhwA-C-ACg">Katy Nana</a> in <strong>Mary Poppins</strong>, and the Newfoundland dog in <strong>Peter Pan</strong>). In 1830s America, we meet another deviant form of the same idea: <em>mammy,</em> a dialect corruption of <em>mamma</em> referring to &#8216;a black woman who looks after white children&#8217;. In extended form, <em>mammy </em>refers to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammy_archetype">racial stereotype</a>: &#8216;the loud, overweight and good natured black woman&#8217;, epitomised (in proper name form) in <strong>Gone With The Wind</strong>, and controversially brought to life in an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92kLpKuRJfo">Oscar-winning performance</a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hattie_McDaniel">Hattie McDaniel</a> (above, right). And it&#8217;s not all the Americans: this phenomenon has certain similarities to the British use of native women as nursemaids in colonial India, <em>ayah</em>s, so named in reference to the Hindi word meaning &#8216;nurse&#8217;.</p>

<p>All this leads back to one place: the whistleblowing potential of an <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/11/29/an-alphabet-of-femininism-9-i-is-for-infant/">infant&#8217;s cries</a>, in this instance naming the truly maternal figure in their formative years. But then, of course, until the late eighteenth century (the nineteenth, in France), no fashionable woman would even consider nursing her own child: on the contrary, <em>wet nursing </em>(sending your kid out to be suckled by a hired breast) was so common as to be automatic. Newborns were generally sent away for up to two years to be <em>nourished</em>, at a rate of anything from a few shillings a week to between £25 &#8211; 50 a year.</p>
<p>The reasons were as varied as the price, spanning the apparently trivial (social custom, and the desire to return to public life ASAP); the medical (fears for the mother&#8217;s health after the strain of lying in <em>sans </em>twenty-first century advantages), and the &#8216;medical&#8217; (the widespread notion that sex with a nursing woman would damage her milk and therefore the child, and the belief that conception was impossible during this time anyway). It also seems possible that rampant infant mortality may have contributed: parents would send their children away until they had survived their most dangerous years, rather than invest emotional energy in a little&#8217;un who might well leave you before their first birthday.</p>
<p>That said, the enduring influence of the nanny <em>qua</em> mother-figure lasted long into the twentieth century, albeit mostly among the mega-aristocracy: <strong>The King&#8217;s Speech </strong>(2011) imagines the future George VI to have been closer to his nannies than his family; one of these, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Bill">Charlotte Bill</a>, was famously also an effective mother to his autistic and epileptic younger brother, Johnny (re-created in the 2003 BBC serial <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lost_Prince">The Lost Prince</a></strong>).</p>

<p>The women who actually did all this nursing were inevitably of a lower social class than their clients – if not a different race – although they could earn good money (and possibly a nice pension) in the process. Here we tumble into a parallel nanny universe: the word in its more formal sense originating from another <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/10/25/an-alphabet-of-femininism-4-d-is-for-doll/">proper name</a><em>. </em>Through a bit of shuffling, good old <em>Ann</em> became first <em>Nan</em> and then <em>Nanny</em>, in which incarnation, around 1788, the word came to simply connote femininity, as in <em>Nanny-goat </em>(= &#8216;a female goat&#8217;, on which see also &#8216;Jenny Wren&#8217; and &#8216;jenny-ass&#8217;). Like <em>Doll</em>, Nan&#8217;s trajectory suggests commonness, generic feminine identity, and while the dictionary is specific on the two <em>nannies</em>&#8216; separation, its stated origin in an infant&#8217;s mouth is by definition uncertain, language development fluid, and the connections between milking and the farmyard in need of little exposition – compare the nineteenth-century term <em>baby farmer</em>, a lower-class wet nurse happy to let her charges die because her one-off fee encouraged little else. The term was always pejorative, and synonymous with the dangerous, non-nurturing female.</p>
<p>In contrast, we have the <em>nannies </em>who stayed with one family for generations (like the <em>mammy</em> and the <em>ayah </em>abroad): these last are inevitably conventionally &#8216;older&#8217; than their baby-farming colleagues, and presumably played a more extended mothering role. It is these strange insider-outsiders who appear in literature as bawdy and decrepit old women, inevitably depicted as their job title suggests: firmly on the side of the children they raise, to the extent that they will happily aid their improper sexual dalliances. It is thus that the <em>Nurse</em> appears in <strong>Romeo and Juliet</strong>, and in Keats&#8217; <strong>The Eve of St. Agnes</strong>. The suspicion inevitably directed at these figures is certainly class-based: wet nursing&#8217;s detractors had been arguing for years that by withholding mothers&#8217; milk parents risked their children absorbing working-class mannerisms – and criminal tendencies – from their surrogate teats.</p>
<h3>Na na na na na.</h3>
<p>The next stop for the <em>nanny </em>is in the inter-war years, with representatives including P.L. Travers&#8217; <strong>Mary Poppins</strong>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Now_We_Are_Six">poems </a>of A. A. Milne, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noel_Streatfeild">Noel Streatfeild</a>&#8216;s legion of sexless &#8216;cottage loaf&#8217; Nanas. Streatfeild&#8217;s children are almost invariably orphaned, and their Nana-figure keeps them nourished through &#8216;nursery ways&#8217;, a stubborn lack of sentimentality, and a feeling of permanence sadly lacking in the increasingly fragmented world of war-torn Britain. A similar idea is repeated in the 1964 Disney film of Travers&#8217; novel, which makes the significant decision to backdate events to 1910, when the focus is on &#8216;moulding the breed&#8217; for future colonial greatness:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIamxYhVfnI">A British nanny must be a general! </a><br />
The future empire lies within her hands.<br />
And so the person that we need<br />
To mould the breed<br />
Is a nanny who can give commands!</p>
<p>Walt Disney&#8217;s <strong>Mary Poppins </strong>(1964)</p></blockquote>
<p>In so doing, Disney&#8217;s film situates the<em> nanny </em>as part of &#8216;tradition, discipline and rules&#8217;, nurturing Britain&#8217;s future rather than its children, and flying in the face of its very etymology.</p>
<p>Mr Banks&#8217; song does, however, lead us to the final stop on <em>nanny&#8217;</em>s childishly simple word-journey: its modern incarnation as the Dreaded <em>Nanny State </em>(first appearing some time between the fifties and sixties). Always an opprobrious term (<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4044815.stm">attempts to re-appropriate it</a> have met with derision)  critics of government intervention ranging from the welfare state to the smoking ban hark back to the <em>nanny </em>to point up &#8216;mollycoddling&#8217;, the infantalisation of the people (who are presumably thus reduced to the baby-talk of the nursery) returning to <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=F3vwrJQWukUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false">childhood with a fussy female at the helm</a>. Wash your face, dearie.</p>
