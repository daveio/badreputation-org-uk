					<description><![CDATA[She deserves a better class of memorialist.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/CajpSeUvCPY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amywinehouse.com/" target="_blank">Amy Winehouse</a>, for all the typically Machiavellian marketing behind her early development and signing, was an atypical star to launch, even before the drink, drugs, bisexuality, tattoos and self-harm and sprawling domestic disharmony on the streets of Camden set in. 2003 was a year of slickly manufactured, crowdpleasing pop anthems spawned by reality tv or established industry hit machines: Britney, Christina, Avril, Beyoncé, Sugababes, Rachel Stevens, Girls Aloud. In this climate, Winehouse&#8217;s debut <strong>Frank</strong>, an engagingly personal and subtly powerful blend of jazz, soul, dub and heavy drinking, stood out as an album of grit among gloss, accomplished and ambitious, recalling the eclectic and impeccably imperious style of Dinah Washington and Nina Simone.</p>
<p>Equally, despite her status as a product of the Sylvia Young and Brit stage schools, Winehouse was hardly manufactured, having been a genuinely talented singer, guitarist and songwriter from a young age. The lyrics she produced and her delivery of them were cool, critical and cynical – <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVaqQe3V498" target="_blank">&#8216;Fuck Me Pumps&#8217;</a> is a punchily sung and scathing dismissal of the dominant gold-digging paradigm. Her definitive, self-mythologising single <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LTPRJqt2z4" target="_blank">&#8216;Rehab&#8217;</a>, despite its refrain&#8217;s predictable propensity to generate tasteless jokes and mawkish headlines in the wake of her death, is a staggering song of self-awareness, wiped clean of messy emoting or self-pity and resolutely swerving any courting of sorrow or sympathy. Its protagonist does not bewail her fate in the clasp of addiction but makes her refusal to be pathologised an active and empowering choice – &#8216;no, no, no&#8217; means no. Like much of Winehouse&#8217;s material, the song addresses and analyses addiction, dependency, depression and the complexities of female independence with a wry, arch, clear-eyed and mocking wit that could have leavened the weight of many a confessional memoir.</p>
<p>To evaluate Winehouse&#8217;s career as a story of potential unfulfilled, as many obituaries are doing, is to ignore the quality of second album <strong>Back to Black</strong>, with its clutch of BRITs, Grammys and Ivor Novellos, as well as the sheer depth of its influence. Winehouse&#8217;s international success began a scramble by record companies to scrounge up similar eclectic and experimental female artists. It is perhaps unfortunate that all this process actually got us was an indistinguishable female-centred quirk-quake comprised of <a href="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article6725104.ece" target="_blank">Little Pixie Roux and the Machine for Lashes</a>, as well as current favourites Adele and Duffy – both well-behaved, clean and immaculately blue-eyed biters of a vintage musical style which Winehouse had almost singlehandedly reinvigorated. For all their undoubted technical ability, such singers purvey blandly perfect reproductions of retro soul, whereas Winehouse was able to inhabit past musical modes like she wore her Ronettes-inspired beehive, investing them with something contemporary and compelling through that awesome, syrupy, rolling contralto. Her aesthetic – glamorously grubby, leonine and Cleopatra-eyed – was similarly inimitable and atypical. Even Lady Gaga <a href="http://www.popeater.com/2009/03/16/lady-gaga-loves-strange-girls-like-amy-winehouse/" target="_blank">credited </a>Winehouse with smoothing the path to mainstream success for other &#8216;strange girls&#8217;.</p>
<p>The tributes to Amy Winehouse clotting the front pages this past weekend reflect the other aspect of her fame: the purpose she served as media cipher. The narrative into which she was coralled – discovered, lauded, rewarded, exploited, drug-ravaged and wrung dry by the cynics and sycophants around her – is a traditional trajectory for women in the public eye, from Marilyn to Britney. Mixed in with the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/may/06/amy-winehouse-jean-rhys-addiction" target="_blank">clichés </a>of the demon-driven artist, Winehouse&#8217;s dedication to the life of a good-time girl provided an obvious temptation for the press to shoehorn the shapeless and slippery business of living into a rigid mould of Meaning, to make her a signifier of the plagues afflicting modern womanhood &#8211; not all of modern womanhood, of course, just those of us susceptible to the lure of urban independence and its giddy, glittering thrills.</p>
<p>There is an obvious irony in the fact that the media&#8217;s very concentration on her as a reliably scandalous page-filler embedded her in public consciousness as not an artist but a cautionary tale of misjudged relationships and worse-judged substance indulgence, eliciting a weird and volatile mixture of compassion and contempt. There was, too, a ghoulish and lascivious edge to public concern over Winehouse &#8211; as there was, back in the day, over Courtney Love and, latterly, Britney Spears &#8211; which is seldom present in attitudes to their male counterparts. The same organs which engorged themselves with pictures of Winehouse in her various stages of decline, distress and debauchery are continuing to objectify and sensationalise her as, inevitably, a &#8216;brilliant but troubled&#8217; combination of tragic loss and dreadful warning. She deserves a better class of memorialist.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the morning of the Royal Wedding, the street outside BadRep Towers was <em>saturated</em> with grown women wearing plastic tiaras. Rob and I became vaguely concerned we might get turned into pumpkins or something, and decided to take refuge in the (weirdly, wonderfully empty) British Museum for the day to regain a sense of perspective.  </p>
<p>But it seems we&#8217;re all in the pink plastic grip of fantasy princesshood, so I&#8217;ve decided to give in for a moment and take a look at some fairytale-themed pop music &#8211; but with a little bit of smarts and sass thrown in. Songs that turn tropes upside down or inside out, or give the princesses unexpected vigourous voice. In this post-<strong>Shrek</strong> epoch we&#8217;re living in, it&#8217;s a pretty well-travelled road, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it isn&#8217;t fun. </p>
<p>The reliably-entertaining folks over at <strong>Comics Alliance </strong>are also having a <a href="http://www.comicsalliance.com/2011/04/28/best-princesses-comic-book/">Princess Moment</a>, which this post is intended as a sort of humorous companion to. It&#8217;s not really an Order of Preference so much as a Pile of Stuff, because I&#8217;m not in the mood today to be ranking things in a heirarchy. A Pile of Stuff is way better. </p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: </strong>This isn&#8217;t, of course, the be-all and end-all of anything &#8211; just a personal take &#8211; so I&#8217;d love to hear your own suggestions in the comments, with no rules on style! The only rules were 1) fairytale themed; and 2) attempting (if not always succeeding) to do something interesting. </p>
<p><strong>PART ONE OF MIRANDA&#8217;S PILE OF POP PRINCESSERY, FROM 10 to 6!</strong></p>
<p><strong>10. Janelle Monae: <em>Sir Greendown</em> </strong></p>
<p><iframe width="425" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/mwZdq_CAYS4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>I throw up my hands here &#8211; this is a flagrant excuse for me to talk about <strong>Janelle Monae</strong>. Her image is more <a href="http://www.jmonae.com/">robot warrior rock star</a> than princess. This track is one of her dreamier moments, and I admit that aside from a faintly Angela Carter-esque <em>meet me at the tower/the dragon wants a bite/of our love </em>moment, it&#8217;s actually pretty straightforward prince-awaitin&#8217; fare &#8211; but actually that makes it a funny little island in the context of the rest of her work (check out the bolshy Motown-tinged slice of pure aural glory that is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HLtFhFYrw"><strong>Violet Stars Happy Hunting!</strong></a> and you&#8217;ll see what I mean). Monae is fond of her concept albums, and  <a href="http://io9.com/#!5592174/janelle-monae-turns-rhythm-and-blues-into-science-fiction">combines a sci-fi android alter-ego</a> with a deep- seated love for <strong>The Wizard of Oz</strong>. But the forbidden love of her android persona Cyndi Mayweather and the human millionaire Greendown (the storyline of her album and EPs) kinda is a space-age fairytale. (Oh, and go and listen to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv10t488Zpo&#038;feature=fvwrel"><strong>Wondaland</strong></a>, too.)</p>
<p><strong>9. Kate Bush: <em>The Red Shoes</em></strong></p>
<p><iframe width="425" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/GXTRe9ttMXw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Because it&#8217;s good to be obvious. For the unfamiliar, Kate made an entire album based on both the <strong>Hans Christian Anderson</strong> fairytale of the same name (as well as the 1948 film, which also drew on the same text). The story itself is unrivalled, if nightmarish, lecturing Victoriana is your thing &#8211; <a href="http://hca.gilead.org.il/red_shoe.html">read Anderson&#8217;s text here and cringe!</a> &#8211; but for Bush it proved fertile songwriting ground. The story&#8217;s about a girl whose vain attraction to a pair of red shoes (RED! IN CHURCH! SCANDAL) is punished by an angel &#8211; she finds she is unable to take the shoes off, or stop dancing, and ends up having to ask the local executioner to cut off her feet. Which then chase her around. Yeah, her disembodied feet, still dancing, follow her around and haunt her. In the end she repents thoroughly &#8230;and dies. As you do. Kate Bush&#8217;s version, on the other hand, is a hymn to <em>dancing the dream and making the dream come true</em> and enjoying your desires, even so-called dangerous ones. Or as Prof Bonnie Gordon puts it in <a href="http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&#038;q=cache:5FTi1p30pV0J:artsandsciences.virginia.edu/music/graduate/documents/BonnieGordon_KateBush.pdf+kate+bush%27s+subversive+shoes&#038;hl=en&#038;gl=uk&#038;pid=bl&#038;srcid=ADGEESiS7rJkuGpbPUngBr-4w6CWfYgUyBnthIRsHhp_K6PtyIGEhDJqjvS4H3Dpob5LCgnXnAjpMq8TAw08RO3qLlatYZPWZ7jORuVkAa5v7p5rR_vjdCEJr7eTOIiQ5k3Z9kkpBGjg&#038;sig=AHIEtbTwO6ITJa6nK1EyHD2NVZlAX0onbw&#038;pli=1">this essay</a>, &#8220;by singing and reclaiming this story meant to constrain women’s bodies and their erotic potential, Bush confronts and overturns its original inherent violence.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>8. Emilie Autumn: <em>Shallott</em></strong></p>
<p><iframe width="425" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/tpXdNaXYysk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Ah, Madame Autumn. Prone to self-indulgence on occasion she may be (<strong>The Art of Suicide</strong> just bores me, for example) but when she&#8217;s on form, she&#8217;s good fun. I much prefer her when she&#8217;s interacting with a story or old folk tale trope that already exists, like, say, with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuUNF735TA"><strong>Rose Red </strong></a>from her debut album <strong>Enchant</strong>, as opposed to when she&#8217;s languidly drawling about how <strong>Dead Is The New Alive</strong> on far less ethereal later LP <strong>Opheliac</strong>. Here&#8217;s <strong>Shallott</strong>, in which the famous tragic lady of Arthurian legend and Tennyson&#8217;s poem gets a soapbox of her own. Driven to distraction by sheer boredom, preternaturally aware that her life story&#8217;s already been written for her, archly quoting her own poem, and almost determined to die as flamboyantly as possible, Autumn&#8217;s take on the Lady may be angsty, but she&#8217;s also deliciously sarcastic &#8211; <em>now some drama queen is gonna write a song for me!</em>, she spits. Worth braving the gothic-girl-lost frills and flounces for. </p>
<p><strong>7. CocoRosie: <em>Werewolf</em></strong></p>
<p><iframe width="425" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/51K4cUTuvc0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>When I saw CocoRosie live a year or two ago, they took the stage in fake moustaches and proceeded to blow me away. Lyrically, only they know what <strong>Werewolf</strong> is really about, but I love the sudden changes of direction, the stream-of-consciousness narratives, and the thoughtful melancholy that hangs around my speakers in clouds after the music&#8217;s stopped playing.  <em>Corny movies make me reminisce / They break me down easy on this generic love shit / First kiss frog and princess &#8230; I&#8217;m-a shake you off though, get up on that horse and / Ride into the sunset, look back with no remorse&#8230;</em> </p>
<p><strong>6. Skye Sweetnam: <EM>Part Of Your World</EM></strong></p>
<p><iframe width="425" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/0HP4sDlzI0M" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>I wanted to include a Disney cover- something done as a pop-punk number with a gutsy, bouncy female vocal. In my head, with a change of context, some spit and elbow grease, the song might come out kinda like the Disney Princess version of No Doubt&#8217;s<strong> Just A Girl</strong>. </p>
<p>A survey of YouTube&#8217;s trove of punk/rock Disney covers reveals a really male-heavy bunch of bands. (Ladies, where are you? Where&#8217;s my hardcore cover of <strong>Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo</strong>, eh?) This was the closest match for a female-voxed attempt at this song (Ariel&#8217;s big ballady number from <strong>The Little Mermaid</strong>) that YouTube could offer me &#8211; I&#8217;d have preferred something rougher round the edges, but it&#8217;s still good fun. Avril-esque <strong>Skye Sweetnam</strong>, then: she&#8217;s supported Britney live, provided Barbie&#8217;s singing voice on a Mattel DVD, fronts metal band <strong>Sumo Cyco</strong> &#8211; VARIED CAREER TRAJECTORY &#8211; and overall sounds like <strong>Bif Naked</strong> on a sugar high (no bad thing in my book). Album B-side <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ndfEcAp5UM"><strong>Wolves and Witches</strong></a> is also sugary fun, if lyrically a bit join-the-dots. </p>
<p>Haters should note that <strong>Miley Cyrus</strong> has also had a crack at this song, and by God, she phones it in like nobody&#8217;s business, making Skye&#8217;s effort sound edgier than Stravinsky&#8217;s Rite of Spring by comparison.</p>
<p>SO! <em>Readers.</em> Could you do better than Skye? Dust off your Fender. Record it. Get in touch. And I will lavish THE FAME OF BADREP upon you. Provided you don&#8217;t sound like a cat in a tumble dryer.  (Possibly even if you do.) Extra points if you do <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDMfpbdbHWg"><strong>Gaston</strong></a> from <strong>Beauty and the Beast</strong> as a B-side. No wildly feminism-relevant reason. I just like it. (<em>I use antlers in all of my DECCCC-o-rating&#8230;</em>)</p>
<p>On that note, come back tomorrow morning for <strong>Part Two</strong>, in which we discover why <strong>Nicki Minaj</strong>, <strong>Paramore</strong>, and &#8230; <strong>Benjamin Zephaniah </strong>(trust me, he&#8217;s relevant) are rubbing shoulders.</p>
