					<description><![CDATA[There are those who believe men cannot identify themselves as feminists. Here's why I'm not one of them. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>It&#8217;s a guest post! Please welcome <a href="http://www.allquietonthewenchfront.blogspot.com/">Becky Shepherd</a> to the soapbox. (And if you&#8217;ve got a guest post, send a short pitch to <a href="mailto:badrepeditors@gmail.com">badrepeditors@gmail.com</a>).</em></strong></p>
<p>The subjection to online abuse of female writer sorts is something that has, of late, been widely discussed. The press appear to perceive it as a non-issue, even though there resides a catalogue of women who’ve experienced this kind of backlash, ranging from the latently patronising to intimidating and violent threats. But a new twist came when <a href="http://www.spectator.co.uk/nickcohen/7457633/a-regiment-of-women-monsterers.thtml">Nick Cohen wrote an article</a> defending writers Laurie Penny, Polly Toynbee and Melanie Phillips &#8211; and condemning the vitriol that they in particular experience when passing comment in the mainstream press. His bone of contention is not that any of these women face criticism; that’s a given if you make known your judgement on highly emotive issues. What he does have a problem with, however, is that these journalists encounter very personal, sexually abrasive and downright scary comments because they are women, and that these comments specifically target their womanhood. He even goes as far as to blame the “complicity of newspaper managers” whom he believes do very little to deter this type of victimisation and actively “demean” their female staff.</p>
<p>Seems a commendable sentiment, does it not?</p>
<p>The problem then became that he was zealously praised for bringing these virtual misogynistic tirades to light, despite the fact that female bloggers have been persistently trying to get their mistreatment taken seriously. Feminists are angry that Cohen rode in on his horse, waving his gallant testimony, rescuing the damsels and making this concern valid, like it wasn’t already. Nicky Woolf, another New Statesman voice, <a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/the-staggers/2012/01/women-rights-feminist-male">wrote a counter piece</a> claiming that “male supporters of women&#8217;s rights risk looking like ‘white knights’” and subsequently raised the question: can a man ever really call himself a feminist? There followed a lot of dictionary definitions of feminism and references to the multifarious tapestry that is social theory.</p>

<p>There are those who believe men cannot identify themselves as feminists. End of. The argument being that unless you relentlessly suffer under patriarchy, you can’t comprehend the impact it has on your very existence. I do appreciate this school of thought, and it’s used for many other social prejudices, including racism. The reason I don’t agree with it though, is twofold; firstly I think genuine empathy is just as valuable as shared experience, because it demonstrates a wider acceptance of the goals you’re trying to achieve. If you only encourage your philosophy within the tight constraints of those whom it will inherently appeal to, you’re not going to change anything. It’s like running an ideological bakery; trying to sell cakes to a cake lover is easy, trying to sell cakes to a diabetic is… well, it’s dangerous, but you catch my drift.</p>
<p>My other reasoning is that, as my crudest understanding of feminism is the pursuit of equal rights, refusing to call men feminists on the basis of their gender is hypocritical, and the very antithesis of equality. Throwing inter-defined phrases like ‘pro-feminist’ or ‘feminist sympathiser’ around creates a ‘them’ and ‘us’ mindset. By resorting to the dissection of semantics, you risk alienating someone who wanted to identify with you &#8211; and you, with a desire for black and white delineation, then reject them. Men already suffer prejudice if they express any distaste for hegemonic masculinity; it’s difficult to publically denounce sexism without being seen as &#8216;girly&#8217; somehow. I think it&#8217;s widely believed that until traditional ideas about masculinity are rewritten so that’s it ‘normal’ to feel sensitivity to violence and rape, feminism will fail to accrue male mass appeal. I’m sure that lots of men don’t give a flying fudge what their peers call them, but ignorance to the implications of old fashioned gender roles for men is unforgivable. Separate sphere-ism is something that still plagues society, for all genders.</p>
<p>I remember reading <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/apr/23/canmenbefeminists">a piece by Cath Elliot</a> a couple of years back which looked at this debate. Her most valuable observation is about fragmentation; she speaks of the need to ideologically confine ourselves to very specific labels which can ultimately lead to the splintering of women’s’ groups. She says that the conflict as to what extent men can be included in feminist activism is just another manifestation of that; another thing that can’t be agreed upon and risks hindering progress. I’m not sure how far I agree with this, but it does raise an interesting point about how feminism treats its supporters. It sometimes looks like the remnants of a Pankhurst vs Fawcett debacle, which neglects to realise that ultimately, we all want the same thing. But I think this is probably the case for lots of groups seeking social reform. The political is personal, and personal politics aren’t easy to share.</p>
<p>It translates into pop culture too. A current example of the divide is exhibited in criticisms of Stieg Larsson. The Hollywood revision of <strong>The Girl With The Dragoon Tattoo</strong> has, yet again, stirred up misgivings about Larsson’s depictions of misogyny in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_series">Millennium Series</a>. I too, feel uncomfortable with the sexed-up sexual violence displayed onscreen, but is it really fair to question the author’s motives? It’s common knowledge that the books were inspired by a childhood trauma, when Larsson witnessed the gang rape of a local girl. And all the evidence suggests that as a consequence, he genuinely abhorred violence against women. He was a socialist activist, founding the <a href="http://expo.se/2010/about-expo_3514.html">Swedish Expo Foundation</a> which sought to expose and end extreme right and white supremacist activity. He was very vocal about his feelings on inequality. So why does it appear so difficult for us to read the message with the spirit in which it was intended? Would we feel the same discomfort towards the franchise if the creator was a woman? If the writing had been female, maybe it would have been viewed as harrowing instead of graphic. But whatever your thoughts on the series, you have to pay credit where credit’s due. Larsson has helped bring misogyny to the forefront of public debate, the volumes have sold 65 million copies worldwide, and the films are huge too. Regardless if it appeals to one’s personal taste, surely the feminist community should embrace the chance to discuss misogyny within a contemporary and popular context?</p>
<p>I suppose for me, my perception of men and feminism is built around my own heroes. My Dad, for one, always instilled a sense of ‘you are not a girl, you’re a person’ in both me and my sister, and that was vital to my understanding of sexism, misogyny and the injustices I felt later on. It’s not because he identifies himself as a feminist, mind &#8211; he has no socio-political interest whatsoever. It was simply that, as his children, he wanted to pass on his interests to us, and the fact that we were girls and some of his pastimes were less than feminine was irrelevant. His biggest passions were music and film, and I owe my love of both to him. I was listening to Dire Straits when most girls my age had little in the way of audio knowledge other than the theme tune to <strong>Rosie and Jim</strong>. He made us have a crack at everything; fishing, sailing, karate. We were taught to use tools. Although I’d like to think my thoughts on egalitarianism are a little more sophisticated than they were as a kid, I do owe my unwavering faith in fundamental parity to the men in my life, as well as the women. So I feel a personal obligation to ensure that men and women are credited and treated fairly.</p>
<p>I do get it. We don’t want to rely on men to make feminism credible &#8211; I suppose the fear is that many thoughtful discussions aren’t &#8216;validated&#8217; until they’re echoed in a male voice, meaning that the content of the message is only getting through via a diluted medium. But to split hairs over whether or not a man calls himself a feminist is flouting the nature of what we’re all about. After all, what’s in a name?</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>We not only have to survive, we have to deserve to survive. </strong><br />
&#8211; Joss Whedon</p></blockquote>
<p>Whedon was talking about how characters make hard decisions in <strong>Battlestar Galactica</strong>, but the same sentiment is reflected in lines from his “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoEZQfTaaEA">Equality Now</a>” speech:</p>
<blockquote><p>Equality is not a concept. It’s not something we should be striving for. It’s a necessity. Equality is like gravity, we need it to stand on this earth as men and women &#8211; and the misogyny that is in every culture is not a true part of the human condition. It is life out of balance, and that imbalance is sucking something out of the soul of every man and woman who’s confronted with it.</p></blockquote>
<p>These two quotes sum up why I’m a feminist. Equality is not optional. I’m intelligent enough, and live in a society educated enough, that there is no excuse for me not to aim for it. Without equality, we fail as human beings.</p>

(Stop complaining about spoilers, you&#39;ve had 40 years.)</p></div>
<p>This type of “equality” is not some iron-clad regulation of behaviour, but an equal chance to live as you choose to: not to be disadvantaged because assumptions are made about one of two categories (which don&#8217;t match the multiple physical or mental possibilities anyway). Not pressured to act a certain way, or locked out from having power over your life. And it&#8217;s not some unimportant dream of abstract perfection but the most fundamental part of the lives of millions.</p>
<p>Reaching this fabled Equality won’t solve many problems. Those people lucky enough to escape poverty will still need to work every day, death is still inevitable, resources are still finite. If we had a much-reduced need for feminism, we’d only be <em>starting</em> on the struggle for a better society &#8211; but we wouldn’t be dooming over half our population to lesser chances and consideration because they don’t have man-parts.</p>
<p>Of course, aiming for true equality and overcoming the prejudices which are deeply ingrained in our (somewhat twisted) upbringings is difficult even for feminists. I wonder whether giving up my seat on the train for a woman is deeply offensive and sexist, because it’s based on the idea that women are weak creatures to be treasured and looked after by big strong men. I start to examine <em>every single decision I make</em> that is based on the line “because she’s a woman”. In a society where equality was real, that reason would virtually never apply.</p>
<p>For most roles, if gender is the only difference between two people then they should be interchangeable. A decision should immediately be about the positives and negatives of the individual instead. By having true equality, you would be free to see the person for who they are – at the very least, THEY would be free to choose who they are without having it dictated because of what society thinks “women” are/deserve this year.</p>
<p>But instead girls still get pink dolls and boys get blue trucks.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not unrealistic to have true equality as the eventual aim. In fact, it makes identifying the current inequality all the easier: endless shelves of women&#8217;s magazines full of airbrushed anorexics, and also full shelves of men&#8217;s mags featuring topless women all with identical body shapes&#8230; if we were surrounded by constant images of perfectly-toned half naked men with impossible airbrushed bodies on every second billboard and magazine cover instead, you have to wonder how long this shit would last.</p>
<p>Mark Thomas (the political comedian) released a &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_People%27s_Manifesto"><strong>People&#8217;s Manifesto</strong></a>&#8221; earlier this year. It was made by his audiences volunteering their ideas for new British laws. My favourite reads:<em>&#8220;Models to be selected at random from the electoral register&#8221;.</em></p>
<p>Male, female, young, old. Large, small. All races, all shoes sizes, glasses-wearing NORMAL PEOPLE modelling clothes for normal people.</p>
<p>Of course, his show is supposed to be a comedy.</p>
<p>Going this far into the idea of a culture where we truly don’t dictate gender roles is not Joss Whedon’s point at all, and not really my main one either. We’re not there. We’re not even 10% of the way there. We’re in a world where we still have to campaign to stop female genital mutilation <em>in England</em>. Where large parts of the planet treat over 50% of human beings as property, or as unclean, dangerous sexual objects.</p>

<p>The term &#8216;Feminism&#8217; has a bad rep with a lot of men. When I linked to this site from my blog, one of the commenters said they found the idea of male feminists &#8220;somewhat absurd&#8221;. That&#8217;s light compared to the reception they receive in some places online.</p>
<p><strong>Bad Rep </strong>believes that we&#8217;re not going to make much change by refusing to engage with 49% of the population on principle, so this last bit is aimed at male readers:</p>
<p>Men! Do not be afraid! Not only are you welcome here, but you probably already agree with everything feminism stands for:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>A feminist is a person who answers &#8220;yes&#8221; to the question, &#8220;Are women human?&#8221;</strong> Feminism is not about whether women are better than, worse than or identical with men. &#8230; It&#8217;s about women having intrinsic value as persons rather than contingent value as a means to an end for others: fetuses, children, the &#8220;family,&#8221; men.<br />
&#8211; Katha Pollitt</p></blockquote>
<p>Or more succinctly:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Feminism is the radical notion that women are people.</strong><br />
&#8211; Cheris Kramarae, Paula A. Treichler, Ann Russo: <strong>A Feminist Dictionary</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Equality is not optional. It is the only way we can get to the very first step of the ladder that creates a society to be proud of, and leave a record of the human race which doesn’t mark us as worse than the apes we came from. It&#8217;s not &#8216;absurd&#8217; to have everyone involved &#8211; men <em>need</em> female equality to be in place before we can truthfully call ourselves men.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a bit of wishful thinking really, but I was inspired by a conversation with my own father after I&#8217;d told him I was writing for this website.</p>
<p>&#8220;Feminism? Does that mean you hate men now?&#8221; My father is a master of both dry wit and directness, you can&#8217;t foil him with flannel, so what I say next can&#8217;t be fluffy or theory-wanking.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s more about equality.&#8221; At this point I have to pause, because realistically my dad does not need to know the entire history of the feminist movement over tea and scones at the South Bank. He is taking an interest in my interests. Which means I should at least have the grace to be interesting.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve theoretically got legal equality, but there&#8217;s still a lot of inequality in society. A lack of respect for women as people&#8230;&#8221; He&#8217;s still got his eyes open and therefore so far, so good. &#8220;Like when men call out to women on the streets if they are wearing dresses. Makes me feel uncomfortable to wear a dress, and that&#8217;s not on.&#8221;</p>
<p>I can tell that I&#8217;ve got him right there. He starts to tell me about a time he was out with my brother and two men were &#8220;effing and blinding&#8221; (my father rarely swears) at a young woman across the street.</p>
<p>&#8220;I might read up on this, on the internet, when I get home to your mum.&#8221;</p>
<p>We return to our cups of tea, but internally, ideas are brewing.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Erika___Tony__s_Visit_007a.jpg?resize=353%2C470" alt="" width="353" height="470" data-recalc-dims="1" />Why aren&#8217;t more fathers involved in the feminist movement? On the surface, it seems an obvious partnership. Surely no father would want his daughter to grow up in a world where she had less respect, less equality and less room to succeed than her brothers? Yet the link between &#8220;feminism&#8221; and &#8220;making life better for your daughter&#8221; seems to be feeble to the point of invisibility. Instead, there is a jump to the fear of the unfamiliar, the media-generated whispers of what evil feminists are like &#8211; man-haters to quote my dad, who is neither a sexist nor easily swayed by the opinions of the papers. He was just recounting what he understood the term to mean.</p>
<p>I want to take a little time to unpick the relationship between feminism and fatherhood, with the hope of encouraging more people to think about feminism in a more positive light, to give them the tools to talk to their parents about feminism, and to (finally) get our dads on board.</p>
<p>There is a lot of prejudice surrounding feminism and the family. This can range from the (in)famous Pat Robinson quote that &#8220;feminism is a socialist, anti-family, political movement that encourages women to leave their husbands, kill their children, practice witchcraft, destroy capitalism and become lesbians&#8221; to the somewhat outre thinking (not to mention strange definitions) of a <a href="http://www.fathermag.com/902/feminism/">divorce campaigner in America</a>. A quick google for references to &#8220;feminism and the family&#8221; or &#8220;fathers and feminism&#8221; reveals heartbreaking commonalities mostly centered around the idea that the feminist movement is somehow trying to extract men from the entire family process.</p>
<p>You can see how a wrong-headed reading of women&#8217;s rights might have picked up that impression. The longstanding assumption that an increase in freedom for women must naturally lead to a decrease in freedom for men (as if there were only a certain amount of freedom in the world). Changes in legislation over the past eighty years or so, from the vote, through to divorce laws, inheritance, mortgage rights (yesterday I was talking to a lady who told me when she was my age women couldn&#8217;t apply for a mortgage by herself) and so on have all enabled women to move from being reliant on men to being more self-reliant. However, this move is all too often read as a move<em> away from</em> men rather than being a move toward <em>engaging with</em> men on equal, independent terms.</p>
<p>The stock figures often quoted as examples of how feminism is destroying the family unit are the rising divorce rate. Personally I take issue with the idea that relationship status is indicative of a strong family unit &#8211; I would much rather that parents were happy with each other and unwed than unhappily married. However, that aside it&#8217;s important to note that  it is almost impossible to gauge what, if any, influence feminism has had on these numbers. Frankly, if feminists could somehow cause such vast social change, then it&#8217;s unclear why we still have such crappy rape prevention or why little girls are forever dressed in pink. More is at issue here &#8211; starting with the lessening of religious influence in our daily lives (if marriage is not a sacrament, then divorce is no longer a sin), the decline in different social status for married versus unmarried people (there is less incentive to remain within an unhappy marriage) and the lowering stigma of the single parent (although I would argue that single mums are still pilloried by society whilst single dads put on pedestals, but that&#8217;s another article). This is social change, perhaps influenced in part by feminism, but just as equally influenced by all the changes that have occured in the last century. The world has changed.</p>
<p>It is easy to sneer at those who think that feminism is damaging to the family.</p>
<p>But before we sneer, we must understand what we are looking at. The truth is that what feminism wants <em>is deeply challenging</em> to a traditionalist and parts of what feminism is hoping to achieve can also be somewhat difficult to swallow by almost anyone raised in the modern UK: it involves a complete step change in our understanding of the family unit which has massive knock-on effects in most areas of society &#8211; work, education, retirement, marriage and relationships. If we wanted a truly equal setting for the family, in which neither gender is assumed to have a &#8220;natural&#8221; role in parenting &#8211; and I think we do &#8211; then all of these things must change both in theory and practice.  And that is mindblowing. Here&#8217;s how: try and think about it. Picture, in your mind, if you can (and I find it quite hard), a world in which mums and dads are given exactly the same weight and priority by society. Have exactly the same expectations placed upon them. Are communicated to by the media and advertising in the same fashion.</p>
<p>In other words, that parents are treated as parents, rather than isolated and grouped according to gender. And we aren&#8217;t surprised by it. Dads change nappies. Mums go out to work. Dads do the dishes. Mums do the school run. Parents Evening is exactly that. There&#8217;s no assumption or hierarchy in who might be better at doing what beyond what each individual is able and willing to do. People with ovaries teach children to throw and kick balls in the playground. People with Y chromosomes make chocolate crispy cakes (and mostly mess) in the kitchen. Maternity and paternity leave cease to exist and we have parental leave. No-one bats an eyelid.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a strange place, isn&#8217;t it? But wonderful.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s a place I think we can get to, if we try to break down the barriers that exist between perceptions of what feminism could really mean to fatherhood.</p>
<p>In the UK there are a number of dad centered internet institutions (nowhere near as many as for mothers &#8211; <a href="http://www.mumsnet.com/info/aboutus">mumsnet</a>, for example, is  a huge and generally positive and useful resource, but despite the claims to be &#8220;by parents for parents&#8221; is still in name and deed more focused on women than men). These include <a href="http://www.fathers-4-justice.org/">Fathers 4 Justice</a> and other similarly named organisations that fight for changes in family law, including the website <a href="http://www.dads-uk.co.uk/main/news.php">Dads UK </a>which again focuses on access, divorce and children. As far as I&#8217;m aware, neither of these organisations have strong links to UK feminists, and in some cases a scan of their pages reveals the same sort of prejudices that are repeated over and over and over again &#8211; that the feminist movement took their children away. It&#8217;s a little bit like 21st century witchhunting. Scapegoating is easier than finding the real solution &#8211; especially when the real solution involves complicated individuals and their lives rather than a nice easy public target.</p>
<p>So how do we change this for the better?</p>

</strong>&#8211;<a href="http://www.zoemargolis.co.uk/">Zoe Margolis</a>, reviewing <a href="http://www.thefword.org.uk/">Cath Redfern&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Reclaiming-Word-New-Feminist-Movement/dp/1848133952">Reclaiming the F Word</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Hi there, internet!  This is a feminist blog-</p>
<p>Quit gurning at the back already. EYES FRONT, PEOPLE. Just for a moment.</p>
<p>This is a feminist blog.</p>
<p>Feminism has a bad old rep at the moment. My search results for the word, as I write this, are a predictable molotov of very established feminist sites and an obligatory dollop of &#8220;this stuff destroys homes&#8221;-type bile.  So far, so expected.</p>
<p>But increasingly, there&#8217;s a lot of mainstream cringing about the f-word going on, with words like &#8220;irrelevant&#8221;, &#8220;exclusive&#8221; and &#8220;outdated&#8221; on constant rotation.  Call yourself a feminist in conversation, and you will very likely be handed the Invisible Awkward Balloon.</p>
<p>You know what I&#8217;m talking about.  Suddenly everyone&#8217;s looking at you funny. They&#8217;ve decided you&#8217;re &#8220;a bit quirky&#8221;. You have to hold the Awkward Balloon for the rest of the conversation. No matter what you do, it will not just float away. You think, &#8220;Ack. I am <em>so</em> not mentioning this aspect of my socio-political views out loud ever again&#8221;.  Sad times, people.</p>

<p><strong>That Whole Knotty &#8216;What Is Feminism Anyway&#8217; Business<br />
</strong></p>
<p>For us, putting it simply, feminism is the recognition that in many areas both close to home and internationally, women and men do not receive equal rights and privileges.  It goes further than that, too &#8211; it&#8217;s the stance of owning the opinion that this should change for the better, and <em>not</em> in a way in which one gender supercedes another, whatever the &#8220;fem&#8221; bit at the beginning might imply. A great deal of progress has been made with this in many countries, but the fact remains that attitudes change slowly, even after legislation has been passed.</p>
<h3>The Dreaded F-Word, You Say?</h3>
<p>There are a lot of people out there who would support the above stance.  But they&#8217;re wary of using the dreaded f-word, or of connecting with people who use  it.  Some of them, however it happened &#8211; and we&#8217;re not bothered about blaming anybody &#8211;  seem to have ended up feeling that their activism might not be welcome if they did either of these things.  We think this is a shame.</p>
<h3>Ladies And Gentlemen And Everybody Else</h3>
<p>The six individuals who make up this blog at the time of writing &#8211; and we are a mixed-gender group &#8211;  are friends. We didn&#8217;t meet through feminism, though we have it in common as a label we agree works well. This blog is our shared platform &#8211; and we don&#8217;t always agree with each other, either. Sometimes we&#8217;re angry, but we also have a sense of humour. We&#8217;re all featured briefly on <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/about/">our About page</a>, but we hope that we&#8217;ll emerge, over time, as distinct voices.</p>
<p>Our strapline is <strong><em>a feminist pop culture adventure</em></strong>.  We&#8217;re named after a <a href="http://www.joanjett.com/index.html">Joan Jett</a> song for a reason &#8211; we want to be a good first route in for people just starting to become interested in feminist and gender-related issues, and we also want to reclaim some of the inspiring, rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll energy that characterised the feminist movement in previous generations. (Also, c&#8217;mon. Joan Jett is freaking badass.)</p>

Kinda like we want to. We named our site after Bad Reputation for a reason... </p></div>
<p><strong>Angry All The Time?</strong></p>
<p>This site is about looking for <strong>positives </strong>as much as shouting out a problem &#8211; if we don&#8217;t like something, we&#8217;ll  try and point at something else we think does get it right, or something that <strong>you</strong>, at grassroots level, can do about it.  We&#8217;re about <strong>simple, practical activism.</strong></p>
<p>So it&#8217;s not all anger and humourless ranting, though anger rightly has its place as long as there&#8217;s still <a href="http://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/index.asp?PageID=321">a gender gap</a>.</p>
<p>But it is about <em>moving</em>, about thinking about what&#8217;s going on around you, every day, and pushing &#8211; even in small ways &#8211;  for change.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s about enjoying how far we have come, acknowledging the good stuff, and connecting with people who feel the same.</p>
<h3>Let&#8217;s Go!</h3>
<p>A movement is defined by who&#8217;s on board. It is what you make it. We like this bandwagon fine. It may have a Bad Rep, but we&#8217;re okay with that. It&#8217;s our bandwagon, too. It&#8217;s achieved good things, and we believe it isn&#8217;t done yet.</p>
<p>Welcome aboard.</p>
