					<description><![CDATA[It's hard to find a way to re-appropriate any of these ideas in a positive way. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Hodge-note:</strong> This rather special item from the archives was originally #22 in the <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/category/alphabet/" target="_blank">Alphabet series</a>, and got mostly written (and illustrated) before I heard the siren song of <strong>vitriol</strong> instead, with its rich murder and rage connotations. <a title="V is for Vitriol" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/03/21/an-alphabet-of-feminism-22-v-is-for-vitriol/" target="_blank"><strong>Vitriol</strong></a> was duly inducted into the Alphabet official rankings and <strong>Virgin</strong> languished like a vestal until we thought maybe she should see the light of day&#8230;</p>
<p>Here she is:</p>
<h6 style="text-align: center;">V</h6>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">VIRGIN</h2>
<blockquote><p>And your quaint honour turn to dust<br />
And into ashes all my lust&#8230;</p>
<p>Andrew Marvell, <strong>To His Coy Mistress </strong>c.1640s</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Virgin</em> has a comparatively straightforward etymology: it derives from the Latin <em>virgo </em>(= &#8216;maiden&#8217;), whence the star-sign Virgo (apparently the sign of the shy, modest and meticulous, with a dash of perfectionism and anxiety). Its first sense (c.1200) is an ecclesiastical one: &#8216;an unmarried or chaste maiden or women, distinguished for piety or steadfastness in religion, and regarded as having a special place among the members of the Christian church on account of these merits.&#8217;</p>
<h2>Like a virgin</h2>
<div id="attachment_13600" style="width: 189px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/saint-lucy.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13600" data-attachment-id="13600" data-permalink="/2013/06/03/v-is-for-virgin-alphabet-b-sides-and-rarities/saint-lucy/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/saint-lucy.jpg?fit=415%2C599&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="415,599" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Saint Lucy, 1521" data-image-description="&lt;p&gt;Saint Lucy, with her eyes, as depicted in 1521&lt;/p&gt;
" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/saint-lucy.jpg?fit=208%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/saint-lucy.jpg?fit=415%2C599&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-13600   " alt="Saint Lucy, with her eyes, as depicted in 1521" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/saint-lucy.jpg?resize=179%2C258" width="179" height="258" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-13600" class="wp-caption-text">Saint Lucy, with her eyes, as depicted in 1521</p></div>
<p>There are innumerable such virgins in Christian hagiography: Saint Ursula had an army of 11,000 virgin handmaids who all had their heads chopped off (in a bit of a pun-fail); Saint Cecilia (patron saint of music) managed not only to persuade her husband to forbear on their wedding night, but also to join the Christian cause along with his brother, and suffer death in consequence.</p>
<p>Saint Lucy consecrated her virginity to God, and, supposedly, tore her own eyes out and gave them to her husband (who had admired them) as a kind of macabre substitute for the marital debt. (Lesson: never admire your girlfriend&#8217;s essential organs).</p>
<p>And, of course, there is the arch-virgin much mentioned in these posts – the eponymous Mary, who gets a definition all to herself as <em>virgin</em>&#8216;s fourth meaning.</p>
<p>Mary&#8217;s particular achievement &#8211; the Virgin Birth &#8211; is also considered of some importance in these definitions for <em>virgin</em>. It presumably lies behind the gloss &#8216;a female insect producing fertile <a title="O is for Ovary" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/01/24/an-alphabet-of-femininism-15-o-is-for-ovary/" target="_blank">eggs</a> by pathenogenesis [without the input of a male insect]&#8217; (1883), as well as <em>virgin</em>&#8216;s simple equivalence with &#8216;pathenogenesis&#8217; itself (1849) &#8211; a word with its origin in the Greek <em>parthenos</em>, also meaning &#8216;virgin&#8217; and &#8216;genesis&#8217; (= &#8216;creation&#8217;).</p>
<p>This &#8211; reproduction without fertilisation &#8211; though clearly associated with Mary in Christian tradition, is also arguably the origin of Adam, so it doesn&#8217;t have to be have an explicit cultural gender-association. Indeed, there is a Middle English citation for <em>virgin </em>that defines it as <span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">&#8216;a youth or man who has remained in a state of chastity&#8217;. But this is admittedly an unusual example among the definitions as a whole. </span></p>
<h2>A woman&#8217;s touch</h2>
<div id="attachment_13599" style="width: 207px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/vestal.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13599" data-attachment-id="13599" data-permalink="/2013/06/03/v-is-for-virgin-alphabet-b-sides-and-rarities/vestal/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/vestal.jpg?fit=246%2C388&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="246,388" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Roman depiction of a vestal virgin" data-image-description="&lt;p&gt;Roman depiction of a vestal virgin&lt;/p&gt;
" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/vestal.jpg?fit=190%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/vestal.jpg?fit=246%2C388&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-13599 " alt="Roman depiction of a vestal virgin" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/vestal.jpg?resize=197%2C310" width="197" height="310" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-13599" class="wp-caption-text">A Vestal Virgin</p></div>
<p>If we go back to ancient Rome, we meet another sense the religious meaning of <em>virgin</em> can have: the very non-Christian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestal_Virgin" target="_blank">Vestal Virgins</a>, a group of highly respected women whose job it was to guard the &#8216;sacred fire&#8217; and take care of the rituals and responsibilities that could not be dealt with by male priests.</p>
<p>They were so named because their duties were primarily to Vesta, the Roman goddess of the hearth and family, and, in consequence, the Vestal Virgins took on a role as kind of symbolic housewives to the whole of Rome.</p>
<p>Though they would be obliged to remain <em>virginal </em>throughout their time as priestesses, in the word&#8217;s second sense &#8216;a woman who is or remains in a state of inviolate chastity&#8217;, the vow only lasted thirty years, at the end of which they were free to marry (though most of them seem not to have been all that bothered).</p>
<p>This all said, while these saints and priestesses are all very much <em>virgins </em>in the most common sense of the word, the ecclesiastical meaning does not have to imply the sexual inexperience they normally connote, since &#8216;chastity&#8217; simply means &#8216;clean, pure&#8217; (from the Latin <em>castus</em>), and has no intrinsic connection with physical &#8216;intactness&#8217;, though it is frequently used as a synonym. In fact, the fourth definition for the second primary meaning of the word (where it can be used to describe things other than women) highlights &#8216;purity or freedom from stain&#8217; and being &#8216;unsullied&#8217;.</p>
<p>If you cast your mind back to &#8216;<a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/01/10/an-alphabet-of-femininism-13-m-is-for-marriage/" target="_blank">M is for Marriage</a>&#8216;, you may remember that <em>adultery </em>means &#8216;pollution of the marriage bed&#8217;, suggesting by association that the marriage bed was a sacred – or indeed &#8216;pure&#8217; – space. And indeed, marriage was widely considered invalid without consummation – something Henry VIII made much use of in his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_of_Cleves#A_doomed_marriage" target="_blank">royal divorces </a>– and, in consequence, the virtuous wife who dexterously trod the balance of Pure Marital Sex and Pollution of the Marriage Bed (whether by adultery as we conceive it, or by lusting after her husband) could be as much feted as the unmarried <em>virgin </em>(indeed, more so, if she proved herself skilled in housewifery and produced equally virtuous children).</p>

<p>That said, a curious and related term first cited in 1644 was <em>virgin widow</em>, meaning a woman whose husband had died before the marriage could be consummated, and whose status was therefore ambiguously poised between <em>virginity </em>(in the sense of being unmarried) and <a title="W is for Widow" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/03/28/an-alphabet-of-feminism-23-w-is-for-widow/" target="_blank"><em>widowhood </em></a>(being left behind after the death of a husband).</p>
<p>This was <a title="LRB Catherine of Aragon" href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v33/n15/eamon-duffy/the-unlikeliest-loophole" target="_blank">Catherine of Aragon</a>&#8216;s position, as argued at her divorce hearing, during the painful period  after Prince Arthur&#8217;s death &#8211; languishing in a political and social limbo, waiting for something to happen, steadily running out of money and losing points on the marriage market.</p>
<h2>Purity is a virtue of the soul</h2>
<p>An excellent, though somewhat horrific, example of the noble wife trope is <a title="Lucretia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucretia" target="_blank">Lucretia</a>, the virtuous spouse of Collatine, whose rape by the royal prince Tarquin so outraged Rome that it led directly to the establishment of the Roman republic. As a wife, Lucretia is not a technical <em>virgin</em>, but she is (as Shakespeare puts it in the oft-forgotten early poem <strong>The</strong> <strong>Rape of Lucrece </strong>(1594)) &#8216;Collatine&#8217;s fair love, Lucrece the <em>chaste</em>&#8216;.</p>
<p>Saint <a title="Augustine" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo" target="_blank">Augustine</a> posits that &#8216;<a title="Augustine" href="http://faculty.washington.edu/miceal/lgw/lucretia/Augustine.html" target="_blank">purity is a virtue of the soul</a>&#8216;, and since body and soul are (in this reading) distinct, Lucrece can consummate her marriage while still retaining her essential &#8216;bodily sanctity&#8217; because she is free of polluting lust in the process.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Unfortunately, Collatine spends so much time bragging about his wife&#8217;s chastity to the bros in the camp that he invites trouble:</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Haply that name of &#8220;chaste&#8221; unhapp&#8217;ly set<br />
The bateless edge on [Tarquin&#8217;s] appetite</p>
<p>Shakespeare, <strong>The Rape of Lucrece</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Lucretia is so traumatised by Tarquin&#8217;s subsequent rape that she stabs herself rather than &#8216;live impure&#8217;, widely considered by the (male) world to be a Noble Decision. This led to her immortalisation in literature and philosophy as a perfect wife, but also prompted Augustine to engage in some terrible rape apologism in the service of his broader argument (</span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">&#8216;If she was adulterous, why praise her? if chaste, why slay her?&#8217;).</span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><br />
</span></p>
<h2>Saints and sieves</h2>
<p>It is presumably a version of this chastity-of-the-soul idea so beloved by Augustine that lies behind the story of Tuccia, the Vestal Virgin who proves her virginity by carrying water from the Tiber in a sieve without spilling a drop (<a title="Tuccia" href="http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/upload/img/moroni-vestal-virgin-tuccia-NG3123-fm.jpg" target="_blank">here she is </a>depicted in 1555 with the sieve itself, and wearing an outfit that leaves little to the imagination, chaste or otherwise).</p>
<p>I suppose the idea behind the sieve story is that something that would normally flow through the porous surface is maintained &#8216;intact&#8217;, perhaps representing the pure soul within a porous body. At any rate, it became a key symbol of virginity, most notably in the &#8216;Sieve Portrait&#8217; of the &#8216;<a title="Q is for Queen" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/02/07/an-alphabet-of-femininism-17-q-is-for-queen/" target="_blank">Virgin Queen</a>&#8216; Elizabeth I, who is also cited in the Dictionary as a definition of <i>virgin </i>in herself.</p>
<p>The last citation given in the dictionary for <em>virgin</em>, with which we will end, is from 1780, as &#8216;a fortress or city that has never been taken or subdued&#8217;. This has an obvious resonance with Lucrece, and the ultimately martial tale her story becomes &#8211; another link between feminine &#8216;closedness&#8217; and men&#8217;s military convenience.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to find a way to re-appropriate any of these ideas in a positive way. But maybe this transferred definition or fortresses and cities should make us think about Elizabeth I, who at least made them work to her own military and political advantage.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[If you remember the Alphabet of Feminism, this one's for you. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Ed&#8217;s note:</strong> In the original Alphabet we did <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/10/18/an-alphabet-of-femininism-3-c-is-for-crinoline/" target="_blank">&#8216;C is for Crinoline&#8217;</a> &#8211; but here&#8217;s something we thought was topically worth coming back to.</p>
<h6 style="text-align: center;">C</h6>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">CHIVALRY</h2>
<blockquote><p>Chivalry is dead, but you&#8217;re still kinda cute.</p>
<p>&#8211; Nelly Furtado, <strong>Promiscuous</strong> (2006)</p></blockquote>
<p>Chivalry. Not one of feminism&#8217;s most pressing issues, but definitely one of its more genteel <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/01/25/keep-the-gift-pay-what-you-owe/" target="_blank">debates</a>.</p>
<p>Do you, as an attractive female who also happens to be a feminist, deign to take the seat that dude offers you on the crowded tube or laugh hollowly and stick your head back in your neighbour&#8217;s armpit? Is chivalry OK?</p>
<p>Personally, my view on this debate is always affected by the point that 99% of the men I&#8217;ve met who talk about chivalry with misty-eyed fervour are also the kind of Nice Guys who Really Aren&#8217;t Very Nice At All.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not for here.</p>
<p>What I am interested in is looking at its complex linguistic heritage.</p>
<h2>Horses</h2>
<p>What&#8217;s that sound in the distance?</p>
<p>Why, it&#8217;s the sound of clopping hooves &#8211; and<em> chivalry</em>&#8216;s etymological root come to join us. Neiiigh.</p>

<p>For though <em>chivalry<strong> </strong></em>in English means (first definition ahoy!)  &#8216;the code of behaviour demonstrated<em> by a perfect knight</em>&#8216;, were we French we&#8217;d replace &#8216;knight&#8217; with &#8216;<em>chevalier</em>&#8216;, or &#8216;horseman&#8217; &#8211; from the root word <em>cheval</em> (= &#8216;horse&#8217;).</p>
<p>The knight, or <em>chevalier</em>, is <em> </em>in origin a nobleman on horseback who goes around rescuing maidens and fighting dragons. He is <em>chivalrous </em>in behaviour, displaying (the word&#8217;s second definition) &#8216;courage, honour, justice and readiness to help the weak&#8217;.</p>
<p>Key examples can be found in the legends of King Arthur and his horsebacked Knights of the Round Table &#8211; in particular Sir Gawain and the so-good-he-couldn&#8217;t-be-gooder Sir Percival (who later becomes Wagner&#8217;s <strong>Parsifal</strong>).</p>
<p>The chivalrous are those on horseback.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s the secondary meaning of <em>chivalry</em> that we best recognise today: &#8216;<em>courteous</em> behaviour, especially towards women&#8217; (that is, giving up your seat on the tube, which Percival would totally have done if he didn&#8217;t travel everywhere by <em>cheval</em>).<em> </em></p>
<h2>Courtly-powered lovin&#8217;</h2>
<p>Chivalry &#8211; and the <em>courtesy </em>that defines it &#8211; is also the base idea behind <em>courtly</em> <em>love</em>, which the devoted may remember we addressed separately in the <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/12/20/an-alphabet-of-femininism-12-l-is-for-lady/" target="_blank">Alphabet Glory Days</a>.</p>

<p>This is what the knights are doing when they&#8217;re not out fighting &#8211;  sighing for love among rose bushes, swooning at the touch of a <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/11/01/an-alphabet-of-femininism-5-e-is-for-emancipate/" target="_blank">&#8216;lily-white hand&#8217;</a> and <em>definitely </em>giving up their seats for a woman on the medieval commute.</p>
<p>And it was said to have been invented by a woman, Eleanor of Aquitaine.</p>
<p>Before she married Henry II and brought her French customs over to England, Eleanor had a period presiding alone over a predominantly male grouping in Poitiers.It seems inventing an elaborate code of chaste devotion to a single lady &#8211; <em>court</em>eous behaviour, if you will &#8211; was a good way for Eleanor to bring these bored and potentially restless knights into order &#8211; and, I assume, to block potential sexual aggression at the same time (cf. the court of Elizabeth I, which saw a resurgence of &#8216;courtly&#8217; devotion to &#8216;Gloriana&#8217;, the &#8216;Virgin <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/02/07/an-alphabet-of-femininism-17-q-is-for-queen/" target="_blank">Queen</a>&#8216;).</p>
<h2>Courtship</h2>
<p>With these courtly roots, it&#8217;s appropriate that, during the English Civil War, the word <em>chevalier </em>should lend itself so enthusiastically to the Royalist cause in fighting for king (and court).</p>
<p>In this context, the Cavaliers were enemies to the Roundheads and cousins to <em>chevaliers</em> via the Latin source-word &#8216;cabellarius&#8217; (also meaning &#8216;horseman&#8217;).</p>
<p>The origin of this term is actually pre-war, in the grouping of courtly &#8216;cavaliers&#8217; at the original Carolingian court (a bit like the courtly lovers at Poitiers).</p>
<p>These included the &#8216;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavalier_poet" target="_blank">Cavalier poets</a>&#8216;, a conglomerate of literary courtiers formed by the King himself, including Robert Herrick and Edmund Waller.</p>
<p>The term in this usage is ambiguous, though. On the one hand, <em>cavalier</em> was often used in allusion to the King&#8217;s refined (indeed &#8216;knightly&#8217;) sensibilities, which, incidentally, included a famous love of horses &#8211; as the many magnificent equestrian portraits of him attest.</p>
<p>But, in a pejorative sense, the <em>cavalier poets </em>were so named because they were famously &#8216;roistering gallants&#8217; and &#8216;libertines&#8217;. This is <em>cavalier</em>&#8216;s other meaning: &#8216;haughty, disdainful or supercilious&#8217; or &#8216;offhand and unceremonious&#8217; (a bit like wearing your hat at a<a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/02/14/an-alphabet-of-femininism-18-r-is-for-rake/" target="_blank"> &#8216;rakish&#8217; angle</a>).</p>
<p>So <em>cavalier </em>is almost a contraction in terms.</p>
<h2>The Don</h2>
<p>This is the very ambiguity we find in Mozart&#8217;s great libertine opera, <strong>Don Giovanni</strong>, written about 100 years later. The &#8216;Don&#8217; is a nobleman and serial womaniser. He&#8217;s a standard-issue<a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/02/14/an-alphabet-of-femininism-18-r-is-for-rake/" target="_blank"> rake</a>, in fact: we learn in the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fccdGBi9JUs&amp;t=2m30s" target="_blank">Catalogue Song</a> that he&#8217;s seduced 1,003 women in Spain alone.</p>

<p>He is throughout referred to in the Italian as a &#8216;cavalier&#8217;, understood (and, for us English-speakers, translated) according to context variously as &#8216;gentleman&#8217; (nobleman on horseback) and &#8216;rake&#8217; (careless womaniser) &#8211; as in the opera&#8217;s subtitle, &#8216;Il <em>dissoluto</em> punito&#8217; (&#8216;the debauchee punished&#8217;).</p>
<p>Thus, when Don Giovanni takes the pretty peasant girl Zerlina away from her finance, Masetto, to show her his castle (no, really), Don Giovanni &#8216;reassures&#8217; the jealous Masetto by saying he needn&#8217;t worry &#8211; his fiancee is &#8216;in the hands of a <em>cavalier</em>&#8216;.Unfortunately, that&#8217;s exactly what Masetto is afraid of. &#8220;Let the<em> cavaliere </em>make a <em>cavaliera</em> out of you!&#8221; he trumpets at the departing Zerlina &#8211; he knows what&#8217;s going down (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q40a23gfxZE" target="_blank">this</a>).</p>
<h2>Court to City</h2>
<p>Back to English climes.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the eighteenth century, Queen Anne halved the size of the English court and moved it out of central London.</p>
<p>In so doing, she ultimately ended up transferring power from court to city &#8211; and <em>courtesy </em>became <em></em>civility (from the Latin <em>cives</em> (= the city)).</p>

<p>This is the age of opening doors, watching your language and standing up when a woman enters the room. Chivalry has gone domestic; men are <em>civil </em>now in Britain. Only the hot-headed Italian Don Giovannis are still <em>cavaliers</em>.</p>
<p>But when Samuel Richardson wanted to depict a perfect (but domestic) Englishman, he still made him an aristocratic knight (<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sir</span> Charles Grandison</strong>). Jane Austen did too: her paragon of virtue (himself based on Sir Charles), is pointedly named Mr <em>Knightly</em> (<strong>Emma</strong>).By this point it&#8217;s faded away to a name rather than a title, but the gentleman still has a vestigial horse (if you will).</p>
<h2>White Knights</h2>
<p>Strangely enough, the vestigial horse becomes more literal in the modern age, in the form of the ladies&#8217; proverbial &#8216;ideal man&#8217; &#8211; a chivalrous gentleman. Mr Right is also a &#8216;knight in shining armour&#8217;.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s even a  Lewis Carroll-esque &#8216;White Knight&#8217;, a noble rescuer (as in the song &#8216;My White Knight&#8217; from Meredith Wilson&#8217;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_oyzwsJOhU" target="_blank"><strong>The Music Man</strong></a>, where the knight in question will, her mother thinks, &#8216;save&#8217; Marian the Librarian from Old Maidery).</p>
<p>Remember when Grace first meets Leo &#8211; the Great Romance &#8211; in <strong>Will and Grace</strong>? He&#8217;s on a horse in Central Park. That&#8217;s how you know he&#8217;s a Big Deal Romance.</p>
<h2>Never trust a man on horseback</h2>
<p>And, to conclude very crudely, I suppose this is what happened to <em>chivalry </em>.</p>
<p>It became the polite behaviour of the  gentleman &#8211; enshrined in tradition and developed over a couple of hundred years to become our friend offering me a seat on the bustling 21st century commute<strong> </strong>and sitcom single girls dreaming of their &#8216;Mr Darcy&#8217;.</p>
<p>But I still hear the sound of clopping hooves. The fantasy may be more Sir Gawain than Don Giovanni, but you know what they say &#8211; the apple never falls far from the lexical tree.</p>

<p>Ahem. <em>Yes </em>is the last of our Old English words. It&#8217;s <em>gise </em>or <em>gese, </em>meaning &#8216;so be it&#8217;, perhaps from <em>gea, ge </em>(= &#8216;so&#8217;), plus <em>si</em> (=&#8217;be it!&#8217;), the third person imperative of <em>beon</em> (= &#8216;to be&#8217;). In this form, <em>yes</em> was stronger than its Germanic cognate, <em>yea </em>(much like today) and, apparently, was often used in Shakespeare as an answer to negative questions. We could do with one of them nowadays, no? How many times have you answered a question with <em>yes </em>when you mean <em>no</em>? (&#8216;Doesn&#8217;t she&#8230;.?&#8217; &#8216;&#8230;Yes, she doesn&#8217;t&#8217;).</p>
<p>The penultimate word in our Alphabet, <em>yes </em>is frequently one of the first words we learn on earth; its meaning is clear and unequivocal, by turns disastrous, passionate, exhilarating, loaded and humdrum &#8211; but always positive in the full sense of that word. It is almost invariably repeated, as in Joyce (and Usher) &#8211; &#8216;yes I will, Yes&#8217;, the successive affirmations underlining and confirming the first &#8211; just like a <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=W7eLlRE-5OwC&amp;pg=PA253&amp;lpg=PA253&amp;dq=ulysses+gramophone+hear+say+yes+in+joyce&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OCKYHR7yyY&amp;sig=Y5Za4Hwk3Sfp2sFGKGxS0xR5Nfw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=9MbzTNvyEOCAhAfmrJCLDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=ulysses%20gramophone%20hear%20say%20yes%20in%20joyce&amp;f=false">signature</a> under your printed name, if you listen to Derrida</p>
<h3>Sure &#8216;Nuff n&#8217; Yes I Do</h3>
<p>James &#8216;<a href="http://www.bedeutung.co.uk/theblog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/james_joyce.jpg">Awesome Glasses</a>&#8216; Joyce apparently made much of his novel &#8216;novel&#8217; <strong>Ulysses</strong> ending on this, which he considered &#8216;the female word&#8217;. The final chapter, &#8216;Penelope&#8217;, often also referred to as &#8216;Molly Bloom&#8217;s soliloquy&#8217;, is 42 pages of just eight sentences, wherein Molly, wife of Leopold Bloom, muses to herself in bed.</p>
<p>For those who have better things to do than wrestle with a modernist doorstop, as the wife of the novel&#8217;s &#8216;Ulysses&#8217;, Molly is a counterpart to &#8216;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penelope">Penelope</a>&#8216;, wife of Odysseus / Ulysses and conventional model of <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/03/28/an-alphabet-of-feminism-23-w-is-for-widow/">marital fidelity</a>. The similarity expires fairly quickly, since Joyce&#8217;s Penelope is having an affair with &#8216;Blazes Boylan&#8217;, but nonetheless her chapter is often named after Ulysses&#8217; wife. It begins and ends with this <em>yes</em>, and in a letter to Frank Budgen, Joyce explained that &#8216;Penelope&#8217; rotates around what he considered the four cardinal points of the female  body &#8211; &#8216;breasts, arse, womb and cunt&#8217; &#8211; expressed respectively by the words <em>because, bottom, woman</em> and <em>yes</em>. Some of the comparisons are clear – the <em><a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/03/14/an-alphabet-of-feminism-21-u-is-for-uterus/">womb</a></em> has long been seen as synonymous with &#8216;woman&#8217; (however reductively); <em>bottom / arse –</em> ok; <em>because / breasts&#8230; </em>um?; <em>yes / cunt – </em>hmm.</p>
<p>I suspect this last pairing has a lot to do with the affirmation of sex: interaction with this organ <strong>should</strong> be one preceded by <em>yes </em>and punctuated with repetitions of this confirmation (<em>yes yes yes</em>). (Why James Joyce, you filthy&#8230;). We see a similar thing in Usher (first time for everything): the repeated <em>yeah, yeah, yeah </em>is a sexual affirmation – &#8216;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiXbRBS5Z58">How the hell am I supposed to leave??</a>&#8216;. This is about a female seduction (&#8216;she&#8217;s saying &#8220;come get me&#8221;!&#8217;), but one that we suspect will not end in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCss0kZXeyE">when-i&#8217;m-sixty-four</a> style knitting by the fire. For one thing, we learn that Usher already has a &#8216;<a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/11/15/an-alphabet-of-femininism-7-g-is-for-girl/">girl</a>&#8216;, who happens to be &#8216;the best of homies&#8217; with this club seductress; for another, Ludacris announces they will leave after a couple of drinks because they &#8216;want a <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/12/20/an-alphabet-of-femininism-12-l-is-for-lady/">lady</a> in the street but a freak in the bed&#8217;. So actually, the art of being a <em>lady </em>lies in effectively concealing a consent that, in private, becomes loud, repeated and unstoppable.</p>
<h3>Yes Indeed</h3>

<p>This is a well-trodden path, and all part of the old idea of how consent given too easily (<em>yes yes yes</em>) – or, in some cases, even given at all – is liable to get females into trouble. A less well-trodden example is Richardson&#8217;s <strong>Sir Charles Grandison </strong>(1753), which devotes several hundred of its thousand or so pages to what happens after the protagonist has proposed to his fiance: though she has accepted the proposal, she fears that to &#8216;name the day&#8217; herself – or even to consent to a &#8216;day&#8217; suggested to her – would be to show a forwardness disturbing in a woman. Disturbing perhaps, but probably a relief to the exhausted reader, for she manages to suspend her final consent to &#8216;thursday a month hence&#8217; for an entire blushing, confused volume of this hefty tome.</p>
<p>We can go further back, of course: in Shakespeare-times, Juliet fears Romeo will think she is &#8216;too quickly won&#8217;. To correct this, she offers to &#8216;frown, and be perverse, and say thee <em>nay</em>&#8216; (<em>no no yes</em>), artificially constructing a well-won consent where positive affirmation already exists (history does not record whether or not Juliet was &#8216;a freak in the bed&#8217;). Many would-be Romeos have seized on such fears to assume (or convince themselves) that this is just what their ladies are doing when they give an unequivocal &#8216;no&#8217;, so seduction narratives are littered with lovers assuming their lovers really mean <em>yes </em>when they reply in the negative<em> – </em>examples have spanned Austen&#8217;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWx7AF8B0R8&amp;feature=related">Mr Collins</a> to modern day Mills &amp; Boon. Apparently, in the latter case, one is supposed to find this irresistible.</p>
<h3>Go No More A-Roving</h3>
<p>We&#8217;re teetering around something rather insidious here, and one aspect of this finds its expression in a 1940s propaganda poster. The &#8216;Easy Girlfriend&#8217; anti-VD advert placed the blame for the Second World War venereal epidemic squarely with the momento-mori type be-hatted skull (a sexually experienced re-appropriation of the medieval <a href="http://www.abcgallery.com/B/baldung/baldung16.JPG">Death and the Maiden</a> trope). &#8216;The &#8220;easy&#8221; girlfriend spreads syphilis and gonorrhea&#8217;, it blazed – she who says <em>yes </em>too easily is to be shunned by polite society, and will be – <em>naturellement </em>– riddled with disease. Of course, syphilis&#8217; original spread throughout Europe had followed the path of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Tour">Grand Tour</a>, but this must have been because Venetian prostitutes were taking expensive package holidays throughout France, Spain, Rome, Switzerland and Turkey, mustn&#8217;t it, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Byron">Lord Byron</a>?</p>
<p>So while you probably disagree with Joyce&#8217;s view that <em>yes </em>is an intrinsically female word, it&#8217;s certainly one whose utterance is littered with potential problems for women. <em>Yes </em>means <em>yes. </em></p>
