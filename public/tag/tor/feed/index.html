					<description><![CDATA[The linkpost is back!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Been a bit of a gap with the linkposts lately, while the ed got a new job and we all remembered about mince pies coming back on sale. </p>
<p>Let us fix that for you now. </p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;History needs to stop being used as an excuse in the fantasy stories of TV, film, and video games that are, in general, male-dominated whether they’re history-based or not.&#8221; Word. Dan Wohl at The Mary Sue: <a href="http://www.themarysue.com/sexism-in-historical-fantasy/" target="_blank"><strong>Is &#8216;historical accuracy&#8217; a good defence of patriarchal societies in fantasy fiction?</strong></a></li>
<li>&#8220;&#8230;this notion that History Is Authentically Sexist&#8230; what do you mean when you say &#8216;history?&#8217; History is not a long series of centuries in which men did all the interesting/important things and women stayed home and twiddled their thumbs in between pushing out babies, making soup and dying in childbirth.&#8221; Tansy Rayner Roberts follows the Mary Sue&#8217;s post over on Tor: <a href="http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/12/historically-authentic-sexism-in-fantasy-lets-unpack-that" target="_blank"><strong>Historically authentic sexism in fantasy. Let&#8217;s unpack that.</strong></a></li>
<li>&#8220;The so-called middle ground that&#8217;s supposed to prevent disunity always ends up excluding women in an attempt to keep those who want to restrict their ministry happy. And funnily enough, this doesn&#8217;t exactly instill in women a sense of unity and grace. It makes some of them feel as if they can&#8217;t do what they feel called to do, what they are gifted to do.&#8221; A thoughtful set of reflections from Hannah Mudge: <a href="http://ontoberlin.blogspot.co.uk/2012/12/bristol-christian-union-and-ban-on.html" target="_blank"><strong>Bristol Christian Union and the &#8216;ban&#8217; on women speakers</strong></a>. </li>
<p>And finally&#8230; </p>
<li><a href="http://wheelr.tumblr.com/post/36767840644/vatw-tmm1" target="_blank">&#8220;Announcing <strong>Valentin &#038; The Widow</strong>, a free weekly audio book series! It’s a globe-trotting 1920s adventure about plucky English aristocrat Eleanora Rosewood, brawny Russian sailor Sacha Valentin, and their fight against a secret organisation that seeks to oppress the weak and destroy the different.&#8221;</a> We are listening to this with interest &#8211; it&#8217;s written by Andrew Wheeler, who among many other things penned the <a href="http://www.bleedingcool.com/tag/no-more-mutants/" target="_blank">No More Mutants</a> columns on inclusion and geek culture over on Bleeding Cool, which we linked from this site a while ago. Plus, &#8220;courageous women! Sexy men!&#8221;. How often do you hear anything advertised with the words in that order? (The <a href="http://wheelr.tumblr.com/post/37317840974/valentin-the-widow-the-mandrake-machine-part" target="_blank">second instalment just came out</a>.)</li>
</ul>
