										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello my darlings!  This month I&#8217;m back to my mid-month gaming post (as last month I wandered into the<a title="Silent Witness s15: ‘Calm down, dear…’" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/05/28/silent-witness-s15-calm-down-dear/" target="_blank"> realms of TV</a>) and I&#8217;ll be presenting to you the Humble Bundle V, after which we&#8217;ll be taking a bit of a negative turn&#8230; you will see.  Potential <em>trigger warning</em>, mind you, of the Epic Rage descent.</p>
<h3>Humble Bundle V</h3>
<p>The <strong><a title="The Humble Bundle" href="http://www.humblebundle.com" target="_blank">Humble Bundle</a></strong> is a nice little concept: a collection of indie titles for you to pay what you want for and then decide how much of that fee goes to a) the developers, b) Humble Bundle themselves, or c) charity.</p>
<p>I got it on the first day (and, sorry, but by the time this post goes live I suspect the window will have closed) so I only got the first five games that were included.  Since then there&#8217;ve been three more titles added if you paid over the average.  These were added in light of this bundle making over <a title="PC Gamer: Humble Indie Bundle makes $1.8m in first 15 hours" href="http://www.pcgamer.com/2012/06/01/humble-indie-bundle-5-makes-1-8-million-in-15-hours/?ns_campaign=article-feed&amp;ns_mchannel=ref&amp;ns_source=steam&amp;ns_linkname=0&amp;ns_fee=0" target="_blank">$1.8 million in the first 15 hours</a>.</p>
<p>Included in the Bundle were:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Psychonauts</strong></li>
<li><strong>Amnesia: The Dark Descent</strong></li>
<li><strong>LIMBO</strong></li>
<li><strong>Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sorcery EP</strong></li>
<li><strong>Bastion</strong>*</li>
<li><strong>Braid</strong>*+</li>
<li><strong>Lone Survivor</strong>*+</li>
<li><strong>Super Meat Boy</strong>*+</li>
</ul>
<p><em>* denotes games that were unlocked if you paid over the average; + denotes those titles added at a later stage.</em></p>
<p>Like I say, I only got the first five, but I&#8217;m not too sore as I already have <strong>Braid</strong> (not a big fan) and I&#8217;m not overly interested in the other two.  I&#8217;m not going to discuss the games themselves here because that&#8217;ll be coming in a &#8220;Playing&#8230;&#8221; post later on.</p>
<p>I thought it would be nice show you that sometimes, somewhere out there, someone does something good.  A lot of money has been raised for charity through this: not least through Big Names of Gaming competing to be the top contributors (<em>Notch</em> and <em>HumbleBrony Bundle</em> have been vying for the top spot: when I bought the bundle they were dueling around the $3000 mark, now they&#8217;re on $12,345.67 and £11,111.11 respectively).</p>

<p>Of course, as the popularity of indie games continues to rise, it&#8217;s nice to be able to have the choice to decide how much of your cash goes to the developers as opposed to not really knowing for sure how much just gets kept by various third parties.</p>
<h3>Sigh, Misogyny</h3>
<p>From that nice little snippet of camaraderie, I regret that I must now depress the tone somewhat and talk about InternetFail, and more specifically, how it&#8217;s been discussed recently with regard to the world of gaming.</p>
<p>At the start of June <strong>BBC News Magazine</strong> ran an article highlighting the constant, abhorrent abuse that female gamers get in online play: <a title="BBC News Magazine: Sexual harrasment in the world of video games" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-18280000" target="_blank">here</a>.  It mostly focusses on the experiences of one Wisconsin gamer called Jenny, of the<strong> CoD</strong> ilk, and the abuse she gets daily on voice chats.  She records them and uploads them to her website, <strong><a title="Not in the Kitchen Anymore" href="http://www.notinthekitchenanymore.com/" target="_blank">Not in the Kitchen Anymore</a></strong>, and I gotta say, she handles this shit pretty well but the point is she<em> shouldn&#8217;t have to</em>.  Especially, as the article points out, 42% of US gamers are women, and adult women outnumber teenage boys quite considerably.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a <a title="BBC World Service: Assignment: Guns, Girls and Games" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00s9jly" target="_blank">BBC World Service programme</a> based on her experiences and those of other female gamers.  If you read the article or listen to the programme you might hear some charming young fellows claiming<em> &#8220;freedom of speech&#8221;</em>, but here&#8217;s a point of interest for any such time someone tries to use this smokescreen of an excuse if you call them out as misogynists (or racists, homophobes, etc&#8230; the list, depressingly, goes on).  In both American and European (incl. British) law the &#8220;freedom of speech&#8221; excuse doesn&#8217;t fly.</p>
<p>Why&#8217;s that?  Well, if you actually read the laws you&#8217;ll see there are exclusions to what the precious First Amendment protects: <a title="Wikipedia: Freedom of Speech in the USA - Categorical Exclusions" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech_in_the_United_States#Categorical_exclusions" target="_blank">look here</a>.  What&#8217;s that?  Obscenity?  Threats?  Defamation?  Intentional infliction of emotional distress?  They&#8217;re <em>all</em> excluded from protection by the First Amendment?  OHGAWDNO!  It&#8217;s like living in a world where people treat each other with respect!  How horrible.</p>
<p>And, Euro law?  <em>Just for starters</em> you can consult <a title="Wikipedia: Article 10 of the ECHR" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_10_of_the_European_Convention_on_Human_Rights" target="_blank">Article 10</a> and <a title="Wikipedia: Article 14 of the ECHR" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights#Article_14_-_discrimination" target="_blank">Article 14</a> of the European Convention of Human Rights.  Yeah.  <strong><em>Human rights</em></strong>.  But be careful out there: trying to educate these fools in the error of their ways <strong>and</strong> the legal flaws in their defence might offend them.  The fact you&#8217;ve done some learnings <em>(that aren&#8217;t centred around how to make tasty lunchtime treats)</em> is clearly a work of pure evil!</p>
<p>Although Jenny of Wisconsin might be able to deal with it, there are a lot of people out there who can&#8217;t or don&#8217;t want to.  It takes a lot of effort, seriously.  I&#8217;m an antisocial gamer &#8211; we know this &#8211; I like playing games on my own, I hate chat and I hate voice-chats even more.  I don&#8217;t want to listen to somebody&#8217;s inane drivel while I shoot stuff, regardless of the content.  I ditched the <a title="[Gamer Diary] The Case of the MMOs – Boisterous Behaviour Abounds!" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/08/16/gamer-diary-the-case-of-the-mmos-boisterous-behaviour-abounds/" target="_blank">one MMO I played</a> a long time ago because of the racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic crap that occurred on a daily basis.  Not directed at me, just <em>there</em> &#8211; and no one really ever objected (if you did, you got the abuse turned on you).</p>
<p>My solution is not one that everyone can adopt.  I just avoid the social elements, even if it&#8217;s online team-based play like <strong>TF2</strong>, and I refuse to disclose any information about myself.  Generally, I am the wallpaper: I keep quiet and ignore chat.  This is mostly because I&#8217;m a misanthrope and do not care for being social, but partly it&#8217;s also because I know that a lot of people on chat are going to be dicks.  I just don&#8217;t understand why banter has to be offensive, even if it doesn&#8217;t go near questions of gender.</p>

<p>But back to the specific point of misogyny in the gamingverse.  I mentioned the KickStarter from <strong>Feminist Frequency</strong> in May&#8217;s &#8220;<a title="[Gamer Diary] – What I’ve Been Playing… May 2012" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/06/08/gamer-diary-what-ive-been-playing-may-2012/" target="_blank">Playing&#8230;</a>&#8221; post and the woman behind it, Anita Sarkeesian, has been yet another figurehead victim of abuse.  She put her head over that parapet, so to speak, and has had it all but <a title="New Statesman: Dear Internet, this is why you can't have nice things" href="http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/internet/2012/06/dear-internet-why-you-cant-have-anything-nice" target="_blank">shot to smithereens</a>.  Gladly, however, this isn&#8217;t going to stop her making those videos, nor <a title="KickStarter: Tropes vs women in video games" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/566429325/tropes-vs-women-in-video-games" target="_blank">has it stopped people pledging</a> (when I last checked, she was on $87,000+ with 68 hours left to go).  But this sort of thing does make me want to adopt a superhero persona, fly all over the world, and stand in defence of these women.</p>
<p>I was going to say &#8220;brave women&#8221; just ther, but that, to me, gives too much credit to these scum-sucking parasites of the internet.  It shouldn&#8217;t have to be brave just to identify as female and like games.  <strong>FFS</strong>.</p>
<p>At least &#8211; if we&#8217;re to take anything positive away from this &#8211; this all-too-common abuse is being given more and more of a public face.  A site that BBC article mentions is <strong><a title="Fat, Ugly or Slutty" href="http://fatuglyorslutty.com/" target="_blank">Fat,  Ugly or Slutty</a></strong><em> (because that&#8217;s pretty much all you are if you&#8217;re a female gamer, apparently)</em> where you can upload screengrabs of sexist abuse/harrasment.  So, if you can catch the abuse you receive, or see, in a screen grab or a recording, make it known!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It mindboggles me beyond words when I read opinions along the lines of &#8220;HIV/AIDS is not a feminist issue&#8221;. I could go into this at some length, but I&#8217;m posting this from work, where my department and I are in the middle of running a World AIDS Day stall, so this is a fly-by post.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got ribbons, button badges, and a massive pile of red and white iced cupcakes.  &#8220;No ribbon for me, thanks&#8221; is a surprisingly common response, though people seem happy to take a cake without publicising their interest in WAD too openly &#8211; but almost equally prevalent are the people like the woman who murmurs, &#8220;I wear one of these every year, for my aunt&#8221;. HIV carries an incredible amount of stigma even in this country, and it is hugely important that we do everything we can to move the public consciousness on from this.</p>

<p>I told an otherwise-pretty-liberally-minded acquaintance of mine this year that I would be working on this stall. He burst into nervous, playground lurgy-fear laughter. <a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/wad2.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="1522" data-permalink="/2010/12/01/world-aids-day-shoutout/wad2/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/wad2.jpg?fit=478%2C640&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="478,640" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="wad2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/wad2.jpg?fit=224%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/wad2.jpg?fit=478%2C640&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1522" title="wad2" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/wad2-224x300.jpg?resize=224%2C300" alt="photo of tin of World AIDS Day &quot;act aware&quot; badges" width="224" height="300" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/wad2.jpg?w=224&amp;ssl=1 224w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/wad2.jpg?w=478&amp;ssl=1 478w" sizes="(max-width: 224px) 100vw, 224px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> Many countries around the world, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and southeast Asia, have limited or negligible access to up-to-date antiretroviral medication for the management of HIV infection, which Europe and the US have a monopoly on. This needs to change. And you know what? Properly managed, with people properly informed and risk-aware, the infection is, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7523212.stm">you see</a>, comparable in its day-to-day living impact with diabetes. But you don&#8217;t see people being suspended from their jobs, bullied by their neighbours, and ostracised at work for being diabetic.</p>
<p>Stephen Fry may have pissed a load of feminists off the other month, but <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/stephen-fry-people-can-make-a-difference-and-save-lives-2148088.html">I&#8217;ve never been so pleased to see someone so heavily retweeted</a>.</p>

You know &#8211; where you learnt about the tubes and the hormones, watched a video of someone giving birth and then a teacher put a condom on a banana and you were sent on your way. Maybe they also told you to wait til you were married, or you were 21, whichever came first. Hands up &#8211; yes, I thought so.</p>
<p>Mine was pretty similar (aside from one teacher telling us that an orgasm was like a really good sneeze… no, I don’t know either). Relationships and feelings and other relevant things weren&#8217;t discussed, and neither was abortion, despite the girl I sat next to in design tech having had one just the year before.</p>
<h3><strong>The A Word</strong></h3>
<p>In a way, I am relieved. Because I have seen some of the <a title="The Guardian - Shock tactics" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2008/nov/25/anti-abortion-schools" target="_self">materials</a> used to discuss abortion in schools all over the country, and they make my blood run cold. Most of it is little better than anti-choice propaganda, and much of it is simply untrue. Abortion makes you infertile, abortion gives you breast cancer&#8230; These lies are imparted to young people at the hands of abortion &#8216;experts&#8217; who are invited into schools, often by well-meaning teachers desperate for guidance on how best to handle &#8216;the A word&#8217;. Young people deserve better than this.</p>
<p>The problem goes far deeper than the curriculum, of course. Abortion happens, whether it is legal or not, safe or not, all over the world. Globally, about 1 in 5 pregnancies end in abortion (some <a title="Guttmacher Institute" href="http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/fb_IAW.html" target="_self">global </a>and <a title="Education for Choice" href="http://www.efc.org.uk/Foryoungpeople/Factsaboutabortion/Statistics" target="_self">local</a> stats). Reluctance to discuss abortion openly and truthfully in the media and in popular culture is doing untold damage to individuals and to women&#8217;s precious right to choose. How are teachers and youth workers meant to offer unbiased information and support if they themselves have never had the chance to have an open discussion? To hear the facts?</p>
<h3><strong>Secrets and lies</strong></h3>
<p>Refusing to tackle the subject of abortion allows stigma to flourish, putting young people facing unplanned pregnancy in a position where they may not even feel able to ask for help. Scaring young women into carrying an unwanted pregnancy to term benefits no one.</p>
<p>But no matter, right? There’s plenty of information freely available, and countless support and counselling services. So here’s a fun game: why not google ‘pregnancy counselling’ and let me know how many of those first page results you reckon are really offering unbiased information? If you find any really choice quotes please comment and share!</p>
<h3><strong>Freedom to choose</strong></h3>
<p>I’m not assuming all BadRep’s readers are pro-choice, but I’m sure there are some of you. Perhaps, like me, you’ve waved a placard or shouted into a megaphone for a woman’s right to choose and to control her own body.</p>
<p>Standing up for safe, legal abortion is vital, as there are plenty of people who will take any opportunity they can to turn the clock back on reproductive freedom. Some of them are sitting in Westminster right now, deciding your future. (That’s a nice thought, isn’t it?)</p>
<p>But the war is also being waged quietly and efficiently on another front, in our classrooms and in a host of so-called counselling clinics. It’s up to us to expose the propagandists and arm young people with the facts so that they can make their own decisions.</p>

<h3><strong>Yes! But how? </strong></h3>
<p>Well… *puts on charity trustee hat* <strong><a title="Education for Choice" href="http://www.efc.org.uk/Home" target="_self">Education for Choice</a> </strong>are the first line of defence. They are the only UK-based educational charity dedicated to enabling young people to make informed choices about pregnancy and abortion.</p>
<p>With their mighty army of four staff they do heroic battle against the forces of misinformation on a shoestring budget. Times are hard for everyone right now, but in order for EFC to continue working in schools, with youth workers and health professionals, they urgently need your help.</p>
<p>Please:</p>
<ul>
<li>Donate      £5, £10, or whatever you can spare to their <a title="EFC on Justgiving" href="http://www.justgiving.com/Education-For-Choice0" target="_self">emergency fund</a></li>
<li>Pledge      your support for the <a title="The A Word Campaign" href="http://www.thepetitionsite.com/1/theAword/" target="_self">A      Word campaign</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Help EFC put abortion in the spotlight and make sure that young people’s right to unbiased information is at the top of the agenda.</p>
