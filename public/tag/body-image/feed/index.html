										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the latest in my scattered series on &#8216;comics wot I love which are a bit feminist&#8217; (previous posts include <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/11/02/battle-angel-alita-and-cyborg-feminism/" target="_blank"><strong>Battle Angel Alita</strong></a>, <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/05/24/black-orchid-ecofeminism-and-the-feminine-superheroic/" target="_blank"><strong>Black Orchid</strong></a>, and <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/08/03/tank-girl-vs-my-enemies/" target="_blank"><strong>Tank Girl</strong></a>). I&#8217;ve been meaning to write this one since the good ship BadRep set sail nearly three years ago, but I&#8217;ve struggled because I love this comic series so hard I can&#8217;t really get it down in words.</p>
<div id="attachment_13775" style="width: 309px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Maggie-and-Hopey.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13775" data-attachment-id="13775" data-permalink="/2013/06/14/why-its-time-to-read-love-rockets/maggie-and-hopey/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Maggie-and-Hopey.jpg?fit=499%2C600&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="499,600" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Maggie and Hopey" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Maggie-and-Hopey.jpg?fit=250%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Maggie-and-Hopey.jpg?fit=499%2C600&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-13775 " alt="Hopey and Maggie walking arm in arm" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Maggie-and-Hopey.jpg?resize=299%2C360" width="299" height="360" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-13775" class="wp-caption-text">Hopey and Maggie, Jaime Hernandez 1990</p></div>
<h3>Love. And. Rockets.</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re at all interested in comics or graphic novels you&#8217;ve probably heard of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_and_Rockets_(comics)"><strong>Love &amp; Rockets</strong></a>, and you&#8217;ve probably had someone like me tell you about how amazing it is and how you should read it immediately. I&#8217;ll try not to labour the point, but it is really, really worth having a look.</p>
<p>The scope of the series, which ran from 1981-1996 &#8211; with further stories being added since 2001 &#8211; can be a bit daunting, which is why Fantagraphics have produced a guide to <a href="http://www.fantagraphics.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=76&amp;Itemid=135">how to read <strong>Love &amp; Rockets</strong></a>.</p>
<p>In brief: the <strong>Love &amp; Rockets</strong> title encompasses two separate but slenderly-connected worlds, with Gilbert Hernandez writing about the fictional Central American village Palomar and its inhabitants, and brother Jaime Hernandez writing about the adventures of two <em>punkeras</em> in 1980s California.</p>
<p>Both sets of stories span decades, with meandering plots, sprawling casts, and for my money, the emotional depth and philosophical reach of any &#8216;great&#8217; work of literature. There are touches of magic realism, and sex and violence feature prominently, although they are hardly glamourised. If anything, the comics focus on the mundane, everyday details of two tangles of human lives with the occasional connecting thread.</p>
<h3>Women and humans</h3>
<p>What makes each half of the series so compelling (and they are &#8211; I have pulled more than one all-nighter working my way to the end of a story arc) is the incredible ability of both artists to give their characters life. And more than that, to make them <em>human</em>, with all the cruelty, confusion and compassion that that involves. I&#8217;m trying to pick my way through a bog of clichés here, but for me the Hernandez brothers are up there with Shakespeare and George Eliot in their characterization.</p>
<p>And a hugely important part of that for me is that both worlds have magnificent, believable, complex, varied and interesting female characters. Tons and tons of them, and they get plot. In fact, they get the bulk of the plot. Some are &#8216;strong female characters&#8217; in the most literal sense (rather than the hilarious <a href="http://harkavagrant.com/index.php?id=311" target="_blank">Hark! A Vagrant sense</a>) as the cast includes a number of women wrestlers and superheroes. That may sound ridiculous, but trust me, they pull it off.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no way I could do justice to the whole series in a single post (but <a href="http://colorlines.com/archives/2002/03/locas_rule.html" target="_blank">Colourlines</a> has a good introduction) so I&#8217;m going to zoom in on my favourite, the &#8216;Locas&#8217; stories by Jaime Hernandez, starring two of the most brilliant comic book heroines of all time: kind, adventure-prone Maggie the Mechanic, and spiky, compulsively subversive Hopey Glass.</p>
<h3>Maggie and Hopey</h3>

<p>We meet best friends and occasional lovers Maggie and Hopey in their late teens, in the fictional town of Hoppers in California. The fact that the two main protagonists in this world-famous, best-selling comic book series are queer latinas is almost enough on its own to recommend reading it as I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve noticed that the comics world isn&#8217;t exactly overflowing with such characters. Incidentally, <a href="http://geekfeminism.org/2012/02/05/yet-another-list-comics-with-women-of-color/" target="_blank">Geek Feminism</a> has a short list of comics featuring women of colour.</p>
<p>At the start Maggie takes a job as a &#8216;pro-solar&#8217; engineer, and her early stories feature spaceships, dinosaurs and female wrestlers who moonlight as superheroes (there are a lot of these) but when she returns to Hoppers the story sheds a lot of the B-movie trappings and focuses on more earthbound challenges, including love requited and unrequited, friends, enemies, and age.</p>
<p>We follow them, together and apart, over the next 30 years, during which time they change considerably, including their appearance. Most famously, Maggie puts on a lot of weight.</p>
<h3>Bodies and sex</h3>
<p>At the <a href="http://www.comicafestival.com/index.php/site/news/sold_out_comica_conversation_with_jaime_hernandez_woodrow_phoenix" target="_blank">Comica event </a>Hernandez spoke at recently, he was asked how he responded to some fans&#8217; complaints about Maggie&#8217;s weight and their persistent hope that she would lose it and get &#8216;pretty&#8217; again. He replied: “Oh, I just have to say &#8216;you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about&#8217;. Maggie is heavy. She is the only heavy person in comics, <em>still</em>. Why is she the only heavy person in comics?”</p>
<p>While Maggie does worry a little about her weight, it never bothers her lovers, and she is not ostracised or ridiculed or any of the other things we are taught to fear may befall us if we get fat.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s something else I love about the Locas stories: they can be a good antidote to body image argh, not just because there&#8217;s a huge range of body types on show (there is a lot of nudity – again, it doesn&#8217;t tend to be glamorous) but because they are drawn with such skill and honesty that it is impossible to be ashamed.</p>
<p>And, well, the comics are sexy. Not in a brittle, cookie-cutter, performative way (although that is examined too when some of the characters begin working in a strip club<sup><a href="/2013/06/14/why-its-time-to-read-love-rockets/#footnote_0_13764" id="identifier_0_13764" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" YES, that&rsquo;s right, it even portrays sex workers as real people! ">1</a></sup> ) but in the way that real people are sexy.</p>
<p>At the Comica event, Hernandez said he aims to treat sex just like anything else in the stories “because that&#8217;s how life is: you have sex, then make a sandwich. It&#8217;s that stream of life thing.” He added that even now he can&#8217;t draw a &#8216;pin up&#8217; or deliberately &#8216;sexy&#8217; female character without knowing anything about her.</p>
<h3>Representation and truth</h3>
<div id="attachment_13770" style="width: 279px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG-20130530-00354.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13770" data-attachment-id="13770" data-permalink="/2013/06/14/why-its-time-to-read-love-rockets/img-20130530-00354/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG-20130530-00354.jpg?fit=2592%2C1944&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="2592,1944" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;BlackBerry 9360&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Jaime Hernandez signed my book!" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG-20130530-00354.jpg?fit=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG-20130530-00354.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-13770     " alt="&quot;To Sarah - Thanx! Xaime&quot;" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG-20130530-00354.jpg?resize=269%2C202" width="269" height="202" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-13770" class="wp-caption-text">OMG OMG</p></div>
<p>This sensitivity and radical theme of &#8216;women as humans&#8217; was continued in Hernandez&#8217; comments about the decision to make Maggie and Hopey lovers.</p>
<p>At the start, the comic was in &#8216;freefall&#8217;, breaking all then rules and comic conventions, so it was about doing something different. But he explained that “I knew I had to back it up – I could put in as many Latinos as I wanted because I am one, I know that world. But with relationships between women I was aware of my responsibility to listen and understand.”</p>
<p>I&#8217;m just going to end up fangirling all over the shop, so I&#8217;ll end the post here. But really, seriously, get hold of a copy of the Locas stories; you won&#8217;t regret it. As Jaime said, <strong>Love &amp; Rockets</strong> doesn&#8217;t aim to be realistic, but truthful.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Page 3's been the horsefly on the cowpat of the Sun newspaper for years. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Page 3, revered by its supporters as &#8216;a British institution&#8217; and pushed by its owners as &#8217;empowering&#8217;, has been the horsefly on the cowpat of the Sun newspaper for years. In my early teens, pre-Internet, a glimpse of tit from a discarded copy of the Sun was my first vision of a naked breast. I&#8217;m also fairly sure it was the exact moment that I decided that mainstream, unimaginative, plastic-and-makeup porn wasn&#8217;t for me, but I digress.</p>
<p>Other people have made better arguments (<a title="The Sun's Page 3 is the highly visible tip of misogyny's iceberg" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/sep/14/sun-page-3-visible-tip-misogynys-iceberg" target="_blank">here&#8217;s one</a>, and <a title="Could this campaign to stop Page 3 succeed?" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/shortcuts/2012/sep/11/campaign-stop-page-3-succeed" target="_blank">here&#8217;s another</a>) than I could for why having a teenager with her tits out in the first few pages of a national newspaper might not be a particularly stellar idea. It&#8217;s objectification at its worst, and the empowerment argument neglects the fact that there are better, safer, and more rewarding ways to take your clothes off for financial gain if that&#8217;s what you truly want to do.</p>
<p>My argument against Page 3 is quite simple; if you don&#8217;t want to reject it simply because it&#8217;s in bad taste, insensitive, and chauvinistic, then reject it because it uses psychological techniques to manipulate your views into agreeing with whatever fits the Sun&#8217;s goals at the time. The Sun sees its readership not just as customers, but as bargaining chips and weapons.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a quick look at a few examples of Page 3. The rather excellent <a title="Tim Ireland" href="http://www.bloggerheads.com/business/" target="_blank">Tim Ireland</a> over at <a title="Bloggerheads" href="http://bloggerheads.com" target="_blank">Bloggerheads</a>, nemesis of Nadine Dorries, has been collecting these &#8211;  I hope he won’t mind me mirroring them here. Credit due entirely to him and anyone who might have scanned them for him.</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/page3-580w.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="12506" data-permalink="/2012/10/10/bread-and-circuses-why-page-3-is-even-worse-than-you-think/page3-580w-jpg/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/page3-580w.jpg?fit=580%2C1066&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="580,1066" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="page3-580w.jpg" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/page3-580w.jpg?fit=163%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/page3-580w.jpg?fit=557%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12506" title="page3-580w.jpg" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/page3-580w.jpg?resize=580%2C1066" alt="Screenshot showing Page 3's News In Briefs blurbs" width="580" height="1066" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/page3-580w.jpg?w=580&amp;ssl=1 580w, https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/page3-580w.jpg?w=163&amp;ssl=1 163w, https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/page3-580w.jpg?w=557&amp;ssl=1 557w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Now, it&#8217;s quite possible that these women hold these opinions. It&#8217;s quite interesting, however, that they coincide with the vitriol that appears in the <em>The Sun Says</em> portion of the paper, home of a much more blatant attempt to tell their readership what to think.</p>
<p>Think about this, though &#8211; what if these statements are invented by the paper? Then, what we have on our hands is a cheap attempt to use <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14674817/" target="_blank">the many cognitive biases that sexual attraction brings into play</a> to form an opinion in the undecided. This person is attractive; you&#8217;re naturally more inclined to agree with people that you find attractive; your opinion is swayed. All the time, you&#8217;re seeing it as just a bit of fun, just a silly piece of paper with a pair of breasts. Every day, this message hits home. Over time, it affects people &#8211; they think the way the Sun, and thus the Murdoch empire, wants them to think.</p>
<p>Yes, alright, I&#8217;ve strayed a bit into tin-foil-hat territory. The fact is, though, that this is having an effect on the Sun&#8217;s readership. How big an effect is arguable, of course, but it&#8217;s non-zero. Also, don&#8217;t forget that there&#8217;s a huge line on the role of these women &#8211; they&#8217;re being used as tools, to have opinions thrust into their mouths. Even the names are probably pseudonyms. They are there for no reason <em>at all</em> other than to be a pair of tits, and that shit is just not on.</p>
<p>If you won&#8217;t boycott the Sun because you hate the exploitation and objectification of women that it represents, boycott it because you value your own power of self-determination.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This post is belated &#8211; I thought I&#8217;d lost these pictures on an old phone &#8211; but wonder of wonders, miracle of miracles, I found them on my computer the other day. </p>
<p>Some time in 2010 or 2011 (I&#8217;m dating this by my handset) the Harley Medical Group started advertising plastic surgery on the tube. Images of pert models told women that they needed &#8216;new year, new confidence&#8217;. Plastic surgery is nothing new, but pushing that advertising on people as they go up the escalators was a new and unwelcome assault. &#8220;You&#8217;re on your way to work, by the way, have you considered that your tits could be better?&#8221; Then something wonderful happened: people started answering back.

<p>I was tickled to see a few with red printed &#8216;sexist shit&#8217; stickers which I&#8217;d seen sold at a feminist event a couple of weeks before&#8230; but then more appeared. People were writing their own slogans on stickers and whacking them on as the escalator sped them past. At first I just saw them at Kings Cross where I commuted through every day. Then, little by little, I saw them in more and more places. More handwriting, more slogans. This was&#8230; a movement.</p>

And then, as the posters went away, so the stickers did too. I noticed there was a second wave of plastic surgery ads a few months later which seemed to have toned down their rhetoric a little. Still crap that unnecessary surgery was being pushed on women but something seemed to have twigged with the advertisers, too. This level of crap will not stand. I salute you, culture-jammers of London. Long may you reign.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Here&#8217;s a post from <a href="http://quiteirregular.wordpress.com/">Jem Bloomfield</a>. If you have an idea for a guest post brewing in your brain, email us: <a href="mailto:badrepeditors@gmail.com?subject=Guest pitch!">badrepeditors@gmail.com</a>.</strong></p>
<p><em>She’s just a hungry girl,<br />
In a post-apocalyptic wooooorld&#8230;</em></p>
<p>When <strong>The Hunger Games</strong> came out, we were faced with possibly the most ludicrous and yet most predictable controversy in recent film history: was Katniss Everdeen too fat? More specifically, was Jennifer Lawrence the wrong body-shape to play the protagonist of these phenomenally successful novels, as a number of critics and fans said? One quotation from the <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/2012/03/23/movies/the-hunger-games-movie-adapts-the-suzanne-collins-novel.html?pagewanted=2"><strong>New York Times</strong></a> can stand in for a lot of others:</p>
<blockquote><p>A few years ago Ms. Lawrence might have looked hungry enough to play Katniss, but now, at 21, her seductive, womanly figure makes a bad fit for a dystopian fantasy about a people starved into submission.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not going to answer the question, because, y’know. But I do want to talk about why the question matters, because it’s not something so ludicrous we can dismiss it.<sup><a href="/2012/07/10/guest-post-clothes-horse-of-the-apocalypse-katniss-dress-size-and-the-book-of-revelation/#footnote_0_11440" id="identifier_0_11440" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" Though it is ludicrous. Let no doubt be left about that. ">1</a></sup></p>
<div id="attachment_10433" style="width: 206px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Katniss.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10433" data-attachment-id="10433" data-permalink="/2012/03/22/a-hunger-games-guest-roundtable/katniss/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Katniss.jpg?fit=196%2C253&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="196,253" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Katniss" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Katniss.jpg?fit=196%2C253&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Katniss.jpg?fit=196%2C253&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-10433" title="Katniss" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Katniss.jpg?resize=196%2C253" alt="Artwork of Katniss Everdeen from the UK book release, showing a pale young woman looking determined." width="196" height="253" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-10433" class="wp-caption-text">Cover design for an early UK release of the Hunger Games, by Jason Chan</p></div>
<p>Essentially, these readers were arguing the case for realism. Katniss has access to limited calories (though more than some other people, due to her own skills) – this is part of the plot, theme and indeed title of the novel – so an actor of a certain body type might be less able to inhabit the role convincingly onscreen. Just as Renee Zellweger visibly put on some weight to play Bridget Jones<sup><a href="/2012/07/10/guest-post-clothes-horse-of-the-apocalypse-katniss-dress-size-and-the-book-of-revelation/#footnote_1_11440" id="identifier_1_11440" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" No, I know. It&rsquo;s not like I don&rsquo;t have a problem with that too, but it&rsquo;s awful in a slightly different way&hellip; ">2</a></sup>, Jennifer Lawrence was expected to appear strikingly underweight to embody the theme of the narrative. It’s a simple biological fact.</p>
<p>Except, of course, that fact assumes that the <strong>Hunger Games</strong> trilogy, beloved of teenage girls in particular, is taking place in a cultural vacuum. That it just happens to involve a young woman with a fraught relationship to food, who is contrasted to the decadence and self-indulgence of the inhabits of the Capitol and other characters. I’m absolutely not arguing that these are harmful books, or that they’re written thoughtlessly. Nor is it my place to tell young women how they should interact with art. But I am pointing out that novels don’t become popular for no reason, particularly YA novels with strong female leads.</p>

Again, there is an argument that the fictional situation happens to involve a character who would have a particular physical appearance. But that discourse of realism and “accuracy” totally ignores the hundreds of images which young women are bombarded with every day. It assumes that young women are never told they’re too fat or too skinny, that they lack self control or a sense of proportion, that their success in life is directly related to their dress size. It assumes that when actors like Jennifer Lawrence relax in between film-shoots, there aren’t packs of photographers with zoom-lenses feeding the websites which police their bodies and point out how they’ve “let themselves go”. Talk about “accuracy” is deeply naive because it ignores the way actors’ public personas are constructed, how their lifestyle is carefully confused with the roles they choose and how their bodies are used in advertising. It also ignores the power of performance to draw us into a fictional world and convince us of its reality, surely one of the main reasons anyone films a book in the first place.</p>
<p>So much for the hungry girl, but I don’t think we can ignore the post-apocalyptic world and its relevance to this controversy. Katniss isn’t just a young woman who finds herself short on nosh after the shops have shut, she’s the central figure in a futuristic wasteland. “Post-apocalyptic” has also come in for a bit of controversy recently, with Mark Kermode demanding with typically entertaining zeal that if the apocalypse is the end of the world, then how can a film be post-apocalyptic? If the apocalypse has happened, and there’s anything left to have a film about, then that my friend is a shoddy apocalypse and you want to demand another one, that works like it says on the packet. Highly pleasing as this is, and far be it from me to out-pedant the worshipful Doctor, but apocalypse does not mean the end of the world.</p>
<p>Apocalypse means “revelation” or the “lifting of the veil”. The book we get most of our apocalyptic imagery from – four horsemen, 666, Whore of Babylon riding on a seven-headed beast, you know the drill – is referred to as both the Apocalypse of St. John and the Book of Revelation. The fact that the most famous one is most frequently framed as a vision of the end of the world means that we tend to assume that they’re the same thing (if we’re not massive pedants and unhealthily obsessed with etymology &#8211; oh no, wait&#8230;). But the crucial aspect is the “lifting of the veil”, the revealing of a deeper reality which is obscured by the world around us.<sup><a href="/2012/07/10/guest-post-clothes-horse-of-the-apocalypse-katniss-dress-size-and-the-book-of-revelation/#footnote_2_11440" id="identifier_2_11440" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" The titles of The Vision of Ezra and the Sibylline Oracles &ndash; both around during the first centuries of Christianity though neither made it into the Bible(s) &ndash; underline this point. ">3</a></sup></p>
<p>I’m not bringing this up for the sake of sheer quibble (though that would be reason enough), but because I think a lot of post-apocalyptic fiction still has this original meaning embedded in it. So many post-apocalyptic films and novels have this sense of being not only “after the disaster” but also “after the revelation”, trying to strip back the complexities and confusions of modern life to get to what is basic and essential about us. In <strong>The Road</strong>, that’s the emotional bond between father and son, in <strong>Mad Max</strong> the depravity of humans as pack animals, in <strong>Escape From New York</strong> it’s a macho code of integrity.<sup><a href="/2012/07/10/guest-post-clothes-horse-of-the-apocalypse-katniss-dress-size-and-the-book-of-revelation/#footnote_3_11440" id="identifier_3_11440" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" And with more time we could read right back from Snake Plissken&rsquo;s tattoo to the Man With No Name, and wonder how much the classic Western is also driven by a desire to get its characters out into the oddly moonscapey deserts, to strip away the civilization.

<p>And in <strong>The Hunger Games</strong> it’s a famished young woman. If a deeper reality is being revealed in this apocalypse, a profound truth about humanity which lies beneath the surface of modern life, then it’s one which looks very similar to the line peddled by fashion magazines, diet books and vast swathes of Hollywood’s output. That young women should look as if they’re slightly undernourished. The tendencies of post-apocalyptic fiction mean that this film risks holding that image up as not only an ideal to aspire to, but as the most “natural” and “essential” state for them to be in.</p>
<p>Again, this doesn’t make <strong>The Hunger Games</strong> a bad book or a bad film, but it means that the way Katniss Everdeen is portrayed onscreen cannot be reduced to a question of “accuracy” to a description in the book. A film which presents a teenage girl as the prototypical member of humanity is a wonderful idea – not least because she’s active, intelligent and fighting on behalf of her people &#8211; but this one sits at the intersection of some very powerful cultural influences which we can’t ignore.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[What the hell IS an ActiPearl, anyway?!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Hi, nice to meet you. You&#8217;re looking great today, really confident and independent, good for you! A shame about the smell, though. I mean, really, everybody&#8217;s noticed it. And we all know it&#8217;s coming from, ahem, <em>down there</em>.</p>
<p>“Oh no, no, it&#8217;s OK, don&#8217;t get offended, it&#8217;s not your fault. You can&#8217;t help it, I understand that. Your genitals are disgusting and they stink, especially when they&#8217;re bleeding and there&#8217;s nothing you can do about it. You didn&#8217;t ask to be born with such a terrible curse, and nobody expects you to take responsibility for it. Help is at hand, though! If you give me lots of money every month for forty years of your life, we can help! Because believe us, you need it&#8230;”</p>
<p>I will admit up front that I am not a trained marketer, but it&#8217;s plain to see that the above isn&#8217;t the most convincing of sales pitches. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s a far more honest pitch than <a title="Always ActiPearls official page" href="http://www.always-info.co.uk/whats-new/always-acti-pearls-pads.aspx">the current campaign for Always sanitary towels</a>, which proudly declare the addition of “odour neutralising ActiPearls” as the next step in the evolution of &#8220;feminine hygiene&#8221; products. What the ads coyly decline to mention is that they&#8217;ve taken lessons in odour neutralisation from the Lynx school of “synthetic chemical stench and hygiene are THE SAME THING.”</p>
<p>This is straight-up vagina-shaming. It&#8217;s insulting and inexcusable. And giving me yet another reason to be pissed off when I&#8217;m already simmering with ire about the massacre going on between my legs is inadvisable. So congratulations, P&amp;G: you&#8217;ve lost my custom for the next thirty years.</p>
<p>The packaging claims to “neutralise odours rather than just masking them”. This is at best a delicate glossing over of the truth. It&#8217;s impossible to tell whether “odours” (those vaginal FIENDS!) are neutralised or not because of the perfume.</p>
<p>Oh God, the perfume.</p>
<p>I appreciate that scent perception can be a highly subjective thing, so I&#8217;ll attempt to keep the description as general as possible. Cloying, synthetic, sweet florals with an undertone of disinfectant, false and stereotypically feminine. It hits you as soon as you open the packaging, before even unwrapping the first towel. A scent that lingers for hours even if you switch to an unscented brand immediately after using one of these. A scent that does not mask menstrual blood, but mingles with it into a nauseating aberration.</p>

<p>The problems presented by this are manifold, but there are three main ones that leapt out at me. Bullet point list time? Bullet point list time!</p>
<ul>
<li>The obvious implication that people who have vaginas are utterly clueless about personal hygiene and how to take care of themselves, plus the completely ignoring the fact that vaginas are self cleansing and look after themselves without much intervention from their owners beyond showering/bathing regularly. The idea that menstruation makes a person malodorous or otherwise “dirty” is an outdated and misogynistic notion. If a vagina IS smelling bad, whether through illness or neglect, adding an unpleasant artificial scent to the crotch is only going to make the problem worse.</li>
<li>Following on from this, people who are at least vaguely aware of their sexual health can tell from changes in vaginal scent if something untoward or unusual is going on. Trying to cover that up with perfumes isn&#8217;t going to help anybody stay in touch with their genitalia.</li>
<li>The choice of such a blatantly &#8220;overt femininity-pink-and-flowers-BECAUSE-THIS-PRODUCT-IS-FOR-GIRLLLSSS&#8221; fragrance risks alienating trans* men and genderqueer customers who choose to use these products. As if the patronising “have a happy period, always” slogan weren&#8217;t bad enough. Not only are Always trying to insist that a reminder of nature not necessarily assigning the genitalia that most closely match an individual&#8217;s gender identity should be a matter for celebration, but also that everybody should smell like a field full of artificial blossoms when their loins are creating underpant carnage. Way to consider the needs of your whole customer base, there.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, at the risk of incurring violent flames, I&#8217;ll admit that I am not the biggest fan of my vagina. I appreciate the vast capacity for pleasure that it and its associated physiological paraphernalia provide, but for the most part our relationship is one of tacit acknowledgement and grudging acceptance. This does not mean, however, that I do not appreciate the inherent beauty and wonder of such genitalia.</p>
<p>A vagina should smell like a vagina. A vagina should not smell of roses or perfumes or <a href="http://londonfeminist.com/site/femfresh-fail/">any number of artificial masking agents</a>. Every healthy vagina has a personality and life all of its own and scent to match.</p>
<p>At a time where in the USA, the wealthy, middle-aged, cis-male elitists running the country seem determined to drive women&#8217;s bodily autonomy and sexual rights back into the Victorian era, now seems a very prudent time to turn our eyes to our genitals and send a clear message to politicians and megabucks sanitary product manufacturers alike that our bodies belong to nobody but ourselves. Their efforts to undermine and deny our sexuality will be met with the resistance and fight it deserves, until they back the hell off what&#8217;s between our legs.</p>
<p>If we really must accept defeat and acknowledge that we are no longer capable of keeping our own vaginas spring-fresh, then our next step is clear: begin a campaign to <a title="Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab Perfumes" href="http://www.blackphoenixalchemylab.com/">Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab</a> to produce their own range of sanitary towels impregnated with their gorgeous scents. Because if my vagina isn&#8217;t allowed to smell like a vagina any more, it can do a hell of a lot better than Procter and Gamble&#8217;s sickly synthetic flower bleach.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I think shame is often strongly gendered; we are intended to feel it when we don't live up to our society's imposed, sexist expectations.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over 4 million people have seen <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCvmsMzlF7o">Brené Brown&#8217;s fantastic TED talk about Vulnerability</a>. She&#8217;s a researcher who looked into what successful people have in common, and found that they were all willing to make themselves vulnerable.</p>
<p>I was excited when she gave a follow-up talk in March, but I didn&#8217;t imagine I&#8217;d be posting about it on BadRep. The reason I am is that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psN1DORYYV0#t=15m0s">at 15.00 minutes</a>, it became ALL about gender. (I strongly recommend you check it out &#8211; both videos are excellent):</p>
<p>[<A href="http://youtu.be/psN1DORYYV0">We&#8217;re having trouble with embedding! Click this handy link instead!</a>]</p>
<p>Shame is often strongly gendered; we are intended to feel it when we don&#8217;t live up to our society&#8217;s imposed, sexist expectations. She cites a study from Boston College which got women to answer the question:</p>
<blockquote><p>What do women need to do to conform to female norms?</p></blockquote>
<p>The answers were: be Nice, Thin, Modest&#8230; and &#8216;Use all available resources for appearance&#8217;.</p>
<p>For men, they were: Always show emotional control, Work should be your priority, Pursue status&#8230; and &#8216;Violence&#8217;.</p>
<p>That they&#8217;re different answers for men and women should be enough to prove the need for some real changes in our society by itself, but that the actual points are also so disgusting just seals it for me. Nice. Thin. Don&#8217;t make a fuss. Physical appearance is everything. Emotionally cut off. Violent. Competitive. Judged hugely by job and status. <em>Not one of these things is good for society.</em> We could lose them all and it would only improve everyone&#8217;s lives. (Well, &#8216;nice&#8217; could be okay, if it were applied to the <em>more</em> powerful groups in society, but in terms of gender you&#8217;ve then still got the &#8216;chivalry&#8217; problem &#8211; that men can forget about power differences <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/01/25/keep-the-gift-pay-what-you-owe/">if they treat women &#8216;nicely&#8217;</a> while giving up nothing.)</p>
<p>Brown&#8217;s previous point had been that successful and happy people have to allow themselves the risk of being seen as weak, or to fail. However, in reaching that conclusion (and it&#8217;s definitely true), she only interviewed women. In this second talk she relates how a male fan pointed out to her that men often feel unable to choose this route.</p>
<blockquote><p>Shame feels the same for men and women, but it is organised by gender&#8230; </p>
<p>For men, shame is not a bunch of competing, conflicting expectations [as it is for women], shame is one: Do Not Be Perceived As Weak. </p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>Brené Brown</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The fan claims that it&#8217;s the women in his family who reinforce this for him. In terms of how strictly the two sets of &#8216;norms-to-conform-to&#8217; listed above are enforced, I often see that men have a lot more leeway in dropping one or two of them&#8230; but only if they replace them with &#8216;money&#8217;.</p>
<p>So the next time I&#8217;m looking for a shorthand example for why feminism is important, I&#8217;ll reference what people perceive as the <em>biggest</em> demands by society on who they are allowed to be. It&#8217;s a flawed, gender-binary test, but the fact that the public returned those answers counts for a lot. That a list so gendered and outrightly harmful to society should be the TOP pressures many of us seem to be facing is something we just don&#8217;t need. It may not be set in law, but <a href="http://nothingbutawordbag.wordpress.com/2012/04/22/gendered-marketing-really-gets-on-my-tits/" />this stuff is a strong daily message</a>.</p>
<p>&#8230;Which makes me want to find a solution. Well, first to scream F*** THAT and opt out, and <em>then</em> find a solution. Equality means removing this heinous bullshit for <em>everyone</em>. The goals listed as the top answers in that survey are both unattainable in size and harmful in practice, but what choice do we have? It&#8217;s fine for me to urge people to stop conforming, but for many if they do the reality is they&#8217;ll never pass a job interview again. (Although <a href="http://vagendamag.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/hair-not-musical.html">not shaving your armpits or legs sometimes works out just fine</a>). </p>
<p>I refuse to give up. Reducing inequality towards any gender is so fundamental to everyone&#8217;s happiness that stuff like this just makes me more determined to keep fighting: we&#8217;ve all got to keep educating each other, pushing for change and making the issues visible. Whether it&#8217;s about who they marry, if they have sex, issues of consent, or who their political leaders are, women have a lot less freedom than men <a href="http://www.womankind.org.uk/policy-and-resources/">internationally</a>. That&#8217;s not in dispute. Gender inequality is measurable. If you really can&#8217;t see it, you haven&#8217;t spent two seconds looking. Yes, I&#8217;m also concerned with the pressures sexism places on men, and I think these &#8216;norm lists&#8217; showcase exactly why there&#8217;s so much still to do for everybody.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I hate bra shopping.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had a day out with my Mum the other week, and feeling safely cosseted between the matriarchal protective spheres of Mum and Marks &amp; Spencers, I decided to brave a thing I dread: bra shopping. </p>
<p>I hate bra shopping. Generally I&#8217;m not a massive fan of shopping per se; it usually feels like a massive waste of time I could spend doing something <em>actually</em> relaxing, like having a cup of tea, or wandering around a museum. Or sleeping. Anything, really. But I digress.</p>

I hate them. Where to begin my hatred? A little history, perhaps. I do like a little historical context to flavour a problem. Makes me feel like a proper academic. Except one who uses wikpedia entries a lot &#8211; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brassiere">like this one here.</a></p>
<p>To summarise: basically there was nothing for quite a while (when literally people didn&#8217;t wear much at all), then there were togas (or for the ladies, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stola">stolas</a>) and people didn&#8217;t really care, then all of a sudden there were all kinds of things dedicated to &#8220;dealing with breasts&#8221;. There were bits of cloth in various arrangements with and without padding, corsets, bodices, and finally something that resembled the modern bra.</p>
<p>Which was <a href="http://womenshistory.about.com/od/mythsofwomenshistory/a/bra_burning.htm">never burned, incidently</a>, except possibly in awful household fires. And we had the <a href="http://desertblondie.hubpages.com/hub/Madonnas-80s-Cone-Bramaking-a-comeback">Madonna cone bra</a>, of course.</p>
<p>Then came the Wonderbra with its rallying cry of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonderbra"><em>Hello Boys</em></a>, and to be honest I was never 100% clear on whether she was advertising her mammaries <em>to</em> boys, or addressing them <em>as</em> boys, and it all got all a bit confusing so I tried not to think about it. Plus it arrived when I was 14, which is a Bad Time for bosom-related upset.</p>
<p>Skip forward a bit further and we get Shakira <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weRHyjj34ZE">declaring</a> in 2002 that it&#8217;s:</p>
<blockquote><p>Lucky that my breasts are small and humble<br />
So you don&#8217;t confuse them with mountains
</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230; which I&#8217;m still not really sure about, because, again, we&#8217;re getting all obsessed over size. Small or big? Which is better? (And why do we have to have better bodies anyway?) </p>
<p>My own &#8216;humble&#8217; beginnings: for me, the bra was a graduation from the pre-teen crop top and the childish vest into the world of being a Real Woman. Periods were also involved in this uncomfortable phase (and they are also rubbish and make your breasts sore, but you do not have to go to the shop and pay money for them). This was not a good start for the bra and I, and it didn&#8217;t get any better.</p>
<p>The portion of my adult life that I&#8217;ve spent around bras has always involved the fickle inconsistency of measurements. As an experiment, on my shopping trip I got measured in three different shops and tried on more bloody bras than I have done in my entire life. I am, for the record a 34, 36 or 32 A, B or C. So that&#8217;s not really a good start. Furthermore, none of these bras, in any of those official sizes, <em>actually</em> fit my chest. Some do better than others, but there is no general indicator of agreed size.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about what they look like. They&#8217;re mostly quite &#8216;girly&#8217;, except where they&#8217;re meant to be &#8216;sexy&#8217;. Ah, that old problem again. I can have a virgin bra or a whore bra. Great. They contain a lot of extraneous stuff like lace and bows and other frou-frou items that my bosom really doesn&#8217;t need, so I spend a lot of time snipping things off bras whilst hoping that the sheer volume of stuff I&#8217;m lopping off isn&#8217;t in some way structurally vital.</p>
<p>And what about underwire, while we&#8217;re at it? No item of clothing aimed at men, designed to sit on sensitive, soft flesh, would include metal wire within a flimsy silk and lace contraption, frequently destined to poke out and puncture your poor, unsuspecting skin. Underwire, together with its evil cousin Padding, is the great illusionist of the bra world. This is not a world in which the bra is only there to clothe, support or protect you. No, it is not a knight in shining armour: the bra is a churl and a pimp. It exists to <em>make your tits look nice</em>. And by &#8220;nice&#8221; I mean bigger and with cleavage. As opposed to, say, the way they actually look.</p>
<p>Being realistic, since my breasts are not large: I don&#8217;t <em>have</em> a cleavage without serious amounts of bra-mirage work, without which any &#8220;revealing&#8221; top tends to reveal a lot of&#8230; sternum. It&#8217;s nice sternum, but it&#8217;s not the look I&#8217;m &#8220;supposed&#8221; to have.  And even when I&#8217;m wearing the damn thing, it doesn&#8217;t fit. The cups leave gaps where my breasts are not. The straps are too tight or too loose, leaving red marks in my ribs and creating weird bumps of flesh around the sides or under my arms that an anxious person might negatively label &#8220;fat&#8221;. In the panic room of the changing cubicle, it&#8217;s easy to get worried. Especially when one&#8217;s chest appears to be both &#8220;fat&#8221; and &#8220;small&#8221; at the same time.</p>
<p>Simply put, bras aren&#8217;t designed for my body shape. The fact that the bra is a quintessentially &#8220;feminine&#8221; object makes me feel unfeminine. Sometimes I&#8217;m okay with that. Sometimes I&#8217;m not. And all of this creates the sneaking suspicion that my own breasts are not socially adequate by themselves. It isn&#8217;t nice to feel like your body is inadequate. And for the most part nowadays, I don&#8217;t. But I used to. A lot. Especially as an unhappy teenager. Various problems with food ensued. It was not a good time, and it is a not good time that many women (and men) go through.</p>
<p>But bras are not solely the enemy of &#8220;small&#8221; women. Curvy ladies also loathe bras, and perhaps with even more reason. For them, the bra is often essential. The larger the bra required, the more expensive it is. Also &#8211; so I&#8217;m told &#8211; the more complicated the re-arranging of weight around the body, creating more lines of soreness across the shoulders and an additional aesthetic difficulty of &#8216;too much&#8217; cleavage at inappropriate times.</p>
<p>Seriously, fuck bras.</p>
<p><strong>But what to do about it all?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Stop wearing them altogether?</em> Easy for me to say, as long as the weather isn&#8217;t cold and it doesn&#8217;t rain, but this won&#8217;t do for the larger-breasted, for whom some element of mammary management is essential to personal comfort. Similarly, I can&#8217;t go bra-less all the time &#8211; even for someone my size a trip to the gym requires something to stop the painful bouncing.</li>
<li><em>Buy other bras?</em> I keep being told that if I was only measured &#8220;correctly&#8221; I would be fine. I&#8217;m disputing this, because I&#8217;ve been measured a lot, and measuring me doesn&#8217;t seem to alter the sizes of bras which persist in being made for a particular shape of wearer who is not my shape. A lot of women&#8217;s clothes are like this. I shop around for those. Perhaps there are magical bra shops where one can purchase perfect fitting, soft and comfortable bras for around a tenner. I doubt it, though.</li>
<li><em>Wear a corset instead!</em> &#8230; no.</li>
<li><em>Strap them down?</em> Um. Well, whilst I <em>have</em> been known to do this, I don&#8217;t want to flatten my breasts <em>all</em> the time any more than I want to inflate them.</li>
<li><em>Buy a vest!</em> I do like vests, and there are lots of places that do vests with a bit of extra fabric at the top in case of sudden cold, or rain. </li>
<p>So I&#8217;ve bought loads. </p>
<p>And they&#8217;re great.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There were several predictable bones to pick with last week’s <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/feb/26/nme-60-editors-favourite-covers"><strong>Guardian</strong> piece</a> in which former editors of the <strong>New Musical Express</strong> selected their most noteworthy covers. The feature left out a lot of the former <strong>Accordion Weekly</strong>’s history, notably anything prior to the late 1970s, but what struck me most about the covers chosen was the disparity between the first one and the last. The <strong>NME</strong>&#8216;s <a href="http://velvetcoalmine.wordpress.com/2009/04/17/sleeping-with-the-nme-how-the-british-music-press-picked-up-a-dose-of-the-crap/">decline</a> from a vital and thoughtful read to a list-heavy vehicle for mutual backscratching seemed to be reflected in the journey from Pennie Smith&#8217;s 1979 cover shot of the Slits, then a relatively obscure and resolutely uncommercial dub-punk girl-gang, dressed in mud and loincloths, to, thirty years on, a cover featuring the monarch of manufactured mediocrity <a href="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/2/24/1330114355043/NME-covers---Simon-Cowell-002.jpg">in a headshot</a> which, to quote a commenter, makes the paper look like the <strong>Radio Times</strong>.</p>
<p>Smith’s photographs of the Slits mudlarking in the grounds of their Surrey recording studio became a defining image of the band, notably through being used on the cover of their debut album <strong>Cut</strong>. This article looks briefly at the controversy generated by the images themselves, and how it relates to subsequent and current presentation of women in the UK music press.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/NME-covers-The-Slits-001.jpg?resize=460%2C654" alt="Image copyright Pennie Smith/the NME, shared under Fair Use guidelines. A black and white image showing The Slits swinging from trees smeared with mud." width="460" height="654" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h3>Under the Cover</h3>
<p>The space provided by punk for female as well as well as male self-expression and emancipation can be overstated – see Helen Reddington’s <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=l5l4PiOfYTcC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=helen%20reddington%20lost%20women%20rock&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=helen%20reddington%20lost%20women%20rock&amp;f=false">research</a> on the persistence of entrenched chauvinist and sexist attitudes – but the Slits were unarguably, in the words of Caroline Coon, ‘driving a coach and various guitars straight through&#8230; the concept of The Family and female domesticity’. One of the first prominent bands to spring from the art-squats of punk west London, the Slits’ early music and performance was a squall of untrained, instinctive energy, and their casually confrontational appearance and behavior drew negative reactions ranging from media disapproval to violent hostility. Although tending to recoil from any overtly political espousal of feminism, the band bluntly advocated female independence and empowerment, encouraging girls to form bands and to define themselves by their actions rather than their relationships.</p>
<blockquote><p>‘We’re just not interested in questions about Women’s Liberation&#8230; You either think chauvinism’s shit or you don’t. We think it’s shit&#8230; Girls shouldn’t hang around with people who give them aggro about what they want to do. If they do they’re idiots.’<br />
&#8211; <strong><a href="http://www.punk77.co.uk/graphics/slits/carolinecoonpage4.jpg">Slits guitarist Viv Albertine, June 1977</a></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The image on the <strong>Cut</strong> cover fits into the Slits’ more general disruptions and subversions of accepted feminine tropes, including their punk-inspired adoption of fetish and bondage gear as deconstructed parts of an everyday wardrobe, and their plain-speaking on sex and sexuality. The band’s proto-Goth contemporary Siouxsie Sioux remarked that they &#8216;weren&#8217;t glamorous, they were very earthy&#8217;. The Slits’ aesthetic and behaviour onstage and off was repeatedly referenced in terms of wildness and ferocity, reinforcing their performance of an exoticised, &#8216;untamed&#8217; sexuality, which on the album cover clashed with the band’s bucolic backdrop to create an arresting mash-up of English Rose and Amazon.</p>
<h3>Covered in Controversy</h3>
<p>Having in their earlier career declined several offers from labels intent on exploiting the novelty aspect of a girl band, and battled with industry men who expected female musicians to ‘kowtow or flutter your eyelids’, the band’s stated aim for the cover of their debut was to &#8216;show that women could be sexy without dressing in a prescribed way. Sexy, in a natural way, and naked, without being pornographic&#8217;. Their bassist Tessa Pollitt described the cover as ‘one of the most liberating things I have done’, claiming that the band were ‘celebrating the freedoms we were creating’. The cover divided opinion at the time of its release, dismissed by some as a cynically sexualized ploy, and ridiculed by others because of the group’s deviation from a conventionally desirable body shape (Smith’s photographs were taken at a point when the Slits had succumbed to the regular eating and sleeping hours of studio life, away from the chaotic amphetamine-fuelled living to which they’d grown accustomed, leaving them looking softer and more rounded than expected by those policing punk angularity &#8211; a particularly frustrating slant of attack given punk’s early attempts to transcend these kind of prescriptive aesthetics).</p>
<p>Music writer Vivien Goldman embraced the <strong>Cut</strong> cover as a defiant reclamation of the female body, and Pauline Black, who went on to form 2-Tone band the Selecter, saw it as ‘so joyous, innocent and natural that it just seemed like a celebration of womanhood rather than any cheap titillation’. It still has the power to spark disagreement: Roni Sarig in <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29050.The_Secret_History_of_Rock"><strong>The Secret History Of Rock</strong></a> waxes lyrical that the cover ‘confounded notions of sexuality and civility and positioned the group as modern primitive feminist rebels &#8211; girls not afraid to be natural, sexual and formidable’, while the author of the <a href="http://www.punk77.co.uk/groups/slitsdiscography.htm">Punk77</a> website makes the counter-claim that the image in fact undermines Sarig’s idea ‘that they were one of the first all female bands to avoid being &#8216;marketed as sex objects&#8217;&#8230; They had their tits out. For instance I was 16 when this album came out&#8230; I and many others didn&#8217;t see it as anything but three nudes on a cover!’</p>
<h3>Bad Cover Versions</h3>
<p>As for the women-in-the-music-press discussion, so far so same-old. Cazz Blase&#8217;s <a href="http://www.thefword.org.uk/features/2012/02/women_and_the_music_press">recent article</a> on the UK music press maintained that it is marketed, sold and created primarily by and for men. The <strong>NME</strong>, which in 2009 appointed Krissi Murison as its first female editor, is actually not too bad as far as the balance of genders among its staff goes &#8211; although the relative positions women occupy, and how this translates to coverage and presentation of female musicians, are different debates. In 2010, Aoife Barry gave <a href="http://www.theantiroom.com/2010/11/16/what-the-boys-said-gender-imbalance-in-music-magazines/">an overview</a> of the underrepresentation of female musicians on the covers of music magazines, emphasizing the egregiousness of Q in particular:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why not count how many women you can see on the covers of <strong>Q</strong> magazine this year (two solo covers: Cheryl Cole and Lady Gaga – and two group shots: Amy Winehouse and Lily Allen together in a group shot; and Lady Gaga again in a group shot). The reason I mention <strong>Q</strong> is that the response to ‘there aren’t enough women on the covers of music magazines’ is often ‘but that’s because it reflects the amount of women working in music&#8217;. This is not true – particularly in the case of <strong>Q</strong>, which covers mainstream rock, indie and pop music. In fact, the female musicians it covers are usually from the pop arena. And you cannot argue that the pop realm is oestrogen-free.</p></blockquote>
<p>While, as Barry admits, ‘there may not be a great conspiracy to keep women off the covers of music magazines and give them minimal coverage on the inside pages’, it is frequently the case that when women are featured, so is a latent or overt sexualizing of them which does not affect their male counterparts to the same degree.</p>
<p>One has to factor in, of course, the degree to which coverage of bands will depend upon commercial trends in rock and indie; the musical greywash which occurred under late Britpop saw a sidelining of female artists which appeared to reach its dull conclusion in the post-Libertines profusion of almost invariably male ‘landfill indie’ groups. This connection is made explicit in <strong>Q</strong>’s concern with catering for a target demographic supposedly ‘inspired by the rock&#8217;n&#8217;roll swagger of Liam, Noel, Blur and the whole Britpop scene’, a remit which perhaps explains last October’s <a href="http://covers.q4music.com/Item.aspx?pageNo=6179&amp;year=2011">gobsmackingly retrograde</a> Kasabian cover while doing little to excuse it.</p>
<h3>Covering Up?</h3>
<p>Smith’s shot of the Slits in all their unphotoshopped glory differs from <strong>Q</strong>&#8216;s cover in several obvious respects – its subjects muddy rather than glossy, wearing unselfconscious grins rather than careful high-maintenance pouts, and, crucially, having shaped the image via their own concept and direction rather than following a top-down marketing or editorial strategy. It’s true that the NME has never been an impregnable bastion of women&#8217;s liberation – even on that Slits cover, there’s the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_Three">dubious </a>strapline referring to them as the paper’s ‘Page One girls’ – and I&#8217;m sure that just as many readers saw the cover as wank material as chin-strokingly believed it to be &#8216;confounding notions of sexuality and civility&#8217;. A happy few may even have done both. But the upfront disheveled self-confidence the Slits display is still striking and even looks quaint in an era where the last comparable Empowered and Liberated woman on an <strong>NME</strong> cover was, who, Beth Ditto? Whose appearance, and the ensuing <a href="http://www.bigfatblog.com/beth-ditto-cover-nme">debates</a> on whether it constituted &#8217;empowerment&#8217; or &#8216;objectification&#8217;, proved that non-standard naked women were still controversial in 2007.</p>
<p>Cazz Blaze, citing the music press’ recession-induced drift towards conservatism, characterized by an increasing reliance on sponsorship and advertising, predicts little room for improvement in opportunities for women to express their emancipation rather than their objectification. Her characterization of online music publications like <a href="http://thequietus.com/">The Quietus</a> as more conscientious about women as artists, readers, and writers, is an interesting point. It ties in with the idea of the internet as a space where female engagement with music can be expressed and explored without being dismissed as exclusively sex-centred or derided as juvenile inanity, and where female musicians themselves can harness the internet’s capacity for unregulated self-expression and audience interaction, <a href="http://wearsthetrousers.com/2008/11/outraged-amanda-palmer-fans-mount-rebellyon/">frequently</a> in ways which circumvent or combat industry and media-led imperatives on how women are meant to appear.</p>
<p>Despite the internet’s progressive potential for allowing female artists control over their own presentation, the reception of and reaction to that presentation remains beyond their control. After punk, and after riot grrl, the jury is still out on the political uses of the naked female form, and on their degree of effectiveness. Do images like those of Ditto and the Slits deconstruct and demystify the female body? How constructively do they inform debates on body image and female sexuality? In the eyes of observers male and female, are they validating alternative ways of being attractive, or are they merely putting forward an alternative cut of meat?</p>
<p>And, of course, should we be concerned at all with how a musician looks as opposed to how she &#8211; or he &#8211; sounds?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oh, this one is a doozy.</p>
<p>I wanted to include it because the responses I&#8217;ve been getting to it have been quite wide ranging. So, the story begins with that bastion of the High Street Sex Shops, <strong>Ann Summers</strong>, of whom I have always been reasonably supportive, despite their addiction to itchy lace and the colour pink.<br />

<p>Why do I like them? Because in a world where sex, especially female participation and enjoyment is still taboo, this is a store that unashamedly caters to women and makes sex toys understandable, fun and available.</p>
<p>Together with the revolutionary Ann Summers parties, which are still going today, it provides safe adult sexual education away from schools or the XXX signage of the sleazy, intimidating stores of old. You can still find those stores in some parts of Soho, if you fancy something retro. Pack your own mac.</p>
<h3>I love Lucy!</h3>
<p>Anyway, Ann Summers ran a modelling competion, and now their windows are full of the image above. The winner, in the middle, is <a href="http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/news/lucy_s_the_next_top_model_after_winning_national_competition_1_3413397">Lucy from Portsmouth</a>. The vote was public and Lucy secured enough votes from whoever votes in public modelling competitions. The general public, I guess, which means that the general public have a very different, and arguably more representational, view of what a sexy woman looks like compared with the usual imagery.</p>
<p>I like the fact that Lucy is a size 16 (<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/average-dress-size-of-women-increases-to-14-715277.html">I believe that would be just about an &#8216;average&#8217; size, right?</a>). I like that she has won something she wants to win, that she is smiling and happy and confident. Part of feminism is about being able to look sexy and to enjoy looking sexy &#8211; without being called a slut, and without feeling as if you need to starve yourself to death. In which case, hurrah for Lucy!</p>
<h3>I don&#8217;t know whether I love Lucy, I&#8217;m conflicted!</h3>
<p>But part of me, perhaps a churlish and mean spirited part, wishes she&#8217;d won something else. Something where she kept her clothes on. Something that wasn&#8217;t about a narrow definiton of sexiness as standing around in red and black underwear for men to gawp at you.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t like the idea of model competitions full stop &#8211; the whole idea that there are winners and losers in a world of body standards. There are too many women, too many shapes of their bodies, for there to be &#8216;correct&#8217; ones. Sexiness isn&#8217;t about size. And this makes it about size. It makes it about &#8220;skinny&#8221; and &#8220;fat&#8221; &#8211; which is <a href="http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2012/01/25/the-marilyn-meme/">that Marilyn meme</a> all over again, frankly.</p>
<h3>Maybe I do love Lucy!</h3>
<p>Yet there she is. On the high street. In a shop which is for women. And most of the women I talked to about this thought it was amazing, and when I put my objections about the sexualisation of women to them, they pointed out that this was Ann Summers, which is a sex shop, dammit, and that it was like me complaining that there were chocolates in Thorntons. They had a point. As did all of my friends who <em>do</em> like sexy, lacy (even pink) underwear.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know, I really don&#8217;t. Over to you&#8230;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[During the Eighties, there was a Fitness Craze among the baby-boomers. Watching the vids now, it's a bit like bearing witness to a maenadic ritual. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The followers of Dionysus were called the Maenads &#8211; the &#8216;raving ones&#8217;. During worship, and through a combination of alcohol and ritualistic dancing, Dionysus would inspire in these women a state of ecstatic frenzy. So inspired, they would roam in a state of madness, engaging in uncontrolled sexual behaviour, tearing apart animals (and sometimes humans) with their bare hands and devouring the raw flesh.</em></p>
<h3>And so into the Eighties&#8230;</h3>
<p>During the Eighties, there was a Fitness Craze among the baby-boomers, who &#8216;<a href="http://eightiesclub.tripod.com/id314.htm">from trying to improve society, [in the 60s and 70s&#8230;] turned to improving themselves</a>&#8216;. There can be no more evocative symbol of this than Jane Fonda and her striped leotard, although hers was a <a href="http://goretro.blogspot.com/2011/09/80s-fitness-craze.html">comparatively straight-edge style compared to some</a>.  Let&#8217;s pause to take a look at the opening to <strong>Jane Fonda&#8217;s Workout</strong> (released in 1982). It looks a little bit like a dark and threatening Exercise Cult. Even the music is vaguely sinister:</p>
<p><iframe width="480" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Nu7c9H6ngLI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>It feels a bit like that to do the workout. Jane ain&#8217;t taking no crap, and the video is punctuated with whoops of enthusiasm and the occasional yelp of pain from her exercise minions &#8211; one of whom, Leslie, is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HU1FUzrM3Fs">even invited down front to sing Jane&#8217;s very own personal song</a>, &#8216;Do It&#8217;. Leslie appeared in a few more of Fonda&#8217;s workout videos, unlike the <a href="http://www.videotapeswapshop.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/NICE-BEARD-tile.jpg">the guy in the crop top who looks uncannily like Steve Carrell in </a><strong><a href="http://www.videotapeswapshop.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/NICE-BEARD-tile.jpg">The 40-Year-Old Virgin</a></strong>. (Alas, there is no YouTube evidence that this guy ever existed, bar a fuzzy image in the video above, so the latter link &#8211; with its excellent headgear &#8211; will have to suffice.)</p>

<p>Speaking of that dude, I&#8217;ve never understood if the men in the back row are there as misguided eye candy while you sweat it out, or if they&#8217;re intended to demonstrate that the workout is suitable for all genders. Have a think about that one.</p>
</div>
<h3>Do It Yourself</h3>
<p>The &#8216;New Workout&#8217; was the first of 23 workout videos Fonda released and, apparently, the best-selling home video ever made (17 million copies sold). It&#8217;s hardly surprising: the DIY formula was a seductive one for (in particular) many American baby-boomer housewives, who were just beginning to own the new and exciting VCR-machine. Indeed, this exercise-at-home option contrasts curiously with these housewives&#8217; stereotypical Victorian counterparts, all <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/10/18/an-alphabet-of-femininism-3-c-is-for-crinoline/">inactivity, crinolines and restrictive corsets</a>. Fashion follows money, so the trophy wives of the 1980s would be as likely to flaunt their husbands&#8217; wealth with lycra, fitness gadgets and gyms as elegant laziness; keeping trim between cleaning the house and nuking something for dinner.</p>
<p>Another explanation is the quality of the workout itself: there&#8217;s a pleasing sense of female camaraderie on Jane&#8217;s workouts &#8211; she&#8217;s occasionally ironic, and consistently determined that you should smile while you do your umpteenth set of sit ups (I never knew it was possible for your abs to hurt post-workout, but I was ignorant). At peak moments she shouts &#8216;Come on! If I can do it, you can do it!&#8217;, apparently forgetting that she trained as a professional ballet dancer, whereas we, her viewers, are more likely to be professional slobs. She believes in you!</p>
<h3>Running Wild</h3>
<p>That said, she&#8217;s also MAD &#8211; look at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOYihkG3PEQ&amp;feature=related">the &#8216;cool down&#8217; section</a> of the &#8216;Advanced&#8217; workout for evidence. Rumours that she was filming the video on a diet of espresso, ice cream and cocaine remain unconfirmed, but she&#8217;s certainly on some kind of drug, even if just adrenaline. She drives her mob onwards, onwards, always onwards, and I always think there&#8217;s something vaguely Maenadic about the hoots and howls of pain she elicits from her class.</p>
<p>However, looking at similar videos of the time it seems that such a frenzied approach to exercise was completely normal: in the Canadian TV series <strong>20-Minute Workout</strong> (1983-4), the instructions are shouted out by Bess &#8216;Aerobics Queen&#8217; Motta almost as parts of a ritualistic cowboy song. The overall effect is unsettling, if not completely hypnotic:</p>
<p><iframe width="480" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Zcnn8WOqo98" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s Bess again, in a slightly more extended <strong>Aerobicise</strong> opus (the original 1981 show, whence <strong>20-Minute Workout </strong>was a spin-off). For some reason, at this point she seems to require two versions of herself to work out with simultaneously. It gets very weird from about 2:40 onwards, at which point the line between &#8216;exercise-at-home cardio workout&#8217; and &#8216;strangely synchronised proto-American Apparel soft porn&#8217; becomes blurred to say the very least:</p>
<p><iframe width="480" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/DeD9LSvYJgA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Both these are filmed with a pizazz lacking in Jane Fonda&#8217;s no-nonsense camerawork and they perhaps explain why, though Bess may have been Aerobics Queen, Jane was the housewives&#8217; favourite. These are so lacking in practicality that they&#8217;re almost music videos; and indeed there&#8217;s a &#8216;genuine&#8217; Sexy Workout prototype to compare them with, in the shape of Olivia Newton-John&#8217;s 80s cult classic &#8216;<strong>(Let&#8217;s Get) Physical</strong>&#8216; (1981).</p>
<p><iframe width="480" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/vWz9VN40nCA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Here, with a crazed energy akin to Fonda&#8217;s &#8211; but a sexual energy that&#8217;s more Bess Motta &#8211; Olivia Newton-John stalks a gym in something suspiciously akin to a thong-leotard. She pushes fat blokes around until they become ripped blokes shining with sweat (who then walk off into the changing rooms hand-in-hand&#8230;) &#8211; yet, ironically, the video was set in a gym in order to pacify hand-wringers who found the title too sexual.</p>
<p>Thematically and choreographically, this is almost an inverted reworking of the song 1950s icon Jane Russell sings to the US Olympic team in <strong>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes</strong>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m not in condition to wrestle<br />
I&#8217;ve never trained in a gym<br />
Show me a man who can nestle<br />
And I&#8217;ll pin a medal on him</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>Jane Russell, Ain&#8217;t there Anyone Here for Love?</strong> (1953)</p></blockquote>
<p><iframe width="480" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/IT1vDaf7RwA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Here, again, the woman is a kind of Exercise Divinity (note the Greek reference in the murals!), but not yet the Olivia NJ-style fitness dominatrix, just a sexy slavering (and physically passive) male muscle-fan.</p>
<h3>The Maenads Today</h3>
<p>Many modern exercise videos start from celebrity and work back (Kerry Katona, Davina McCall), but they seem to set out to strip their celebrity fitness instructors of all trace of the divine: Davina (whilst being instructed by a mysterious <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRRU4s_5qZc">woman sitting cross-legged in full gym kit just behind her</a>) howls at the exercises (&#8216;They&#8217;re really hard!!&#8217;), while Katie Price/Jordan&#8217;s 2005 effort <strong>The Jordan Workout</strong> is full of &#8216;I&#8217;m shattered!&#8217;, although I somehow doubt working out was the main intention of this particular video, given what Jordan is wearing:</p>
<p><iframe width="480" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/W8biUsrcRF4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting that the camaraderie is still there, but the star is no longer the instructor: instead, you&#8217;re &#8216;sharing&#8217; the star&#8217;s expensive personal trainer for the price of a DVD. Perhaps as a result, whereas Jane and Bess are driving you on to &#8216;better yourself&#8217; (we&#8217;ll leave the body fascism issue at the door for brevity&#8217;s sake), Jordan and Davina are much more prosaic about the whole thing. They even feel the need to give you a context for their workout: we learn that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxfZ1gRBxk">Jordan made her video because she wanted to be &#8216;back in her g-string and on the beach as Mrs Andre in just twelve weeks&#8217;</a>. And look at how the sex appeal has changed: it&#8217;s gone from a kind of primordial Dionysian cult to a bit of a cheeky snigger at Jordan&#8217;s knickers.</p>
<p>Conclusions &#8211; well, there are strange intersections here between sexuality, female camaraderie and the drive towards fitness. Personally, I reckon Jane&#8217;s still the best &#8211; and let&#8217;s not forget she also has an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Fonda">excellent political record</a> &#8211; but I will leave you with this video, made in 1983 by Debbie Reynolds (of <strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fzPf8GL0mw">Singin&#8217; in the Rain</a></strong> fame): <strong>Do It Debbie&#8217;s Way</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Do It Debbie&#8217;s Way (1983)</strong>.</p>
<p><iframe width="480" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/I-g2YQ9HgOM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The next time I&#8217;m fed up down the gym, I am going to fling the dumbbells down in disgust and flounce off, offering as explanation merely: &#8216;I spent years at MGM making musicals! This is the lousiest exercise I eveeeer haaaad!!!!&#8217;</p>
