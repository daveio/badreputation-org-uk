					<description><![CDATA[A lil' competition for the gamers in our readerbase! ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>July has been very empty on my playing schedule.  Moving house &#8211; all those <em>boxes</em> &#8211; kinda took it out of me.  I&#8217;ve just been pottering on <a href="http://www.teamfortress.com"><strong>TF2</strong></a> and aside from that I finally finished <a href="http://www.ea.com/dead-space-2"><strong>Dead Space 2</strong></a> in one 3-hour stint.  I&#8217;m also on holiday from the end of July so, that&#8217;s put a deadline on things.  I thought to myself,<em> &#8220;What can I bring to Gamer Diary this month if I haven&#8217;t played anything?&#8221;</em> and then, while gormlessly starting at <strong>Steam</strong>, I had an idea: a competition!  So, at the end of this post there&#8217;ll be some details on how you could win one of the titles I&#8217;ve written about this year (via Steam).</p>
<p>First I&#8217;ll give you something of substance.</p>
<p>The posts I wrote last month (<a title="[Gamer Diary] From Indie Camaraderie to “Get back in the kitchen, slut!”: recent ups and downs of the internet gamingverse" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/07/05/gamer-diary-from-indie-camaraderie-to-get-back-in-the-kitchen-slut-the-ups-and-downs-of-the-internet-gaming-verse/">here</a> and <a title="[Gamer Diary] Rollercoaster June: an addendum" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/07/06/gamer-diary-rollercoaster-june-an-addendum/">here</a>) were somewhat laden with negativity &#8211; you could say legitimately &#8211; so I thought that for this offering I&#8217;d continue to talk about our gaming community and the relationship developers have with their audiences.  Most importantly, I&#8217;d like to highlight a couple of examples of those who are getting it right.  Or, at the very least &#8211; because no one can be perfect &#8211; who seem to be doing it better than others.</p>
<p>There are a lot of devs and publishers who have their plus points, and there are those that have their negatives.  Most have both, but some are more <em>memorable</em> for either one of these polar options.  For this post I&#8217;d like to look at the ones who are most famed for being a little bit awesome.</p>
<p>It being summer, those who know them will not be surprised that I&#8217;m going to bring up <strong>Valve</strong>.  During the <em>Meet the Pyro</em> update for <strong>Team Fortress 2</strong>, they announced the <strong>Source Filmmaker</strong>, and as the Summer Sale began, they announced <strong>Greenlight</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/source_filmmaker.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="11562" data-permalink="/2012/07/30/gamer-diary-what-ive-been-playing-july-2012-community-relations-and-a-competition/source_filmmaker/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/source_filmmaker.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="600,400" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Source Filmmaker" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/source_filmmaker.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/source_filmmaker.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignleft  wp-image-11562" title="Source Filmmaker" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/source_filmmaker.jpg?resize=360%2C240" alt="source filmmaker title screen - white lettering on black background with a gold film reel graphic" width="360" height="240" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/source_filmmaker.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/source_filmmaker.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>I jumped on <a title="Source Filmmaker" href="http://sourcefilmmaker.com/" target="_blank">Filmmaker</a> and have quite enjoyed playing with it.  Here&#8217;s my one-and-only even-vaguely-close-to-finished <a title="YouTube: Solider/Demo Showdown (wvelkala)" href="http://youtu.be/QN1asTKDaso" target="_blank">short I made</a>.  The tutorials started off simply enough but after a few of them, &#8216;Bay&#8217; (our guide) seems to dispense with the explaining-it-to-a-layperson format and just starts blurting jargon at you left, right and centre.  Hence why I haven&#8217;t finished the tutorial video yet. (That and the fact I got distracted with my little Western-style showdown there.)</p>
<p>One other criticism at this point is that the Store Page (on Steam) for the Filmmaker has a list of minimum system requirements, but not all of these are accurate.  The page lists that you need a minimum resolution of 1366 x 768, which I had, but this creates problems with displaying all the necessary functions of the tool.  I had to bump up to the &#8220;suggested&#8221; 1920 x 1080 in order to get full functionality out of it.  But, hey, it&#8217;s free, it&#8217;s pretty fun and is a great way to get involved in the community.</p>
<p>Now, <a title="Steam Greenlight" href="http://steamcommunity.com/greenlight/" target="_blank">Greenlight</a> is not something I expect to benefit from &#8211; as I&#8217;m not a developer &#8211; but I will definitely be checking it out from a voter&#8217;s perspective.  Here&#8217;s the basic premise: lots of games get submitted to Valve looking to be sold via Steam; they started to think maybe there was a better way of selecting games; having seen the success of the Workshop ratings system they thought of employing a similar thing for games; Greenlight allows developers to submit their games and be at the mercy of the community.  In theory, if the community likes your game(s), you get high ratings/votes, and your game gets to go to Steam and be sold through the client.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/greenligh_SOON.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="11561" data-permalink="/2012/07/30/gamer-diary-what-ive-been-playing-july-2012-community-relations-and-a-competition/greenligh_soon/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/greenligh_SOON.jpg?fit=949%2C211&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="949,211" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Steam Greenlight: Coming Soon" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/greenligh_SOON.jpg?fit=300%2C66&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/greenligh_SOON.jpg?fit=949%2C211&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-11561" title="Steam Greenlight: Coming Soon" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/greenligh_SOON.jpg?resize=531%2C118" alt="Title screen reading 'Greenlight: coming soon' in green on a black background" width="531" height="118" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/greenligh_SOON.jpg?w=949&amp;ssl=1 949w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/greenligh_SOON.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 531px) 100vw, 531px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a brilliant opportunity for a <em>lot</em> of smalltime and bedroom developers to get recognition for their work, to build a fanbase and maybe make some money out of their work.  So, Steam users of BadRep, get behind this!  When it arrives, let&#8217;s make sure we show Valve this is a good tool to help out the smalltimers.</p>
<h3>Competition Time!</h3>
<p>In celebration of a variety of things (Valve being awesome, &#8220;summer&#8221;, I&#8217;ve been at BR Towers over a year now&#8230;) I thought a little gaming giveaway would be nice.  As BR is voluntary, this is me buying prizes for you guys, so given that I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll understand why this competition happens to follow the Steam Summer Sale.</p>
<h3>Up for grabs:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Torchlight</strong> &#8211; as mentioned <a title="[Gamer Diary] What I’ve been playing… June 2012" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/07/12/gamer-diary-what-ive-been-playing-june-2012/" target="_blank">June&#8217;s &#8220;&#8230;Playing&#8221;</a> post.</li>
<li><strong>Bastion</strong> &#8211; also from June (see link above).</li>
<li><strong>LIMBO</strong> &#8211; recently part of Humble Bundle V (discussed <a title="[Gamer Diary] From Indie Camaraderie to “Get back in the kitchen, slut!”: recent ups and downs of the internet gamingverse" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/07/05/gamer-diary-from-indie-camaraderie-to-get-back-in-the-kitchen-slut-the-ups-and-downs-of-the-internet-gaming-verse/" target="_blank">here</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How to enter:</span></p>
<p>Leave a comment on this post (they do not automatically see the light of the internet so your details will only be seen by Team BadRep) and remember to include an email address linked to a Steam account or your Steam ID and which of the three games you&#8217;d prefer.</p>
<p>Early in August I&#8217;ll collect all the details, and using some funky random number generators to do some description of Name-out-of-the-Hat magic, I&#8217;ll then get in touch with winners to arrange the gifting of their new Steam game.</p>
<p>Simple as that, really.  Good luck!</p>
<p>But if you&#8217;re feeling generous, could you spare a couple of minutes <a title="SurveyMonkey: Can the consumer influence the creator?" href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/RX9V7ZY" target="_blank">to complete this little survey</a>?</p>

					<description><![CDATA[This June just gone, I’ve been having fun on a variety of games...]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This June just gone, I’ve been having fun on a variety of games &#8211; but that also means I haven’t finished any of them just yet.  Plus I’ve only had three weeks of the month to play before writing this as I’m moving home, so I expect some disruption.  Nevertheless, I can finally bring you comments on <strong>Assassin’s Creed: Revelations</strong> <em>(over 6 months after release &#8211; soz),</em> alongside <strong>Bastion</strong> from the <strong>Humble Bundle V</strong>, which, by the way, ended up with over $5,000,000 raised.  Also: <strong>Torchlight</strong> and some watching-over-my-partner’s-shoulder of <strong>Max Payne 3</strong> (for PC).</p>
<p>I’ve also had a bit of a <a href="http://www.tf2.com/"><strong>TF2</strong></a> revival this month, and that’s been fun, but what more can be said about TF2?  There are no female characters (yet), although there are plenty of female gamers.  I personally haven’t seen much SexistFail in chat but I know it does happen on some servers (you do, however, get a <em>lot</em> of childish insults and obscene ‘sprays’ on some servers).  It’s a fun, team-based game that’s F2P (Free2Play), and <strong>Valve</strong> just <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-18456171">hired an economist</a> to help with the ever expanding Mannconomy and the inter-game economies as they grow further still.  That’s interesting, right?  Plus <a title="Team Fortress: Pyromania" href="www.teamfortress.com/pyromania" target="_blank">PYROMANIA</a> has landed.</p>
<div id="attachment_11402" style="width: 264px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/120430_bastion.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11402" data-attachment-id="11402" data-permalink="/2012/07/12/gamer-diary-what-ive-been-playing-june-2012/120430_bastion/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/120430_bastion.jpg?fit=530%2C350&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="530,350" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Bastion" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/120430_bastion.jpg?fit=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/120430_bastion.jpg?fit=530%2C350&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11402 " title="Bastion" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/120430_bastion.jpg?resize=254%2C168" alt="Screengrab of The Kid from Bastion - small and wide-eyed with white-blond hair." width="254" height="168" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/120430_bastion.jpg?w=530&amp;ssl=1 530w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/120430_bastion.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 254px) 100vw, 254px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-11402" class="wp-caption-text">Bastion&#8217;s protag, &#8220;the Kid&#8221;, looking a bit moody.</p></div>
<p>To <a href="http://supergiantgames.com/?page_id=242"><strong>Bastion</strong></a>!  This is a very curious indie title that offers a considerable amount of play-time compared to other indie offerings.  It&#8217;s described as “<em>…an action role-playing experience that redefines storytelling in games, with a reactive narrator who marks your every move</em>”.  I’ve heard similar claims before and ended up disappointed, but <strong>Bastion</strong> really delivers on this concept.  Admittedly, the narrator’s voice does get on my nerves but it really does react to what you do.  I’m sure there’s an inventory of quips and comments that are selected according to specific trigger events in the game but it’s still pretty cool.</p>
<p>The art is lovely and it isn’t just the simple damsel-in-distress format that I have encountered in a lot of other indie titles (<strong>LIMBO</strong>, <strong>Braid</strong>, for example), which is a nice change of pace.  Although the main active characters are all male and the one female (so far) has been pretty passive, there’s still a good bit of joy to be taken from this game.  It’s simple enough to grasp and you can make it harder in a variety of ways, so for gameplay and originality it gets a thumbs-up from me.  Unfortunately, if you didn’t get lucky and snap up the Humble Bundle, <strong>Bastion</strong> as a standalone is <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/107100/">£11.49 on <strong>Steam</strong></a> but is currently going for under £9 on <a href="http://www.greenmangaming.com/s/gb/en/pc/games/rpgs/bastion/"><strong>Green Man Gaming</strong></a> (sort of an alternative to Steam).</p>
<p>The one last thing that I will mention about <strong>Bastion</strong> is the soundtrack, which is beautiful, and I bring this up because I also want to make a special note of <strong>Torchlight</strong>’s soundtrack.  While playing <strong>Torchlight</strong> I am constantly finding myself with the urge to go and watch <strong>Sunshine</strong> again.  This is because the generic background twinkling of <strong>Torchlight</strong> often hits some of the same chords or sequences that the piece <a href="http://youtu.be/NQXVzg2PiZw">‘Sunshine (Adagio in D Minor)’</a> features.  Now, that piece (composed by John Murphy) makes me all soft and wibbly on the inside every time I hear it.  As does watching <strong>Sunshine</strong>.  But, alas, ’tis presently packed in a box somewhere.</p>

<p>Music aside, <strong>Torchlight</strong> (yes, it’s 3 years old, sorry!) is a great little RPG offering.  I have it because I pre-ordered <a href="http://www.torchlight2game.com/"><strong>Torchlight II</strong></a> via Steam and got <strong>Torchlight</strong> to play with in the meantime.  <strong>Torchlight II</strong> is making some people in RPG land a bit excited after the numerous issues people have had with <strong>Diablo III</strong>.  The first game is charming, easy to use and offers some features bigger RPGs haven’t, such as sending your pet to town to sell items from your backpack – meaning you’ll end up with a huge surplus of Town Portal Scrolls as you never need to use them!  It does, regrettably, fall foul of the tediously standard female-armour-fail… <em>do all these women seriously have bullet/arrow/sword/magic proof tits and navels?</em>  That’s the only negative so far, but this looks like it might be halfway rectified, at least, in <strong>Torchlight II</strong>: go and check out the <a href="http://www.torchlight2game.com/classes">character classes</a> on their site <em>(only one of the 4 female figures has cleavage showing!)</em>.</p>
<p>Now for something released in 2012; I know, incredible, right? <strong> Max Payne 3</strong> has amazing visuals, even on low-spec PCs, and great mechanisms for exciting gameplay.  It showcases the new <strong>Rockstar</strong> engine that will be used in next year’s <strong>Grand Theft Auto V</strong>; not a franchise I’m fond of, but with this engine, it&#8217;ll look stunning and run spectacularly.  <strong>Max Payne 3</strong> has kept fairly faithful to the originals and the basic ‘essence’ of Max, which is a relief for the old fans, but offers plenty for those new to the series.</p>

<p>As an <em>observer </em>(not the sinister <strong>Fringe</strong> kind) to <strong>Max Payne</strong> it’s a little different to discuss than if I&#8217;d been the <em>player</em>.  I was hoping to get my partner to contribute something here, but the house-moving saga has put paid to that plan.  <strong>Max Payne</strong> does play with some damsel-in-distress themes and always has, but it also manages to twist them around.  Originally, Max becomes an avenging angel, fallen-from-grace figure after his wife and infant daughter are murdered.  He tears up NYC seeking revenge, but finds conspiracies abound, and then his moral compass takes over and he kills all the baddies.</p>
<p>In <strong>MP3</strong>, he’s given up being a cop and is playing the private security game.  Although the game starts out with the feel that Max is off saving, and I quote, “fallen women” all over again, it swiftly changes tack in the brutal underworld of Brazil and Max, in the middle of an identity crisis, isn’t sure whether he’s a good guy, a bad guy, or a magical pixie putting the world to rights.  I’m not sure if he ever really ‘finds himself’, but he shoots all the baddies and conquers another conspiracy in typical grim, noir style.  The combat mechanics set this game apart and offer a truly varied way of kickin’ ass.  As, I say, the graphics are gorgeous, the engine is shiny and the music is atmospheric (not to mention nostalgic) the whole way through.</p>

<p>Here I am, talking so much about music and mechanics, you thought I’d forgotten <strong>AC:Rev</strong>, didn’t you?  Well, let me squeeze it in now.  I have yet to complete the game because I&#8217;ve been purposefully dawdling in order to enjoy sandboxing in such a magnificent environment.  Constantinople looks great, and you get to train up your Assassins right from the get-go, as well as the usual bits and pieces around the city with added stalkers who occasionally try to stab you right when you’re supposed to be tailing someone.  The main storyline, so far, hasn’t been too riveting, which is a shame.  I’m sure &#8211; after I’ve finished unpacking &#8211; that I’ll charge through the story and update you all next month.</p>
<p>What else can you expect in July’s end-of-month post?  I’ve got a couple of new games to play with (actually new, i.e. newly released!) and I’m always keeping an eye out for things to play, but summer tends to be time for the blockbuster films until autumn brings gaming back into focus again&#8230;</p>
