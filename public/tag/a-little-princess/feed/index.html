<h6 style="text-align: center;">D</h6>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">DOLL</h2>
<blockquote><p>What fascinated Ermengarde the most was [Sara&#8217;s] fancy about the dolls who walked and talked, and who could do anything they chose when the human beings were out of the room, but who must keep their powers a secret and so flew back to their places &#8216;like lightening&#8217; when people returned to the room.</p>
<p>&#8211; Francis Hodgson Burnett, &#8216;A Little Princess&#8217;</p></blockquote>
<h3>Were he not Romeo called&#8230;</h3>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbie">Barbara Millicent Roberts</a> is actually, it turns out, called Dorothy. At least, a &#8216;Barbie doll&#8217; is a tautology, since the word &#8216;doll&#8217; itself was originally a nickname. (Rs and Ls are colloquially interchangeable, donchaknow &#8211; see also Harry/Hal, Mary/Moll.)</p>
<p>&#8216;Doll&#8217; as a name makes an early debut in renaissance drama: first as Doll Tearsheet in Shakespeare&#8217;s <strong>Henry IV</strong> and then as Doll Common in Jonson&#8217;s <strong>The Alchemist</strong>. These two draw in &#8216;Doll&#8217;s&#8217; second meaning, which assumes a &#8216;Dorothy&#8217; is so common a species as to be generic. Thus, &#8216;Doll&#8217; as a pet name is quickly expanded to indicate any female &#8216;pet&#8217;, or indeed any female &#8216;mistress&#8217; (drawing confused attention to the potentially infantalising properties of nicknames in general). Additionally, as of 1560, it could also be used to mean &#8216;the smallest or pet pig in the litter&#8217; (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte's_Web">like Wilbur</a>). But clearly there is a double edge to Dorothy&#8217;s common-ness, since &#8216;common&#8217; means &#8216;for the use of everyone&#8217; (tee hee) as well as &#8216;numerous&#8217; – something Doll Common&#8217;s character demonstrates nominally. ENTER THE PROSTITUTE.</p>
<h3>Work and Play</h3>
<p>It is only in 1700 that &#8216;Doll&#8217; loses its capital letter and acquires something of its modern sense. The dictionary defines this as &#8216;an image of a human being (commonly of a child or lady) used as a plaything; a girl&#8217;s toy-baby&#8217;. It is no longer a name, but it still stands in for something else, with a more spiritual implication in dear Shakespeare&#8217;s <strong>Romeo and Juliet</strong> (that name-obsessed play). Here, Old Capulet refers to his daughter as a &#8216;whining Mammet&#8217;, a deviant form of &#8216;Maumet&#8217; which, deriving ultimately from &#8216;Mohammed&#8217;, was a term used in medieval England to mean &#8216;a puppet, an idol, a doll&#8217;. Here lurks the second commandment, in all its thorny glory, giving an added layer to Barbie&#8217;s iconicism, not to mention the groom&#8217;s pledge to his bride in the traditional Marriage Service, &#8216;With my body I thee worship&#8217;. (I hear the clatter of toppling pedestals.)</p>

<p>It is, I must NB, definitionally <em>girls </em>who play with dolls, and there is a pleasing juxtaposition of frivolous and stern in the dictionary&#8217;s reference to &#8216;playthings&#8217; &#8230; but I cannot help but suspect that, in their initial incarnation, these &#8216;doll-babies&#8217; were occasionally also educational tools, teaching the virtues of maternal care for something smaller and weaker, sartorial elegance and grooming and presumably also some degree of etiquette – these dolls could, after all, represent all ages, and I suspect that the comparative decline of the over 18s represented in modern doll-land may also signal a movement from dolls as work to dolls as play. (Incidentally, Londoners: for more on toys&#8217; super-seriousness, go have a look at the Maritime Museum&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nmm.ac.uk/visit/exhibitions/on-display/toy-boats/">Toy Boats exhibition</a> for examples of boys&#8217; toys serving to illustrate German naval supremacy). But onwards.</p>
<p>From play to work, there&#8217;s a beautiful reference in the dictionary to &#8216;doll&#8217; used in the more modern sense when, in 1860, the journal <em>All Year Round</em> talks about the &#8216;laborious class Who earn painful bread by fashioning dolls&#8217; eyes&#8217;, which tellingly hints at the expanded manufacturing operations doll-craft represented by the mid-Victorian industrialised era – a far cry from what would presumably have been an ad-hoc domestic craft when &#8216;doll-babies&#8217; first became popular. <strong>A Little Princess</strong>, quoted above, is a story obsessed with the power of make-believe and dolls as synecdoches for real-life figures.  It features multiple references to the late-Victorian doll and the materialism she represents, including the disapproval of Sara Crewe&#8217;s family solicitor, who, on seeing what Sara dubs &#8216;The Last Doll&#8217; says sternly &#8216;A hundred pounds [&#8230;] All expensive material, and made at a Parisian modiste&#8217;s. He spent money lavishly enough, that young man&#8217;. Fans of Victorian women&#8217;s studies may think of Dickens&#8217; Mr Merdle (<em>Little Dorrit</em>) and his search, not for a wife, but for &#8216;a bosom to hang jewels upon&#8217;.</p>
<h3>Living Dolls</h3>
<p>It has taken more time than usual, but finally the leximobile screeches up outside definition number three, another Victorian usage, &#8216;doll&#8217; as &#8216;a pretty, but unintelligent or empty person&#8217;, especially, the dictionary adds, &#8216;when dressed up; also, a pretty but silly or frivolous woman&#8217;. Hence we have &#8216;a doll&#8217;s face&#8217;, which is one &#8216;conventionally pretty, but without life or expression&#8217;. Pleasingly, in this instance, it is the lifeless image of womanhood that inspires the pejorative reference to the real thing, rather than the other way round, although it gives rise to a disturbing number of aspirations in the sentient race to be &#8216;living dolls&#8217; (a quick google, and you&#8217;ll see what I mean). The dictionary even has names for this sort of thing, giving a delightful number of compound terms: thus the (tautological) worship of dolls &#8211; <em>dollatry</em>, <em>dollhood</em> – the state or condition of being like a doll, <em>dollship</em> – the personality of a doll, although it also points out that these relate primarily to &#8216;doll&#8217;s&#8217; fifth meaning, via a re-emerging &#8216;Doll Common&#8217;, as &#8216;a prostitute&#8217;. &#8216;Living dolls&#8217; may in fact also be real-life Ladies Of Easy Virtue.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8216;</em>There is much for her to do, her whole sex to deliver from the bondage of frivolity, dolldom and imbecility.&#8217;</p>
<p>-Thomas Carlyle (1795-1881), &#8216;Letters&#8217;, (undated)</p></blockquote>
<p>So, from &#8216;Dorothy&#8217; onwards, a &#8216;doll&#8217; always represents something bigger, be it a name whose full gravity cannot yet be properly appropriated, a world of humans made more comprehensible for a small child, or even a religious figure incarnated in sacrilegious form. It is the idolatry of such a representation that I find most fascinating: it gives a whole new irony to Sara Crewe&#8217;s repeated assertion that, as her father has always told her, &#8216;All women are princesses.&#8217;</p>
