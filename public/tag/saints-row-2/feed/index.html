										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been a mixed bag for representations of women in the world of computer games releases. In the <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=woot">woot!</a> corner, we have the much-anticipated arrival of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_2"><strong>Portal 2</strong></a>. The original <strong>Portal</strong> garnered a lot of press, not only because it was a lot of fun to play, but because it challenged a lot of notions about the FPS (first person shooter) genre.<a href="http://www.gamesradar.com/xbox360/f/portal-is-the-most-subversive-game-ever/a-20071207115329881080/g-2006071916221774024"> There&#8217;s a nice, if rather Freudian analysis of the first game here</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_5974" style="width: 234px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/portal-2-chell.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5974" data-attachment-id="5974" data-permalink="/2011/06/13/found-feminism-portal-2-and-saints-row-2-but-not-brink/portal-2-chell/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/portal-2-chell.jpg?fit=640%2C856&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="640,856" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Chell the character you play in Portal 2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/portal-2-chell.jpg?fit=224%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/portal-2-chell.jpg?fit=640%2C856&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-5974" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/portal-2-chell-224x300.jpg?resize=224%2C300" alt="A white, dark-haired female character, in an orange jumpsuit and vest top, runs forwards" width="224" height="300" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/portal-2-chell.jpg?w=224&amp;ssl=1 224w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/portal-2-chell.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w" sizes="(max-width: 224px) 100vw, 224px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-5974" class="wp-caption-text">Chell, the character you play in Portal 2</p></div>
<p>Whether or not you agree in full with that critique,<strong> Portal</strong> is different, even down to the attitudes its game designers have towards<a href="http://www.fpstime.com/2011/02/portal-2-whos-chell/"> designing the female avatar</a>.</p>
<p>We can certainly look at this new arrival as a continuation of gaming house <strong>Valve Corporation</strong>&#8216;s pleasing two feminist fingers up to traditional notions of male-centric gaming.</p>
<p>Speaking of traditional notions, in the Epic Fail corner we have <a href="http://www.brinkthegame.com/gate/?request=%2F"><strong>Brink</strong></a>, which was also hailed as being a revolutionary, life-will-never-be-the-same-again game. Which it might well be, on some fronts, and as far as I can tell, it is a pretty cool shooty-killy game. But then, I like guns and explosions. However, woe unto those who cry &#8220;awesome&#8221;, because one of the main selling points of<strong> Brink</strong> is that the dollmaker (the widget that lets you select how your character looks) has literally millions of variants, so many that the internet has <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=options+for+brink+character+creation&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&amp;client=firefox-a#sclient=psy&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB%3Aofficial&amp;source=hp&amp;q=brink+character+creation&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&amp;fp=eb847c1bda400d6d&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=657">spawned tons of webpages</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv0d2VfoAE4">YouTube vids</a> helping you through this process. And yet, <em>none of these options are female</em>. Cue a variety of opinions on the Internet as to <a href="http://www.gamecritics.com/brad-gallaway/brink-no-girls-allowed">whether this is actually important</a>.</p>
<p>Naturally, I think it is, and if we want to chuck hard facts into the argument, let&#8217;s remember that under-representation of women is rife in almost all walks of life and serves as a discouragement to other women from participating, thus continuing the gendered ghetto. The gaming world is an interesting one because whilst men do outnumber women in terms of time spent playing computer games, around <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=1659">a third of game players are female</a>.  Which is quite a lot, really. I often wonder how many more women would enjoy them if there were more games that had a more inclusive idea of gender. And, as if in answer to my musings, along comes a good example from 2006 sent in by our own Rob, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saints_Row_2"><strong>Saints Row 2</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Now, a <a href="http://www.saintsrow.com/age-gate/enter?destination=node%2F45542">game franchise based on gangster culture</a> is not the most likely source of this Found Feminism, and the website does not scream &#8220;we&#8217;ve totally got our gender issues sorted!&#8221; at me, but hold onto your controllers kids, because Rob has pinged me over some screen grabs from the dollmaker which make for interesting viewing.</p>

<p>The sliders shown to the left of the character (the second image enlarges if you click) allow you to toggle a  number of variables, including muscle, fat, age and skin tone, which effectively lets you make characters who look far from the basic stereotype hypermasculine and hyperfeminine models so common in games. Of course, you can still be Mr Abs and Ms Double G should you so wish, but the important thing is that the option to NOT do this is there.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s rather the point of this Found Feminism, and one of the reasons I am a feminist. I am not up in arms because the representations of women in computer games are of beautiful sexy assassins, it&#8217;s because<a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/01/19/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-the-frank-miller-effect-strikes-again/"> there is so rarely an option to be anything else</a>. Which means that when a few games come along that push against those barriers, we should applaud the makers and encourage them to do more. And perhaps one day the promised cake of gaming gender equality <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-cake-is-a-lie--5#.TevU8FuqjSs">will no longer be a lie</a>.</p>
