<li>&#8220;Athleticism in women has generated social unease going back at least as far as the Greek myth of Atalanta&#8221;: Amanda Marcotte for the American Prospect, in a piece titled <a href="http://prospect.org/article/olympic-girls-go-bad-boy">Olympic Girls Go Bad-Boy</a>.</li>

<li>&#8220;Women have struggled to find a &#8216;home&#8217; in this sport for decades, and the struggle doesn’t end with this momentous occasion. However, becoming an Olympic sport does help to legitimize what many of us have known for years: women can box.&#8221; &#8211;  <a href="http://www.boxing.com/womens_olympic_boxing_2012_history_in_the_making.html">Women&#8217;s Olympic Boxing 2012: History in the Making</a> (boxing.com).

					<description><![CDATA[You want to hear about more awesomeness? Try Wilma Rudolph, Olympic hero!  ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Winning is great, sure, but if you are really going to do something in life, the secret is learning how to lose. Nobody goes undefeated all the time. If you can pick up after a crushing defeat, and go on to win again, you are going to be a champion someday.</p>
<p>– <strong>Wilma Rudolph</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The 1960 Summer Olympics, the first to be broadcast internationally (the 1948 games had been aired by the BBC, but only in London), helped launch the fame of one of the world’s best known athletes, Cassius Clay. But this post is about someone else who competed that year: the woman who would become known as “the Tornado” and “La Gazella Negra”, Wilma Glodean Rudolph (June 23, 1940 – November 12 1994).</p>
<p>Rudolph was not the most likely choice to become one of the best runners of her generation. The 20th in a family of 22 children, she was a premature birth, weighing only 4.5lbs. Racial segregation in the US at the time prevented Wilma from being treated at the local hospital, and the poverty caused by the Great Depression made it financially difficult for her family to take her elsewhere. Throughout her childhood her mother had to nurse her through measles, mumps, scarlet fever, whooping cough, chickenpox, and pneumonia.</p>
<p>The disease that had the most impact on her chances of athletic stardom, however, was polio, which left her partially paralysed and with a twisted left leg. It seemed unlikely that she would be able to walk again, let alone run. Wilma, however, was far too tenacious to be slowed down by a little thing like polio and childhood paralysis. Through a combination of intense physical therapy, corrective shoes, and a metal leg brace, Wilma regained the ability to walk unaided by the age of twelve.</p>
<blockquote><p>My doctor told me I would never walk again. My mother told me I would. I believed my mother.</p>
<p>– <strong>Wilma Rudolph</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>No stranger to physical training by this point, Wilma decided to follow in the path of one of her older sisters and take up basketball. She excelled at the sport, setting state records for scoring, and catching the attention of Edward Temple &#8211; the track and field coach for Tennessee State University. She had some track experience already from high school athletics classes, and by 1956, aged 16, she was running to a high enough standard to have a spot on the US Olympic team for the 1956 games in Melbourne, where she picked up a bronze medal.</p>
<p>Four years beforehand she’d been unable to walk unaided, and four years before that she was being told by doctors that she’d never walk at all. Now she was an Olympic medallist. Of course, someone who overcomes polio through sheer determination isn’t the sort of person who settles for a mere bronze medal. In 1960 Wilma returned to the Olympics for the Rome games and landed no less than three gold medals, the first American woman to do so. She set a world record for the 200m sprint at 23.2 seconds, and one for the 400m relay with her teammates <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Hudson">Martha Hudson</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucinda_Williams_%28athlete%29">Lucinda Williams</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Jones_%28athlete%29">Barbara Jones</a>.</p>

Upon returning to Clarksville, Tennessee, with her medals, a homecoming parade was arranged in her honour. She insisted the parade be an integrated event, where previous such occasions had always been segregated. Her banquet was the first time in the city’s history that a large meal was held without segregation. After this, Wilma joined the protests that took place in the city until segregation laws were struck down.</p>
<p>You want to hear about more awesomeness? Hopefully you do, because Wilma Rudolph still had plenty more of it to deliver. Her athletic excellence had earned her a full scholarship at Tennessee State University, you see, where she earned a bachelor’s degree in education. She taught for a while at her own former high school, followed by schools in Maine and Indiana. In 1967 she was asked by the then Vice President of the US, Hubert Humphrey, to take part in an athletic outreach programme aimed at underprivileged children living in housing projects in several major cities. When the programme ended she established her own non-profit organisation, the Wilma Rudolph Foundation, to continue the work. The foundation provided free coaching, academic assistance and personal support to kids in deprived areas.</p>
<blockquote><p>The triumph can&#8217;t be had without the struggle. And I know what struggle is. I have spent a lifetime trying to share what it has meant to be a woman first in the world of sports so that other young women have a chance to reach their dreams.</p>
<p>– <strong>Wilma Rudolph</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>For more detailed discussion on Wilma Rudolph’s athletic achievements and work as an educator and civil rights campaigner, check out <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Wilma-Rudolph-Educator-Ferguson-Biographies/dp/0894343564/"><strong>Wilma Rudolph: Athlete and Educator</strong></a> by Alice Flanagan, and the good but somewhat short <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Wilma-Unlimited-Rudolph-Became-Fastest/dp/0152020985/"><strong>Wilma Unlimited</strong></a> by Kathleen Krull. Wilma’s 1977 autobiography, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Wilma-Rudolph/dp/0451099389/"><strong>Wilma</strong></a>, is also good, but a bit tricky to find.</p>
