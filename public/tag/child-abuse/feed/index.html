										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is an international organisation which protects abused children in a unique way.<br />
The alpha-masculinity of the men is honourable and has a positive effect on the community.<br />
The women in it are equals, fully involved in the work of being a physically intimidating deterrent.</p>
<p>Oh yes, and it&#8217;s a biker gang.</p>
<p>The Arizona website <strong>AZCentral.com</strong> recently published <A href="http://www.azcentral.com/news/azliving/articles/2012/07/13/20120713bikers-against-child-abuse-make-abuse-victims-feel-safe.html" target="_blank">this story about <strong>BACA &#8211; Bikers Against Child Abuse</strong></a>. The theory behind the group is simple, and works very well: if an abused child is scared of their attacker returning, if their home no longer feels like a safe haven, or if the outside world and school feel too exposed, their new family will stand guard for as long as they need.</p>
<p><em>(Warning &#8211; you should definitely read the whole article, but if you do there is a high chance you will cry your eyes out and have your faith in humanity restored. As the comments put it: &#8220;How come ninjas are cutting onions in my living room?&#8221; &#8220;Ahh they&#8217;re at my office too!&#8221; Not too triggery except in the general discussion of the topic.)</em></p>

John Paul Lilly realised that the 8-year-old boy in his care was too scared to leave the house, and remembered what had successfully taken away his own fears as a child: having a biker gang look out for him. He developed safeguards and checks to make the idea work in a therapeutic environment, and now there are chapters in the United States, Canada, Australia, Italy, The Netherlands and Belgium. The details of precisely what they do are extraordinary.</p>
<p>First of all, the child meets the whole local gang and becomes part of their family. They get the same t-shirt as the gang. They get a biker name. They are under no doubt that these men and women will be there for them from now on. For the bikers, this involves training from qualified social workers and discipline from their leader around how they behave during that first meeting.</p>
<blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t want to see any tears coming out of your eyes, and the child doesn&#8217;t either. Remember why we&#8217;re here: to empower the child. If you can&#8217;t handle it, keep your shades on.</p></blockquote>
<p>After that, two bikers are assigned as the child&#8217;s &#8220;Primaries&#8221;. (Always two, and no biker is ever alone with a child &#8211; two is the minimum number at any meeting and parents/guardian must give permission each time as well). They will be on call, a mobile number the child can ring whenever they need to. And that&#8217;s important, because being present and being seen (especially by the child) is what they&#8217;re there for.</p>
<blockquote><p>If the man who hurt this little girl calls or drives by, or even if she is just scared, another nightmare, the bikers will ride over and stand guard all night. &#8230; if she has to testify against her abuser in court, they will go, too, walking with her to the witness stand and taking over the first row of seats. (They) will tell her, &#8220;Look at us, not him.&#8221; And when she&#8217;s done, they will circle her again and walk her out.</p></blockquote>
<p>The emphasis is always on keeping the child safe from fear, of being a wall of friends between them and the influences making them feel vulnerable. And it works, again and again.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve written for BadRep before about how society&#8217;s definition of &#8216;manliness&#8217; <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/12/16/big-dog/" target="_blank">STILL involves violence and requires complete isolation from anything feminine</a>, and how this obviously doesn&#8217;t help feminism (or indeed men). But there are also many other aspects of alpha-maleness which directly harm men, women and equality. Male aggression is (rightly) regarded as often negative in modern life, and we haven&#8217;t come up with new ways of valuing masculinity since the office worker replaced the hunter and warrior.</p>
<p>The challenge facing these bikers is exactly the same as for anyone trying to be a White Knight in the modern age: it&#8217;s a very, very narrow and fragile path to stay on. These men and women are valued because of their capability for violence, at least by reputation. Their quiet physical intimidation is precisely what makes them useful to society, and that&#8217;s actually a rare role these days.</p>
<p>But a successful warrior is defined only by being the best at combat. If any warrior loses the approval of the community due to being untrustworthy, indiscriminate in who they attack or just out of control, then they become a rabid dog who needs to be contained for the safety of others. A superhero only has the public cheering them on in fights if they don&#8217;t take cheap shots, attack a child, injure the defenceless, or any number of things which can break their honourable image.</p>
<p>In the same way, these bikers cannot be seen to be harmful to the children, aggressive to the public or openly criminal &#8211; not one of them, not even once. This charity (which I approve of and respect so much I was nearly moved to tears) works only until the first biker breaks that trust. What this means in the real world is that there are incredibly tight restrictions on how these particular alpha males can channel their masculine image, forcing them to be extremely honourable at all times. It sets up a rare situation where private individuals on the street following their own decisions (not soldiers following orders in an army) are able to display all the violent alpha male traits which usually <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/12/15/alpha-malaise/">result in problems</a> for society, and use them to create trust, healing and safety from fear.</p>
<p>I thought this post was a good fit for BadRep not because I&#8217;m under any impression that biker gangs are bastions of feminism and equality &#8211; I know nothing about it, but expect that any chapters led by women are in the vast minority and regarded differently. But while all the women in the article were treated as equals in a family, this time it was the role of the men I particularly wanted to mention.</p>
<p>The article describes such an atmosphere of caring, security and trust between these bikers and the children that it&#8217;s made many readers into instant converts. I can totally believe that this approach would work on even the most terrified brain &#8211; anything coming for the victim will now have to go through their big friends first. It&#8217;s a real-world solution which lets children sleep at night, and I love that both women and men are out there doing it with such selfless dedication on their own time and at their own expense. (In the article, two bikers stay on watch outside a girl&#8217;s house from 8pm until 2am, when two more arrive to take the next shift. In another example this rolling watch is kept up continuously for two and a half days, by people travelling two hours to get there.) </p>
<p>An online friend of mine and her husband are members of <a href="http://www.patriotguard.org/" target="_blank">The Patriot Guard</a>, bikers in the US who (strictly at the invitation of the family) will attend funerals of servicemen to protect the event from protesters such as the Westboro Baptist Church. (The WBC picket funerals of LGBT personnel, shouting that God killed them because of their sexuality.) It&#8217;s precisely the same thing: bikers using their image to &#8211; when invited &#8211; protect the emotionally vulnerable. It&#8217;s a hugely positive way to use alpha male traits in the modern world.</p>
<blockquote><p>The judge asked the boy, &#8220;Are you afraid?&#8221; No, the boy said. The judge seemed surprised, and asked, &#8220;Why not?&#8221; The boy glanced at [the bikers] sitting in the front row and told the judge, &#8220;Because my friends are scarier than he is.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

					<description><![CDATA[When people talk about art changing lives, I think Raven Kaliana’s work is the kind of thing they mean.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When people talk about art changing lives, I think <a href="http://ravenkaliana.com/"><strong>Raven Kaliana</strong></a>’s work is the kind of thing they mean. Using a mixture of live actors and puppetry, her company <a href="http://puppetrevolution.co.uk/index.html"><strong>Puppet (R)Evolution</strong></a> uses ingenious staging to show what cannot be shown in live action.</p>
<p>The first play of Kaliana’s I saw was <a href="http://hoorayforhollywood.co.uk/"><strong>Hooray for Hollywood</strong></a> a while back. It told the story of her own horrific childhood in the child sex industry. The play showed adult actors from the waist down (just jean legs, skirts and overheard dialogue) and focused on the level – both emotionally and physically – of the children, who were portrayed with puppets.</p>
<p>I first saw <strong>Hooray for Hollywood</strong> in July 2010 and wrote about it then <a href="http://www.fat-quarter.co.uk/archives/1454">for feminist mag <strong>Fat Quarter</strong></a>. More recently an abridged version of the play has been filmed for wider distribution and showed at an event on ending child pornography held at Amnesty International Headquarters. The work is powerful, brave, and through ingenious staging conveys what it would be near-impossible to bring out for open discussion any other way. Frequently <strong>Hooray for Hollywood</strong> is played with a talk afterwards, hosted by various child protection charities.</p>
<p>Puppet (R)Evolution’s current play, <strong>Fragile/Sacred</strong>, was on as part of the <a href="http://www.suspensefestival.com/content/home"><strong>Suspense</strong> puppetry festival</a>.</p>
<p><iframe width="480" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/wSTlozej9NI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Whereas <strong>Hooray for Hollywood</strong> was already an extremely creatively-presented play, <strong>Fragile/Sacred</strong> pushes the boundary further and forms more of an art piece. Once again part of Kaliana’s autobiography, and drawing this time from her teens, the entire performance is wordless, and uses four live actors along with a minimal number of puppets.</p>

The figure holds a model house with orange light in one window and is tilting the house at an angle. Image by Emma Leishman, shared under Fair Use guidelines." title="fragilesacred-0" width="285" height="185" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-8488" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>The set is a large, square tunnel – with each side draped in a different material, used to great effect to convey everything from undergrowth to water to a hospital ward. The opening sequence of the abusive father figure holding a light-up model of a home and pushing his hand into it and licking his hand &#8211; clearly getting a sexual kick out of it – set up the creepiness of the story&#8217;s homelife, and was one of the most uncomfortable few minutes of stagetime I have ever seen.</p>
<p>I feel I very much benefited from seeing <strong>Hooray for Hollywood</strong> first, and feel the two plays could, perhaps, complement each other on a double-bill. As it was, I’m not sure if those coming to <strong>Fragile/Sacred</strong> afresh would have understood all of it.</p>
<p>However, that said, the play is as much about atmosphere as it is about plot. The father figure character (opening scene aside) is oddly inexpressive – tightly-wound and capable of violence, but the actor playing him nonetheless gives little away facially.  I say ‘the actor’ as the part is also sometimes played by a puppet for the longer-range scenes.</p>

It has a father puppet, a rabbit and a raven, as well as some shadow-puppets, but the play also makes good use of models and toys to convey the larger scenes. Puppetry in this play is just one element in a large range of innovative techniques used to convey the story.</p>
<p>Watching adult actors move toy cars or toy helicopters around added a layer of non-optional make-believe to the production. I occasionally found the lines between characters playing and representation of wider plot a little difficult to discern, but that in a way added to the dreamlike quality of the piece.  </p>
<p>I found the complete lack of dialogue a little difficult, but – as in the earlier play – this is about a protagonist who sees a lot, but is often scared to speak or act. The character seemed on the surface to be very passive, yet was making brave and bold moves throughout the play.  The dreamlike quality of the production conveyed a kind of inner sanctuary that the protagonist retreated to and drew strength from.</p>
<p>A fascinating, artful and thoughtful production – and an absolute must for lovers of physical theatre, as well as anyone working in fields which touch on the themes of abuse. But, strange as it feels to say, I found <strong>Fragile/Sacred</strong> &#8211; the gentler of the two plays I&#8217;ve seen &#8211;  was slightly more difficult for me than <strong>Hooray for Hollywood</strong> with its more straightforward plot. While <strong>Hooray for Hollywood</strong> was entirely viewed from the protagonist’s (physical) point of view, <strong>Fragile/Sacred</strong> seems to be viewed from mostly inside the protagonist’s mind, where there is an often luscious stillness while horrors swirl around her and worlds blend together.  That said, the two pieces do inform each other hugely, and I repeat my call for a double-bill.</p>
