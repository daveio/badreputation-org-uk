					<description><![CDATA[If I arrive tomorrow at work with a ‘male’ business suit on, will I be taken more seriously? Am I feminine enough for the office if I don’t wear flawless makeup – or any makeup? ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dress codes (the set of ‘rules’ that govern what we wear in specific situations) are present in every facet of our daily lives, whether explicitly stated or inherently assumed. For this article, there’s only one dress code I want to talk about: what you wear at work.</p>

<p>The working ‘uniform’ is ubiquitous to a huge number of professions, despite the possibility that many of us associate it first and foremost with the service industries. By service industries, I don’t mean simply <a href="http://www.yumsugar.com/New-McDonalds-Uniforms-Love-Hate-1578851">McDonald’s workers</a>, Tesco employees or the like; service means serving you (the consumer) through labour. Retail fashion workers are a prime example, where the ‘uniform’ may not be a classic sweatshirt-and-trousers combo, but rather items picked solely from the collection of garments that the shop provides – living mannequins, in a sense. But this is getting way ahead of myself; let’s go back a bit.</p>
<p>Wearing a uniform, as so many <a href="http://debatemate.wordpress.com/2010/11/19/this-house-would-ban-school-uniforms/">sixth form debates have pointed out</a>, has both positive and negative effects on the individual and the group in any given institution. School uniform has the apparent benefit of making everyone equal (at least, visually) while at the same time ensuring creative idiosyncratic fashion choices are made in the smallest details; how many buttons are done up, how the tie is tied, what badges you wear and the jewellery you sneak in. Even in a photo that has been <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/green-living-blog/2010/aug/23/school-uniforms-cheap-ethical-concerns">posed for this<strong> Guardian</strong> piece</a>, the same uniform turns up in many different styles. So what about the uniform at work? I’ve worked in enough poorly-paid retail jobs to realise what the proposed function of a uniform is, and what actually happens when you wear it.</p>
<p>Just like at school, a uniform is meant to show that all the wearers are equal – visually. For the consumer, workers are identified by what they are wearing; many a time I have been asked in various shops where the changing rooms are, because my particular garb is close enough to the ‘uniform’ of a retail fashion worker to confuse the consumer (although mostly this happens in charity shops. I’m down with that). Workers are set apart from consumers and grouped together as labour through their uniform.</p>
<p>However, looking the same and being the same are (duh) different. My manager and I wear the same uniform: shirt, trousers, and name badge – but are we the same? No. She’s the <em>manager</em>; she’s my boss. Confusing messages of similarity (and potential solidarity?) and hidden hierarchies abound with the working uniform, especially in retail sectors where more than one hierarchy is on the ‘working floor’. You might be able to argue that those industries in which workers are physically grouped by hierarchy – like the factory floor, where the manager is not as physically ‘present’ as on the shop floor – are able to recognise the uniform’s messages of similarity and solidarity more effectively than those where workers of disparate hierarchies are bundled in together.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://bobbypinblog.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/vintage-beautician-uniforms-and-smocks.html">Bobby Pin</a>, these are 1950s beauty salon uniforms:</p>

For this author, they’re utterly beautiful. But then I am a total sucker for ‘the giant coachman collar’.</p></div>
<p>As well as hierarchy being hidden (but strangely elaborated too, I suppose, by its hiddenness), gender too, is at least under an attempted disguise through the wearing of uniforms. Gone are the days of <strong>Mad Men</strong>, where women wore skirts and men wore trousers – now we <em>all</em> have to wear trousers, and horrible polo shirts too. An apparently gender-neutral uniform is provided in a number of sectors (mine was previously white shirt and black trousers – or skirt) that never really successfully disguises gender to the consumer in the same way that it conceals hierarchy to some extent. One-size-fits-all doesn’t work, especially if the size is designed for someone who doesn’t have breasts.</p>

Or, at least, they don’t tell you that you have a uniform. Explicitly, the dress code might be not much more than ‘no shorts or clogs’, but implicitly, the dress code will be bending and morphing round the individuals who are adhering to and working against it. This dress code will tie in gender and authority hierarchies, as illustrated by the business suit and its female equivalent.</p>
<p>From my employment experience (and others who have agreed with me), men wear business suits, but women do not wear business suits, despite this (again) apparently gender-neutral ‘uniform’ being available. A number of women working in offices might wear the <a href="http://www.next.co.uk/women/tailored-looks">female equivalent of the business suit</a> (Next surely embodies this look), which more often than not includes a) skirt b) something frilly c) front-cover-flawless makeup. So it’s the business suit, plus a) traditional emblem of femininity b) annoying and impractical emblem of femininity c) emblem of femininity that is often perceived to be caused by heavy external pressures to look good at all times. The visual ‘uniform’ of the business suit is not gender-neutral, because it is adapted to become gender-specific; whether this is due to individual taste or workplace culture, I’m unsure, but it does inform the hierarchy of the office.</p>

Love. Her.</p></div>The dress code in some offices (especially creative industries) is not always specified explicitly; you might not have to wear a suit, you could wear jeans whenever you please, and if you want to turn up <a href="http://www.rad80sfashion.com/cyndi-lauper.htm">dressed like Cyndi Lauper</a>, by gum you can do. However, the adage of ‘dress for the job you want, not the job you have’ rings in my ears; you can do all those things, but will doing so damage employment opportunities because you haven’t adhered to the implicit dress code? Inter-departmental hierarchies are neatly displayed in adherence to or ignorance of the implicit dress code; if all the workers who were lower paid began to wear the business suits of those who are highest paid, would you be able to see a more democratic office?</p>
<p>Rather than looking at personal comments regarding taste that may be made about office workwear, my interest instead lies in how this implicit dress code dramatically affects the hierarchical makeup of a working environment, potentially without many of the individuals involved even being fully aware of how it is being shaped around them. If I arrive tomorrow at work with a ‘male’ business suit on, will I be taken more seriously? Or, as a woman, if I arrive in a simulated version of that ‘male’ business suit, will I be declined respect because I appear too much like one of the boys? Am I feminine enough for the office if I don’t wear flawless makeup – or any makeup? If I start dressing like the big boys, will they still know it’s me on the inside? I believe there is a definite question of sexuality and sexual preference here that comes into play with ‘levels’ of femininity in the workplace, although I don’t feel able to tackle this in great detail here (or just yet).</p>
<p>Workplace hierarchies are constituted through a vast number of factors, but the role of dress and dress codes is one that can’t be ignored. From traditional environments where gender and authority hierarchies may have been distinguished and designated by an explicit uniform placed upon the workers, contemporary working environments – especially those in the creative industries – now have to juggle with an implicit dress code that is created and defined by the workers themselves (across all hierarchies) in their clothing choices. Plus, there is the added element of workers’ perception of the importance of that dress code or, conversely, the desire to play with it and break some boundaries, in designating what you can, or can’t, wear to work.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is an international organisation which protects abused children in a unique way.<br />
The alpha-masculinity of the men is honourable and has a positive effect on the community.<br />
The women in it are equals, fully involved in the work of being a physically intimidating deterrent.</p>
<p>Oh yes, and it&#8217;s a biker gang.</p>
<p>The Arizona website <strong>AZCentral.com</strong> recently published <A href="http://www.azcentral.com/news/azliving/articles/2012/07/13/20120713bikers-against-child-abuse-make-abuse-victims-feel-safe.html" target="_blank">this story about <strong>BACA &#8211; Bikers Against Child Abuse</strong></a>. The theory behind the group is simple, and works very well: if an abused child is scared of their attacker returning, if their home no longer feels like a safe haven, or if the outside world and school feel too exposed, their new family will stand guard for as long as they need.</p>
<p><em>(Warning &#8211; you should definitely read the whole article, but if you do there is a high chance you will cry your eyes out and have your faith in humanity restored.

John Paul Lilly realised that the 8-year-old boy in his care was too scared to leave the house, and remembered what had successfully taken away his own fears as a child: having a biker gang look out for him. He developed safeguards and checks to make the idea work in a therapeutic environment, and now there are chapters in the United States, Canada, Australia, Italy, The Netherlands and Belgium. The details of precisely what they do are extraordinary.</p>
<p>First of all, the child meets the whole local gang and becomes part of their family. They get the same t-shirt as the gang. They get a biker name. They are under no doubt that these men and women will be there for them from now on. For the bikers, this involves training from qualified social workers and discipline from their leader around how they behave during that first meeting.</p>
<blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t want to see any tears coming out of your eyes, and the child doesn&#8217;t either. Remember why we&#8217;re here: to empower the child. If you can&#8217;t handle it, keep your shades on.</p></blockquote>
<p>After that, two bikers are assigned as the child&#8217;s &#8220;Primaries&#8221;. (Always two, and no biker is ever alone with a child &#8211; two is the minimum number at any meeting and parents/guardian must give permission each time as well). They will be on call, a mobile number the child can ring whenever they need to. And that&#8217;s important, because being present and being seen (especially by the child) is what they&#8217;re there for.</p>
<blockquote><p>If the man who hurt this little girl calls or drives by, or even if she is just scared, another nightmare, the bikers will ride over and stand guard all night. &#8230; if she has to testify against her abuser in court, they will go, too, walking with her to the witness stand and taking over the first row of seats. (They) will tell her, &#8220;Look at us, not him.&#8221; And when she&#8217;s done, they will circle her again and walk her out.</p></blockquote>
<p>The emphasis is always on keeping the child safe from fear, of being a wall of friends between them and the influences making them feel vulnerable. And it works, again and again.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve written for BadRep before about how society&#8217;s definition of &#8216;manliness&#8217; <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/12/16/big-dog/" target="_blank">STILL involves violence and requires complete isolation from anything feminine</a>, and how this obviously doesn&#8217;t help feminism (or indeed men). But there are also many other aspects of alpha-maleness which directly harm men, women and equality. Male aggression is (rightly) regarded as often negative in modern life, and we haven&#8217;t come up with new ways of valuing masculinity since the office worker replaced the hunter and warrior.</p>
<p>The challenge facing these bikers is exactly the same as for anyone trying to be a White Knight in the modern age: it&#8217;s a very, very narrow and fragile path to stay on. These men and women are valued because of their capability for violence, at least by reputation. Their quiet physical intimidation is precisely what makes them useful to society, and that&#8217;s actually a rare role these days.</p>
<p>But a successful warrior is defined only by being the best at combat. If any warrior loses the approval of the community due to being untrustworthy, indiscriminate in who they attack or just out of control, then they become a rabid dog who needs to be contained for the safety of others. A superhero only has the public cheering them on in fights if they don&#8217;t take cheap shots, attack a child, injure the defenceless, or any number of things which can break their honourable image.</p>
<p>In the same way, these bikers cannot be seen to be harmful to the children, aggressive to the public or openly criminal &#8211; not one of them, not even once. This charity (which I approve of and respect so much I was nearly moved to tears) works only until the first biker breaks that trust. What this means in the real world is that there are incredibly tight restrictions on how these particular alpha males can channel their masculine image, forcing them to be extremely honourable at all times. It sets up a rare situation where private individuals on the street following their own decisions (not soldiers following orders in an army) are able to display all the violent alpha male traits which usually <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/12/15/alpha-malaise/">result in problems</a> for society, and use them to create trust, healing and safety from fear.</p>
<p>I thought this post was a good fit for BadRep not because I&#8217;m under any impression that biker gangs are bastions of feminism and equality &#8211; I know nothing about it, but expect that any chapters led by women are in the vast minority and regarded differently. But while all the women in the article were treated as equals in a family, this time it was the role of the men I particularly wanted to mention.</p>
<p>The article describes such an atmosphere of caring, security and trust between these bikers and the children that it&#8217;s made many readers into instant converts. I can totally believe that this approach would work on even the most terrified brain &#8211; anything coming for the victim will now have to go through their big friends first. It&#8217;s a real-world solution which lets children sleep at night, and I love that both women and men are out there doing it with such selfless dedication on their own time and at their own expense. (In the article, two bikers stay on watch outside a girl&#8217;s house from 8pm until 2am, when two more arrive to take the next shift. In another example this rolling watch is kept up continuously for two and a half days, by people travelling two hours to get there.) </p>
<p>An online friend of mine and her husband are members of <a href="http://www.patriotguard.org/" target="_blank">The Patriot Guard</a>, bikers in the US who (strictly at the invitation of the family) will attend funerals of servicemen to protect the event from protesters such as the Westboro Baptist Church. (The WBC picket funerals of LGBT personnel, shouting that God killed them because of their sexuality.) It&#8217;s precisely the same thing: bikers using their image to &#8211; when invited &#8211; protect the emotionally vulnerable. It&#8217;s a hugely positive way to use alpha male traits in the modern world.</p>
<blockquote><p>The judge asked the boy, &#8220;Are you afraid?&#8221; No, the boy said. The judge seemed surprised, and asked, &#8220;Why not?&#8221; The boy glanced at [the bikers] sitting in the front row and told the judge, &#8220;Because my friends are scarier than he is.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

					<description><![CDATA[I think shame is often strongly gendered; we are intended to feel it when we don't live up to our society's imposed, sexist expectations.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over 4 million people have seen <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCvmsMzlF7o">Brené Brown&#8217;s fantastic TED talk about Vulnerability</a>. She&#8217;s a researcher who looked into what successful people have in common, and found that they were all willing to make themselves vulnerable.</p>
<p>I was excited when she gave a follow-up talk in March, but I didn&#8217;t imagine I&#8217;d be posting about it on BadRep. The reason I am is that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psN1DORYYV0#t=15m0s">at 15.00 minutes</a>, it became ALL about gender. (I strongly recommend you check it out &#8211; both videos are excellent):</p>
<p>[<A href="http://youtu.be/psN1DORYYV0">We&#8217;re having trouble with embedding! Click this handy link instead!</a>]</p>
<p>Shame is often strongly gendered; we are intended to feel it when we don&#8217;t live up to our society&#8217;s imposed, sexist expectations. She cites a study from Boston College which got women to answer the question:</p>
<blockquote><p>What do women need to do to conform to female norms?</p></blockquote>
<p>The answers were: be Nice, Thin, Modest&#8230; and &#8216;Use all available resources for appearance&#8217;.</p>
<p>For men, they were: Always show emotional control, Work should be your priority, Pursue status&#8230; and &#8216;Violence&#8217;.</p>
<p>That they&#8217;re different answers for men and women should be enough to prove the need for some real changes in our society by itself, but that the actual points are also so disgusting just seals it for me. Nice. Thin. Don&#8217;t make a fuss. Physical appearance is everything. Emotionally cut off. Violent. Competitive. Judged hugely by job and status. <em>Not one of these things is good for society.</em> We could lose them all and it would only improve everyone&#8217;s lives. (Well, &#8216;nice&#8217; could be okay, if it were applied to the <em>more</em> powerful groups in society, but in terms of gender you&#8217;ve then still got the &#8216;chivalry&#8217; problem &#8211; that men can forget about power differences <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/01/25/keep-the-gift-pay-what-you-owe/">if they treat women &#8216;nicely&#8217;</a> while giving up nothing.)</p>
<p>Brown&#8217;s previous point had been that successful and happy people have to allow themselves the risk of being seen as weak, or to fail. However, in reaching that conclusion (and it&#8217;s definitely true), she only interviewed women. In this second talk she relates how a male fan pointed out to her that men often feel unable to choose this route.</p>
<blockquote><p>Shame feels the same for men and women, but it is organised by gender&#8230; </p>
<p>For men, shame is not a bunch of competing, conflicting expectations [as it is for women], shame is one: Do Not Be Perceived As Weak. </p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>Brené Brown</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The fan claims that it&#8217;s the women in his family who reinforce this for him. In terms of how strictly the two sets of &#8216;norms-to-conform-to&#8217; listed above are enforced, I often see that men have a lot more leeway in dropping one or two of them&#8230; but only if they replace them with &#8216;money&#8217;.</p>
<p>So the next time I&#8217;m looking for a shorthand example for why feminism is important, I&#8217;ll reference what people perceive as the <em>biggest</em> demands by society on who they are allowed to be. It&#8217;s a flawed, gender-binary test, but the fact that the public returned those answers counts for a lot. That a list so gendered and outrightly harmful to society should be the TOP pressures many of us seem to be facing is something we just don&#8217;t need. It may not be set in law, but <a href="http://nothingbutawordbag.wordpress.com/2012/04/22/gendered-marketing-really-gets-on-my-tits/" />this stuff is a strong daily message</a>.</p>
<p>&#8230;Which makes me want to find a solution. Well, first to scream F*** THAT and opt out, and <em>then</em> find a solution. Equality means removing this heinous bullshit for <em>everyone</em>. The goals listed as the top answers in that survey are both unattainable in size and harmful in practice, but what choice do we have? It&#8217;s fine for me to urge people to stop conforming, but for many if they do the reality is they&#8217;ll never pass a job interview again. (Although <a href="http://vagendamag.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/hair-not-musical.html">not shaving your armpits or legs sometimes works out just fine</a>). </p>
<p>I refuse to give up. Reducing inequality towards any gender is so fundamental to everyone&#8217;s happiness that stuff like this just makes me more determined to keep fighting: we&#8217;ve all got to keep educating each other, pushing for change and making the issues visible. Whether it&#8217;s about who they marry, if they have sex, issues of consent, or who their political leaders are, women have a lot less freedom than men <a href="http://www.womankind.org.uk/policy-and-resources/">internationally</a>. That&#8217;s not in dispute. Gender inequality is measurable. If you really can&#8217;t see it, you haven&#8217;t spent two seconds looking. Yes, I&#8217;m also concerned with the pressures sexism places on men, and I think these &#8216;norm lists&#8217; showcase exactly why there&#8217;s so much still to do for everybody.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Why is it the torture and death of American Psycho's women that seems to abide with the reader? Like all satire, the book exaggerates and burlesques that which already exists.]]></description>

</ul>
<h3>The Plot Sickens</h3>
<p>To focus on misogyny is to obscure <strong>American Psycho</strong>’s scope, to ignore that the book is an uncompromising, unapologetic vortex of misanthropy and nihilism. Its narrator expresses disgust, contempt, anxiety and fear towards women, gay people, art students, Jewish people, the non-WASP, the homeless, the poor – anyone, in fact, who differs even by a small degree (a marginally more impressive business card, a better restaurant table) from the ideal which Bateman forces himself to emulate and sustain. Men in the novel are portrayed as unsympathetically as women, and dispatched as dispassionately – so why is it the torture and death of women that seems to abide with the reader?</p>

<p>Like all satire, the book exaggerates and burlesques that which already exists. The book’s scenes of torture and murder were, apparently, all based on Ellis’ reading of real life cases and criminology textbooks, not whimsically called into being by him. So <strong>American Psycho</strong> on one level is an uncensored, unsanitised exposé of what has already been done to women without any incitement or instruction from its author. Neither does Ellis’ writing give the impression that violence against women is in any way attractive. The impression it does give, to me at least, is that violence against women is horrifying, viscerally disgusting, and the preserve of fucked-up, nightmarish individuals who are increasingly prevalent during a stage of socio-economic development which encourages selfishness and greed over empathy, and whose actions are increasingly ignored or disbelieved within the same environment. His work is a mirror, not a manifesto or an instruction manual. To posit it as something qualitatively worse either than crimes actually committed against women throughout history, or to the presentation of sexualised violence or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_killer#In_media_and_popular_culture">serial killing </a>in almost any other area of the entertainment world, seems dubious.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting too how the deaths of Bateman’s victims are affected by their socio-economic background. Having decided against the murder of his date Patricia – a minor character so boringly materialistic that I’m fully on board with the theory that takes her to be Patrick’s imaginary female persona – Bateman reflects on whether it’s ‘her family’s wealth [that] protects her tonight’. In contrast, the vagrants and call girls he kills are already economic casualties, considered disposable even before they become casualties of violence. No character from society&#8217;s lower strata appears to be missed; it is only Paul Owen, Patrick&#8217;s peer and rival, whose disappearance is considered deserving enough to warrant a police investigation. The crude and blatant contrast between Bateman’s lifestyle and that of his victims – their disparity in wealth, and therefore in power, is explicitly fetishized in more than one encounter – which calls attention to the issue of why the victims of such killers are so often sex workers, or homeless, or transient, both male and female:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Within police culture&#8230; we know that if a prostitute goes missing and is reported as missing, that they won&#8217;t be given the same priority as other people would get&#8230; [sex workers are not] valued enough in our culture for the police to take it seriously.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8211; <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2010/dec/22/world-violence-sex-workers">David Wilson, Howard League for Penal Reform</a></p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; again intertwining a socio-economic indictment with a proto-feminist impulse.</p>
<h3>The Plot Thickens</h3>

<p>One could argue incessantly about whether the book itself is misogynistic, or edifying, or indeed readable, but a<br />
<a href="http://www.socialjusticeleague.net/2011/09/how-to-be-a-fan-of-problematic-things/">more productive debate</a> centres on whether one can like art that one also acknowledges as problematic. When reading Anwyn Crawford’s excellent <a href="http://njmcgee.tumblr.com/post/282550705/anwyn-crawford-makes-an-impressive-attack-on-nick">critique</a> of the treatment of women in the lyrics and prose of that other aging <em>enfant terrible</em>, Nick Cave, I wasn’t convinced by all of her analysis – Cave&#8217;s work at least in its earlier phases seems, like Ellis, preoccupied with morbidly examining a pathologised masculinity rather than valorising it – but the most substantial point I drew from the ensuing debate was that the issue may be less such works themselves and more their involvement in the mainstreaming, acceptance and excusing of problematic attitudes. The gynophobic aspects of these works are made respectable by being cloaked as edgy or transgressive, when they merely dramatise the violence and inequality that already exists. Although I still contend that the violence in Ellis’ writing is not there as intentional titillation, as long as there are those for whom such things are lived experience, rather than escapist fantasy or performance material, then there will be a correspondingly visceral response to their artistic portrayal.</p>
<p>Although readers who read for prurient or puerile pleasure are hardly something for which writers can bargain or legislate, questions can be asked about the <em>cachet</em> Ellis manages to retain in the world of <strong>Guardian</strong> profiles and Soho salons, when other works of equally politicised and equally slapstick splatterpunk – Dennis Cooper, say, or Stewart Home, or even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCUM_Manifesto"><strong>The SCUM Manifesto</strong></a> – languish in the ‘cult fiction’ gutter. Helen Zahavi&#8217;s brilliant <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_Weekend_(novel)"><strong>Dirty Weekend</strong></a>, a novel published the same year as <strong>American Psycho</strong>, explores similar themes but blurs the lines between victim and perpetrator. There are marked stylistic differences, sure – Zahavi uses lyrical prose to distance or distract the reader from the trauma and gore she describes, whereas Ellis more or less rubs the reader’s face in it – and the violence of Zahavi’s protagonist is entirely reactive: she wishes only to be left alone and when she is not, she strikes out and strikes upwards. <strong>Dirty Weekend</strong>, despite receiving polarised reviews on publication, has had nothing like the long-term vilification heaped upon <strong>American Psycho</strong>, but by the same token has received far less enduring acclaim or even attention.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s just Ellis’ pre-existing status as <em>wunderkind</em> author of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Less_Than_Zero_(novel)"><strong>Less Than Zero</strong></a> that elevates his subsequent work. Or it might be the very obviousness of his traditionalist politics &#8211; <strong>American Psycho</strong> has more than a bit in common with something like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_exit_to_brooklyn"><strong>Last Exit to Brooklyn</strong></a>, a cult novel of 1964 which also enlists depictions of depravity and sexual violence in the service of what can look an awful lot like proscriptive neo-puritanism. Is there more mainstream space for works which reproduce existing social structures and power relations, which, even if they challenge their existence, do so through the evidently ambiguous strategies of grotesque exaggeration or <em>reductio ad ridiculum </em>rather than direct disruption? For all its horrified laughter at the state we’re in, <strong>American Psycho</strong> isn’t in the business of imagining alternatives to it.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[American Psycho is a house built with the tools of the master: it is, just like 80s capitalism, crass, lurid, vulgar, heavy-handed and unapologetic.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The last time I wrote that <a href="http://velvetcoalmine.wordpress.com/2011/05/26/on-liking-american-psycho/">yes, I did like <strong>American Psycho</strong></a>, and no, that wasn&#8217;t because I&#8217;d only seen the film, I was pleasantly surprised to hear that other women felt similarly, but I’m aware that we’re still a minority. <strong>American Psycho</strong> proved controversial even before its release in 1991, its unedited manuscript pushed from publisher to publisher, leaked extracts from it incurring public outrage, and its eventual appearance leapt upon by critics with the single-minded speed of a rat up a Habitrail tube. In terms of people judging the book without having read it, not a great deal seems to have changed. I don&#8217;t really expect to alter anyone&#8217;s opinion with this post, and it isn&#8217;t really even a recommendation &#8211; it&#8217;s just an exploration of why I don&#8217;t regard <strong>American Psycho</strong> as the worst book ever written.</p>

<p>I read the book as a deeply moral – disappointingly puritan, if you like – anti-capitalist and even vaguely feminist tract. <strong>American Psycho</strong> is a house built with the tools of the master: it is, just like 1980s capitalism, crass, lurid, vulgar, heavy-handed and unapologetic. It bludgeons home its basic homily, that consumerism fails to make us happy or to lend meaning to our lives, with all the subtle and delicate artistry of a Reagan speech. But beyond this, in 2012 it’s undeniable that the values and trends the book castigated two decades back have only become more deeply entrenched. Does the book’s earnest, and still depressingly relevant, indictment of capitalism and consumerism excuse its scenes of rape, torture and murder? Maybe not, but I think those who criticise the book on these grounds, like those who called for its suppression and boycott twenty years ago, end up alienating a potential if problematic ally.</p>
<h3>Nightmares on Wall Street</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to take seriously much that Ellis says, about either this book in particular or his work in general. A lot of his public pronouncements deal in Dylanesque obfuscation, or deliberate outrage-baiting – his Twitter account alone is a masterclass in trolling – which makes it both absurd and unfortunate that his work is so often perceived as deadly serious and condemned on the same grounds. His explanations of the origins of <strong>American Psycho</strong>, though, have the ring of sincerity, and place the book in opposition to the impact of 1980s society and culture on the individual male:</p>
<blockquote><p>‘the book is, need I even say this, a criticism of a certain kind of masculinity and a certain kind of white male, heterosexual, capitalist, yuppie scumbag behavior.’</p>
<p>– <a href="http://www.punkglobe.com/breteastonellisinterview0411.php">Bret Easton Ellis, 2011 </a></p>
<p>‘Whenever I am asked to talk American Psycho, I have to remember why I was writing it at the time and what it meant to me. A lot of it had to do with my frustration with having to become an adult and what it meant to be an adult male in American society. I didn&#8217;t want to be one, because all it was about was status. Consumerist success was really the embodiment of what it meant to be a cool guy.’<br />
&#8211; <a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/authors/interviews/article/47587-american-psycho-at-20-catching-up-with-bret-easton-ellis.html">Bret Easton Ellis, 2011</a></p>
<p>‘[Bateman] was crazy the same way [I was]. He did not come out of me sitting down and wanting to write a grand sweeping indictment of yuppie culture. It initiated because of my own isolation and alienation at a point in my life. I was living like Patrick Bateman. I was slipping into a consumerist kind of void that was supposed to give me confidence and make me feel good about myself but just made me feel worse and worse and worse about myself.’<br />
&#8211; <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/rage/archive/s3034896.htm">Bret Easton Ellis, 2010</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Fay Weldon, one of very few women to <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/1991/apr/25/fiction.breteastonellis">positively review</a> the novel, did so while emphasising its anti-capitalist aspects. <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Shopping-Space-American-Generation-Fiction/dp/1852422556/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1336917717&amp;sr=1-2">Elizabeth Young</a>, too, identified Patrick Bateman as not a character but a cipher indicating the nihilism and emptiness of yuppie culture and identity.</p>
<p>Bateman is of course capitalism’s dirty little secret &#8211; the madman in the attic. His sociopathy is mirrored in the socio-economic inequality and political insincerity around him. In his world, the atomised and alienated dealings of colleagues, friends and lovers are highlighted through contrast with the visceral intimacy of murder, and Ellis’ stylistic trick of detailing frenzied sex and violence in flat and clinically dispassionate prose does not disguise that as a form of human encounter it carries more weight than Bateman’s ritualised interactions with colleagues or his sexless and loveless interactions with girlfriends. His narration frequently betrays a yearning for consummation, contact and engagement in the midst of the desperate aching loneliness, the longing for meaning (even Bateman’s violence is purposeless and arbitrary) which permeates the book. In a society so unsustainably alienating and unequal that the centre plainly cannot hold, we see how badly things can fall apart.</p>
<h3>Psycho Drama</h3>
<p>Accused of having written ‘a how-to novel on the torture and dismemberment of women’, Ellis <a href="http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,313573,00.html">found himself</a> subject to boycotts, hate mail, death threats and violent revenge fantasies, on the basis that he had clearly written this book as either wish-fulfillment or glamorised incitement. Detractors of the book and author on these grounds display a puzzling inability to distinguish between creator and creation, which as a first principle is utterly bizarre – where is it written that characters must necessarily be extensions of an approving creator?</p>
<p>The novel contains a few dozen pages in amongst four hundred or so on the torture and dismemberment of women – and of men – though their impact is disproportionate. These scenes – often ludicrous, often grotesque to the point of comedy – are presented as a logical extension of the lack of empathy and mindless, numb urge to consume that characterise the world in which they take place. They don’t seem written in order to arouse any more than the determinedly un-erotic, sterile sex scenes do, or the interminable deconstructions of clothes, cosmetics and Huey Lewis’ back catalogue. The book gradually reaches a point where reading about all three feels indistinguishable in its horrific, unrelenting tedium.</p>

I got through these scenes gingerly on my first read, treating it as a kind of endurance test, but tend to skip them on subsequent reads as they aren&#8217;t the reasons I revisit the book. I read <strong>American Psycho</strong> in the same semi-masochistic spirit in which I watch, for instance, Chris Morris’ and Charlie Brooker’s hipster-eviscerating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Barley"><strong>Nathan Barley</strong></a>, a work also bleakly amusing, also received with disbelief and criticism of its gratuitousness, and also concerned with the consequences of elevating surface over meaning, although its slack-jawed, skinny-jeaned targets were more symptom than cause – and arguably Ellis had already been there, done that, too, with 1998’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glamorama"><strong>Glamorama</strong></a>. I read <strong>American Psycho</strong> like I’d read any work which explored capitalism, consumerism and their messy, distasteful effects, from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_to_the_End_of_the_Night"><strong>Voyage au bout de la nuit</strong></a> to <strong>The Hunger Games</strong>. (But not de Sade. Sometimes life’s just too short.)</p>
<p>Finally, if perhaps most obviously, it takes some effort to read Ellis’ presentation of Bateman’s attitude or actions as approving. Unlike, say, Thomas Harris depicting Hannibal Lecter, or the creators of <strong>Dexter</strong>, he gives his anti-hero little in the way of charisma or appeal. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Harron">Mary Harron</a>’s film of the novel, produced a decade after it when the stardust of the 1980s had settled somewhat, arguably does more than the book to establish Ellis’ unreliable narrator as a slick and stylish seducer rather than a pathetic interchangeable fantasist. Despite the <a href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/foreignc/2012/03/american-psycho.html">subversive</a> nature of Harron’s direction, Christian Bale&#8217;s <em>tour-de-force</em> performance renders Bateman far more compelling than his written incarnation, who is overtly racist, misogynistic and homophobic as well as dim, snobbish, superficial, chronically insecure, socially awkward, a hopeless conversationalist, and tediously obsessed with material goods. If it weren’t for the fact that almost every other character displays exactly the same character traits, it’s conceivable that the novel’s Bateman could make his dates expire of boredom without any need to break out the pneumatic nail-gun.</p>
<p>It’s interesting too that the film’s elevation of Bateman is bound up with its objectification of him, particularly via its concentration on his character’s <a href="http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=515985">proto</a>&#8211;<a href="http://www.marksimpson.com/pages/journalism/metrosexual_beckham.html">metrosexual </a>aspects, but that’s a whole other essay.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A spectre is haunting London. My daily commute, never a joyful affair, has recently been granted a further dimension of irritation by adverts on buses bearing the image of Meryl Streep dolled up as Mrs Thatcher.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A spectre is haunting London. My daily commute, never a joyful affair, has recently been lent a further dimension of irritation by adverts on buses, hoving into view with tedious regularity, bearing the image of <strong>Meryl Streep</strong> dolled up as Mrs Thatcher in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1007029/"><strong>The Iron Lady</strong></a>. Thirty years on from Thatcher&#8217;s rise to power, and after a minor rash of small-screen depictions – Andrea Riseborough in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1067578/"><strong>The Long Walk to Finchley</strong></a>, Lindsay Duncan in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1230150/"><strong>Margaret</strong></a> &#8211; Streep will now portray her on the big screen, the prospect of which I could have happily lived without.</p>
<p>Having as I do <a href="http://velvetcoalmine.wordpress.com/2011/09/19/the-pits-and-the-pendulum/">firsthand experience</a> of the impact of Thatcher’s thirteen years, her government’s break with prevailing consensus and bloody-minded devotion to neoliberal orthodoxies, an objective and rational evaluation of the woman is probably beyond me. That said, her presumably impending death &#8211; although I do have a longstanding appointment at a pub in King&#8217;s Cross to dutifully raise a glass &#8211; is something to which I&#8217;ll be largely indifferent. It won&#8217;t matter. Thatcher as a person has far less bearing on the current world than what she represents. The damage has been done, the battle lost, and much as I might appreciate a Truth and Reconciliation Commission into the 1980s, Thatcher and her co-conspirators are by now <a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/steven-baxter/2011/12/decisions-away-information">too old and whiskey-soaked</a> to be held to any meaningful account.</p>
<p>Efforts to humanise Thatcher, even when they enlist Meryl Streep, seem discomfiting and deeply bizarre. What she means has transcended what she was, is and will be. The purpose of this post, therefore, apart from being an exercise in detachment for me, is to look briefly at some aspects of Thatcher’s image in political and pop culture, and to consider the effect of her gender on her role as a woman in power. Quick, before the next bus goes past.</p>
<h3>The Icon Lady</h3>
<blockquote><p>Meanings of all kinds flow through the figures of women, and they often do not include who she herself is.</p>
<p>&#8211; Marina Warner, <strong>Monuments and Maidens</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Thatcher’s visual staying power in political and pop culture is as great as her impact on <a href="http://johnrobb77.wordpress.com/2009/06/16/how-margaret-thatcher-changed-pop-culture-for-ever/">oppositional music</a>. The face of Thatcher most often called to mind is that of what Angela Carter termed her ‘balefully iconic’ post-1983 premiership: encased in true-blue power suits, wielding a handbag, her hair lacquered into immobile submission, her earlier style solidified into a heavily stylized femininity bordering on drag. Paul Flynn, in a <a href="http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/paul_flynn/2006/05/by_paul_flynn.html">fairly tortured discussion</a> of Thatcher’s status as a gay icon, put it down to her ‘ability to carry a strong, identifiable, signature look&#8230; an intrinsic and steely power to self-transform’, and a ‘camp, easily cartooned presence’. The startling evocative power of this look, its ability to summon up its host of contemporary social, cultural and political associations, is why I jump when Streep&#8217;s replication of it intrudes into my vision. It’s like being repeatedly sideswiped by the 1980s, which is something the last UK election had already made me thoroughly sick of.</p>

The artist Alison Jackson <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/feb/11/margaret-thatcher-meryl-streep-photograph">observes</a> that all three &#8216;had what it takes to become a modern icon: big hair, high foreheads and a face that would allow you to project your own fears and desires on to it.&#8217; Conversely, subsequent political leaders &#8211; including both <a href="http://cvcl.mit.edu/hybrid_gallery/tatcher_blair.html">Blair</a> and <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_OVzuV6XUReA/TJ0EjTQ29WI/AAAAAAAAARU/SOy8bXxatls/s1600/Cameron-Thatcher.png">Cameron</a> &#8211; have had their own faces conflated with Thatcher’s, usually as part of left-wing critiques meant to signify the closeness of their policies to hers. Thatcher’s image is here used as an instantly recognisable political signifier, communicating a set of ideological ideas in a single package, as well as a self-contained political warning sign.</p>
<p>Although the kind of passive objectification associated with Monroe might seem at odds with the idea of Thatcher as a great historical actor with narrative agency in her own right, the images of both women are used in a cultural tradition in which the female figure in particular becomes a canvas for the expression of abstract ideas (think justice, liberty, victory). The abstract embodiment of multiple meanings, and the strategic performance of traditional ideas of femininity, constitute sources of power which Thatcher and her political and media allies exploited to the hilt in their harnessing of support for the policies she promoted.</p>
<h3>Iron Maidens</h3>
<p>Thatcher’s image, rather than appealing solely to a particular aspect of femininity, was a tense mixture of conflicting and mutually reinforcing signifiers. Angela Carter <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/46831407/Angela-Carter-Shaking-a-Leg">identified</a> it as a composite of feminine archetypes, including <strong>Dynasty</strong>’s Alexis Carrington, Elizabeth I as Gloriana, Countess Dracula, and one of PG Wodehouse’s aunts – tropes sharing a certain type of burlesqued and grotesque dragon-femininity. The 1981 Falklands conflict allowed the discourse around Thatcher to reference the precedents of both Queen Victoria and Churchill, and she was photographed on a tank in an <a href="http://iconicphotos.wordpress.com/2009/04/23/thatcher-in-a-tank/">image</a> that the <strong>Daily Telegraph</strong> described as ‘a cross between Isadora Duncan and Lawrence of Arabia’.</p>
<p>Justine Picardie, in a <a href="http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/article/TMG8940986/The-Making-of-The-Iron-Ladys-Wardrobe.html">grimly fascinating read</a>, roots Thatcher’s style in the rigid grooming of well-turned-out 1950s femininity in general and her sartorially plain Methodist upbringing in particular:</p>
<blockquote><p>Interviewed by Dr Miriam Stoppard for Yorkshire Television in 1985, she gave a glimpse of a childhood desire for the luxury of colour, and shop-bought extravagance, whether a new dress or sofa cover: &#8216;that was a great expenditure and a great event. So you went out to choose them, and you chose something that looked really rather lovely, something light with flowers on it. My mother: &#8220;That&#8217;s not serviceable.&#8221; And how I longed for the time when I could buy things that were not serviceable.&#8217;</p></blockquote>
<p>Even at the height of her political power, she chose to retain the ‘pretty’ and ‘softening’ effects of her trademark <a href="http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/galleries/TMG8946898/Margaret-Thatchers-style-over-the-years.html">horrible bows</a>. Alongside this tendency towards aspirational frivolity, she cultivated connotations of the provincial housewife – a ‘Housewife Superstar’ – wearing an apron while on the campaign trail and being shown washing dishes while contesting the party leadership. </p>
<p>Her ‘Iron Lady’ speech distinctly echoed the ‘body of a weak and feeble woman&#8230; heart and stomach of a king’ construction <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_to_the_Troops_at_Tilbury">associated with Elizabeth I</a> in its drawing on the tension between conflicting signifiers:</p>
<blockquote><p>I stand before you tonight in my Red Star chiffon evening gown, my face softly made up and my fair hair gently waved, the Iron Lady of the Western World. A cold war warrior, an Amazon philistine, even a Peking plotter. Well, am I any of those things? Yes&#8230; Yes, I am an iron lady, after all it wasn&#8217;t a bad thing to be an iron duke.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Not a Man to Match Her?</h3>
<p>Thatcher&#8217;s courting of various feminine roles did not prevent the assigning of masculine attributes to her – notably in oppositional parodies and satire. Her iconic <strong>Spitting Image</strong> puppet was shown wearing a suit and tie and smoking a cigar, addressed as &#8216;Sir&#8217;, and given a more or less explicit emasculating effect upon male colleagues and political opponents:</p>
<p><iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/OyU8qmzGsEg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Outside satire, the 1984 Miners&#8217; Strike has been conceptualised both as a <a href="http://deathatthemall.wordpress.com/2011/12/16/men-at-war-mark-simpson-examines-masculinity-and-the-miners-strike/">mass emasculation</a> of ordinary male miners <em>and</em> an overt bout of cock-duelling between Thatcher and miners&#8217; leader Arthur Scargill, each of whom were criticised for an absolutist and stubbornly Napoleonic approach to the conflict rather than a more ‘feminine’ openness to negotiation and compromise.</p>
<p>As Dawn Fowler <a href="http://eprints.uwe.ac.uk/7817/">notes</a> in her consideration of dramatic treatments of the Falklands War, a problem with such portrayals of Thatcher is that she &#8216;can be represented as simply denying her true feminine self in favour of a crazed fascist agenda.&#8217; <strong>The Comic Strip</strong>’s <a href="http://gaffa.org/dreaming/glc.html">satirical take</a> on Thatcher’s battles with Ken Livingstone and the Greater London Council presented her as the victim of alien or demonic possession, the ending of which left her soft and passive – restored to her presumably appropriate, natural form. Both applauding Thatcher for her ability to overcome &#8216;traditional&#8217; feminine weakness and irrationality and behave symbolically as a man, and castigating her for her failure or suppression of a &#8216;true&#8217; soft and accommodating female nature, are equally dubious in the qualities they seek to assign to &#8216;real&#8217; women.</p>
<blockquote><p>Thatcher was repeatedly likened to a female impersonator, a man in blue dresses. The reason for this is simple, and apparently shatterproof: we have so firmly linked power and masculinity that we think a powerful woman is a category error. Instead of changing our ideas about power, we change the sex of a powerful woman. </p>
<p>&#8211; <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2011/dec/09/marilyn-monroe-margaret-thatcher-biopics"><strong>Sarah Churchwell</strong></a></p></blockquote>
<h3>No Job for a Lady?</h3>
<p>While Thatcher’s election to Prime Minister was of course a landmark for women in politics, her much-vaunted &#8216;grocer&#8217;s daughter&#8217; outsider status was mediated through an Oxford education and marriage into wealth. The number of prominent women serving as MPs and Cabinet ministers prior to or alongside Thatcher &#8211; Nancy Astor, Margaret Bondfield, Betty Harvie Anderson, Jenny Lee, Barbara Castle to name a few – make her ascension exceptional but not unique. Nor should Thatcher’s progress in the male-dominated world of British politics obscure how little she actually did for women once in office: the lack of women appointed to ministerial positions; her disparaging of ‘strident Women’s Libbers’; her invariably male ideological protégés. Historian Helen Castor, <a href="http://thebrowser.com/interviews/helen-castor-on-queens-and-power?page=3">discussing</a> the ‘extraordinary’ parallels between the iconography of Thatcher and that of Elizabeth I, points out that both women emphasised themselves as the exception to a rule:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;what those two women both did was not say, Women can rule, women can hold power. They both said, Yes, OK, most women are pretty feeble, but I am a special woman.</p></blockquote>
<p>At a point where Thatcher’s chosen ideology is resulting in <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/the-womens-blog-with-jane-martinson/2011/oct/05/womens-dwindling-support-for-cameron">falling standards of living</a> for women &#8211; and men &#8211; across Britain; where the dim and insubstantial <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3252FSW7OC4">Louise Mensch</a> can manage to position herself as a rising star, and where the Home Secretary’s political decisions make fewer headlines than her choice of shoe, I’m relieved to see that attempts to rehabilitate Thatcher as any kind of feminist icon are largely <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-derbyshire-16438897">being </a><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/the-womens-blog-with-jane-martinson/2012/jan/05/margaret-thatcher-feminist-icon?INTCMP=SRCH">resisted</a>. It remains to be seen whether <strong>The Iron Lady</strong>, and its fallout in the form of frankly offensive Thatcher-inspired <a href="http://www.graziadaily.co.uk/fashion/archive/2011/08/11/holy-handbags-batgirl-its-georgia-may-thatcher.htm">fashion shoots</a>, means that her image is now undergoing a further transcendence into the realms of irony and kitsch (as has happened with both Marilyn and Che), or whether this is part of a conscious revival of the political associations her image originally carried and to which we are being returned – conditions profoundly unfriendly to female independence and agency despite the women occasionally employed as their shock troops.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Team BadRep were sent a writing prompt last month: <em>What is your favourite film or TV series, and why? If it’s what you’d call ‘feminist-friendly’, what about it appealed? If it isn’t, how does that work for you, and are there nonetheless scenes, characters and so on that have stayed with you and continue to occupy a soft spot for you as a feminist pop culture adventurer?</em></strong></p>
<p>Alright then, <strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0390022/">Friday Night Lights</a></strong> (the film, not the TV series). It&#8217;s the true-ish (true in as much as any Hollywood adaptation of real events is ever true) story of the 1988 Permian Panthers, a highschool American football team based out of Odessa, Texas. Based on the book of the same name by <strong>H.G. Bassinger</strong>, it&#8217;s really quite an amazing depiction of the levels of pressure placed on young players in a town that has nothing else going for it. Odessa is the sort of town where you get into college with a football scholarship, or you stay there and live out the same life your parents did.</p>
<p>It might be a somewhat unusual choice for this site, given that it&#8217;s focused entirely on the macho-tastic world of American football, and features less than a handful of female characters &#8211; all defined by their relationship to one of the males (the coach&#8217;s wife, the quarterback&#8217;s mother) &#8211; who get maybe 10 lines in total. But stick with me here, because the film does raise a few issues worth discussing.</p>
<p>First up, let&#8217;s just cover why this film counts as a favourite. American football, more than perhaps any other sport, is self-mythologising. It builds up a grand narrative, spins out legends, and casts itself as something more than just a bunch of millionaires in armour running into each other. Go watch a highlight <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVuA79cyM8Y">video</a>, or an episode of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc2QGdrecTo">America&#8217;s Game</a>, which shows the story of each year&#8217;s Superbowl winner. Everything about them, the way the footage is cut, the music, is all part of narrativising the events, making myths. And Friday Night Lights captures that perfectly.</p>
<p>Part of the reason the film captures that feeling so well, and part of what makes it a good film (other than some excellent cinematography and casting) is the soundtrack. The film is almost entirely accompanied by the work of Explosions in the Sky, a sweeping instrumental act native to Texas, where the events take place. Take a listen to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1Tv5mty6U">this</a> and tell me it doesn&#8217;t make you want to go do something grand.</p>
<p>But enough of the fanboying. Let&#8217;s look at the issues this film brings up.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/friday-night-lights-poster.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="5891" data-permalink="/2011/07/21/write-what-you-love-friday-night-lights/friday-night-lights-poster/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/friday-night-lights-poster.jpg?fit=410%2C607&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="410,607" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="friday-night-lights-poster" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/friday-night-lights-poster.jpg?fit=202%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/friday-night-lights-poster.jpg?fit=410%2C607&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5891" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/friday-night-lights-poster-202x300.jpg?resize=202%2C300" alt="Poster for the 2004 film Friday Night Lights.

<p>The first interesting thing the film handles is issues of race. Texas, particularly the smaller towns, is not well known for its progressive attitude towards racial equality. So when the championship game turns out to be against the state&#8217;s first all-black team, Dallas Carter, this is a big thing. And you know what? It&#8217;s handled pretty damn well. It can probably best be summed up with one particular quote. The coaches and assorted hangers-on of both teams have met to discuss where the game will take place, and how it will be adjudicated to ensure fairness. Asked about referees, the Panthers&#8217; coach suggests hiring a team of officials. Asked whether these zebras<sup><a href="/2011/07/21/write-what-you-love-friday-night-lights/#footnote_0_5890" id="identifier_0_5890" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Zebras being a nickname for referees, due to their black and white striped tops. ">1</a></sup> will be black or white the coach replies &#8220;I believe a zebra&#8217;s got about the same amount of black stripes as he does white ones.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just the coaches. The players on the Panthers are a pretty varied mix of black, white and Latino. It&#8217;s hard to say how much of this is credit to the film makers, and how much is merely a reflection on the make up of the real life team the events are based on. What is definitely to their credit though is the way these characters are handled. The film makers resist the temptation to give us Male White Lead #27b and make the entire film about the quarterback. Instead we get equal screen time devoted to several of the characters (with the arguable show-stealer being <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1035682/"><strong>Derek Luke</strong></a> as star running back James &#8220;Boobie&#8221; Miles). It&#8217;s nice to see.</p>
<p>The second issue we get in the film, which I&#8217;d argue is relevant to basically everyone, is the pressure placed on young people and the struggles of forming an identity. In the context of the film this identity is mostly about defining yourself as a person beyond what your town expects of you as a player. But the basic principle applies to any youthful deviation from accepted norms, which is probably something a fair few readers here have experienced. Telling the world you identify as a feminist might not immediately seem the same as telling your dad you don&#8217;t care that much about football, but I think the film does a nice job of showing the universal pressures of youth that tie both experiences together.</p>
<p>Being the champions is basically all the town cares about. On game day, everything shuts down as people leave their workplaces to go watch the game. It&#8217;s made clear to the coach that if they don&#8217;t win the state championship he should probably think about finding a different down to live in. Win and you&#8217;re a local god, lose and you&#8217;re a pariah. The alcoholic former-champion father of one character captures this particularly well, kind and caring when the team&#8217;s winning, drunk and abusive when his son makes a mistake. How does someone grow and learn to be themselves faced with that?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a good film, it raises some interesting points, and it gives a fascinating look into the life of small town Texas. And for all that it shows the darker side of football, it&#8217;s still the film that made me go out and start playing, so it has to get some credit for that.</p>

<p><strong>Calamity Jane</strong> (played by <a title="Wikipedia - Doris Day" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doris_Day" target="_blank">Doris Day</a>) starts off the 1953 <a title="IMDB Calamity Jane" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0045591/" target="_blank">musical film</a> of the same name as a tomboy, gets humiliated and learns to be a girl, then gets married. In a dress and everything.</p>
<p>Despite this, it’s one of my very favourite films.</p>
<p>Proud and tomboyish ‘Calam’ is a popular and respected figure in the town of Deadwood. Not just one of the boys, but determined to outshoot, outdrink, outswagger them all. But she&#8217;s met her match in Wild Bill Hickok whom she admires and who grudgingly admires her, although they get into one of those “ooh I hate you and don’t fancy you at all, nope” oneupmanship <a title="YouTube - I Can Do WIthout You" href="http://youtu.be/xlqdEca3hks" target="_blank">songs</a>. Calam and Bill are comrades, but Calam’s in love with the local Lieutenant Danny, and saves his life, but he’s not interested in her. Because he’s a dick, basically.</p>

<p>Anyway, a Proper Lady (Katie) comes to town and becomes friends with Calam, helping her discover her feminine side (I know, I know, just bear with me) and Bill falls unconvincingly in love with her. But when Danny and Katie are discovered KISSING, Calam loses it and threatens to run Katie out of town. She makes a right fool of herself, and Danny is mean about her, but Bill Hickok defends her and goes to console/talk some sense into a bereft Calam. On a still summer night, in a wood, under a silvery moon, etc… they kiss, and conveniently enough it turns out they’ve been in love all along! Everyone makes friends again, Calam marries Bill and Katie marries Danny, even though he’s a knob.</p>
<p>Okay. So there are some tough bits, most notably the repeated references to “female thinking”, and the godawful <a title="YouTube - A Woman's Touch" href="http://youtu.be/swYl_rFe7Qk" target="_blank"><strong>A Woman’s Touch</strong></a> song. I get through this by donning slash goggles, through which it all becomes rather charming and ironic.</p>
<p>There’s even a symbolic castration of Calam at the end when she and Bill get married – they’re just getting on the stagecoach and he finds she has her gun tucked into her wedding dress. They all laugh and he hands it to some random in the crowd. Then they ride off singing etc.</p>
<p>BUT. There is a lot that is loveable about this film, and it’s not as bad as the details above might suggest.</p>
<p>Firstly, Doris Day’s Calam is a wonderful character. Brave, kind, funny and bursting with energy, she leaps about all over the place, and has a habit of firing at the ceiling to get people’s attention. She’s a tomboy but she’s no freak – everyone in the town is fond of her, respects her and humours her habit of exaggerating her own exploits. She’s accepted, not just tolerated. Her flaw is her pride, and the real point of the story is that it’s her pride which is ‘corrected’ and not her masculine habits.</p>
<p>Secondly, although she is engirlied, she doesn’t become a 50s fembot. She wears a few dresses, but mostly she’s out of her buckskins yet still in trousers. There’s no sign at all she’s going to give up riding the stage (or violently oppressing the indigenous population). I think my favourite bit in the whole film is near the end when she’s racing after Katie’s coach to bring her back to Deadwood, and she passes Bill and his mate on her horse. She thunders past, then stops, turns, rides back, kisses him, and rides off again without a word.</p>
<p>His friend says “I don&#8217;t know what kind of life you&#8217;ll have living with that catamount&#8230; but it ain&#8217;t gonna be dull.”</p>
<p>Bill replies: “That&#8217;s for dang sure.” He looks delighted.</p>
<p>Thirdly, although it arrives at a supremely convenient time in that way that musicals have, the relationship between Calam and Bill is a convincing one. Throughout the film there are references to their friendship and campaigns together, and they are clearly fond of each other. He sticks up for her when Danny is being disparaging, and tells her early on he thinks she’d be pretty (if she was a Proper Lady, natch). So when Calamity ‘takes off her glasses’ at the Ball (in fact she’s been covered up in a coat she claims was given to her by General Custer) it isn’t as if he’s only just noticed her. And crucially, rather than trying to put her down or get her to act in a more feminine way, his efforts are about bringing her down to earth from her flights of fancy and towering pride.</p>
<p>It’s not a feminist film. It’s not even <em>close</em>. But Calamity is wonderful, and I think better a film with her in it than not at all.</p>
<p>PS.   The title is a reference to the most famous song in the film, <a title="YouTube - Secret Love" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZALA7sPhYU" target="_blank"><strong>Secret Love</strong></a>, which has become a bit of a gay anthem. My favourite is <a title="YouTube - The Black Hills of Dakota" href="http://youtu.be/p59nrGixAYY" target="_blank"><strong>The Black Hills Of Dakota</strong></a>, although it has a lot less subtext.</p>
<p>PPS.  Don&#8217;t come to this film looking for historical accuracy. Here&#8217;s <a title="Powells Review" href="http://www.powells.com/review/2005_12_30.html" target="_blank">some info</a> on the actual <a title="Wikipedia Image - Calamity Jane" href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Calamity_jane.jpeg/220px-Calamity_jane.jpeg" target="_blank">Calamity Jane</a> and <a title="Wikipedia Image - Wild Bill Hickok" href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Wild_Bill.jpg/220px-Wild_Bill.jpg" target="_blank">Wild Bill Hickok</a>.</p>

<p>Much has been said about his words, but a lot of the online discussion focuses on &#8220;I now think he&#8217;s a douche&#8221; and not on why the post should be regarded as offensive. Well, I&#8217;m pretty clear on why I find it offensive.</p>
<p>In my posts for BadRep I have often expressed the sentiment that <A href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/12/16/big-dog/" />men have unique problems in society</a>, and that those problems are just as invisible as some feminist issues. I believe it&#8217;s true. I&#8217;ve also recently written a post which stated my feelings on the constant cry of &#8220;<A href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/03/24/but-what-about-teh-menz/" />but what about the men?</a>&#8221; in response to feminist discussion. Short answer: if you look at the world and don&#8217;t see massive gender inequality harming women a lot more than men, and don&#8217;t think that reducing the gap (and aiming to eliminate these issues for everyone) would be a good thing, then I don&#8217;t want to know you.</p>
<p>Scott Adams didn&#8217;t say that feminism was no longer needed, or that men have bigger problems than women. His post can be summed up in two parts:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Now I would like to speak directly to my male readers who feel unjustly treated by the widespread suppression of men’s rights:</p>
<p>Get over it, you bunch of pussies.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Why would he say that &#8211; because he sees women&#8217;s rights as far more under attack? Er&#8230; no. He has this advice instead:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The reality is that women are treated differently by society for exactly the same reason that children and the mentally handicapped are treated differently. It’s just easier this way for everyone. You don’t argue with a four-year old about why he shouldn’t eat candy for dinner. You don’t punch a mentally handicapped guy even if he punches you first. And you don’t argue when a women tells you she’s only making 80 cents to your dollar. It’s the path of least resistance. You save your energy for more important battles.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Scott states that he&#8217;s <em>not</em> comparing &#8216;women&#8217; directly to &#8216;people with disabilities&#8217; or children, but does advise his (male) audience to treat them all the same way &#8211; to take into account the &#8220;emotional realities of other people&#8221;.</p>
<p>And this is where most online discussion is only just starting to get it. It doesn&#8217;t MATTER if he&#8217;s right, or if he&#8217;s a realist. Either way this is shitty, inhumane advice.</p>
<p>It puts the reader in the group taking action, and puts women (and other humans with inconvenient &#8217;emotional realities&#8217;) in a group marked &#8220;Other&#8221;. And as we all know, that&#8217;s classic 101 to dehumanising your target and making it easier to see them as objects who don&#8217;t need to be considered. It&#8217;s also bollocks. He&#8217;s giving instructions for how to manipulate others for your own success, without looking at any possibility of finding any common ground, sharing boundaries, or viewing them as real people who could be talked to. They&#8217;re just there to be made to go away with the least stress to him. Adams is dismissing the idea that his current views could be <em>wrong</em> and that he might learn something from women, because dialogue is not an option. He&#8217;d rather choose the path of least resistance. That&#8217;s a pretty closed mind right there.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not easier for &#8220;everyone&#8221;, Scott. Just you. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s not easier for women, for example. Also: women, children and &#8220;the mentally handicapped&#8221;(!) are together a <em>majority</em>, which makes you sitting inside your privileged minority and dismissing them like this all the more craptastic. The majority of the human race are more emotional than you, Scott, and as you&#8217;ve just demonstrated probably have more empathy too.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the post he says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Fairness is an illusion. It’s unobtainable in the real world.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>For someone who has spent decades writing about the inhumanity of big business, that&#8217;s a surprising quote. And my inner Hopeless Idealist rejects it totally. Yes, men face different inequalities: in the divorce courts, in countries with a military draft, in society&#8217;s ancient ideas of what &#8216;masculine&#8217; behaviour is. But even if I felt that these somehow matched the towering mountain of (frequently lethal) inequality facing women (which I don&#8217;t by several miles), I would never give up on seeking fairness. It&#8217;s an instinctive, empathic, humane response which shows that you&#8217;re a decent human being.</p>
<p>So yeah, I now think Scott Adams is a douche as well. Several additional words spring to mind (the lovely <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/about/">Miranda</a> put in a vote for &#8220;ableist asshat&#8221; at this juncture). If you want to read his justifications (that he often takes the point of view on his blog which is most difficult to defend, that his readers know he often doesn&#8217;t even believe the argument he&#8217;s making, that we&#8217;re all devoid of &#8220;reading comprehension&#8221;) then you can wander over to where he&#8217;s currently <A href="http://www.feministe.us/blog/archives/2011/03/24/scott-adams-to-mens-rights-activists-dont-bother-arguing-with-women-theyre-like-children">trolling the comment thread at Feministe.</a> Yes, seriously. At no time does he back down from the opinion he stated, or acknowledge how the act of grouping 51% of the planet and more into an &#8216;overly emotional&#8217; box to be safely ignored for his own mental peace of mind is in any way douche-worthy.</p>
<p>We are better than his exclusionary, patronising bullshit, people. There&#8217;s an alternative where we keep talking, and learning, and looking for ways to make a society we can be proud of. Together. Because women are human beings, and the fact that this still needs saying means that <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/10/12/the-bottom-rung-of-the-ladder">all men should be jumping aboard the feminism boat</a> for joint rock n&#8217; roll pirate adventures. The alternative is a land run by people as ignorant, reactionary and self-absorbed as the boss in the Dilbert comics, and no-one wins when that happens.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/01/11/avatar--no-the-other-one/">written previously for BadRep</a> on how the cartoon series <strong>Avatar: The Last Airbender</strong> is very feminist-friendly in its treatment of female characters. Women have important roles, the prejudices they face are explored and ridiculed, and they are counted as the most effective and capable warriors. There are equal numbers of them compared to the men in the group, and while the lead character is male that fact becomes almost unimportant in the weave of personal stories from the whole team.</p>
<p>A new 12-part miniseries is being made, this time with a female character in the title role. This image of her has been released and is doing the rounds on fan blogs and so on, and some of the comments which have greeted it are very interesting.</p>

<p>Here are some of the initial replies I&#8217;ve seen (not exact wording):</p>
<ul>
<li><em>&#8220;Why does she look like a boy?&#8221;</em></li>
<li><em>&#8220;She looks well butch.&#8221;</em></li>
<li> <em>&#8220;Take the pigtails out and you have a dude.&#8221;</em></li>
</ul>
<p>All of which might arguably be true, but that&#8217;s firmly in the tradition of <strong>Avatar</strong> playing with gender in awesome ways.  For a start, the character of the Avatar is a holy person who has reincarnated as male and female over the centuries. They have a long line of both to call on for wisdom during meditation.</p>

<p>In the original series, the Avatar is a boy named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aang"><strong>Aang</strong></a>, who presents as relatively gender-neutral: his young age and upbringing as a monk make him quite androgynous, his head has no hair or facial hair and he wears mainly shapeless robes. While physical power and combat are key measures of success for the world he lives in, Aang refuses to take the hyper-masculine pose which is constantly encouraged. He is instead always flying out of reach and using his enemies&#8217; aggression to quickly slip behind them to safety (a key technique of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ba_gua">Ba Gua</a> martial art which his tribe learn). He doesn&#8217;t judge or take sides, but is laughingly delighted to meet anyone. He has been away from the world, and society&#8217;s restrictions on gender simply make no sense to him compared to love for your fellow beings. Expectations of male and female conduct are explored (and often refuted) by everyone around him, but he stands alone in the centre. He is a pacifist trickster, unique in the world.</p>
<p>Tricksters in mythology are often linked to exploration of gender roles. They can be shapeshifters, disguise themselves as anyone, and try out, or even master, traditional women&#8217;s or men&#8217;s skills. Shamans in some communities (who can in many ways embody the trickster role) may not consider themselves to be male or female: some cross-dress, or adopt the conventions of different gender roles at different times. Tricksters are also usually Outsiders. They all know loneliness and derision, and can only succeed in their task if they do NOT fit the safe confines of known social roles. Aang is definitely an Outsider, and the lonely last of his kind.</p>
<p>The fact that the series can do all this while still being a genuinely thrilling, hilarious and entertaining children&#8217;s show is just one of its strengths (do you get the impression I like it quite a lot?) The attitude of neutrality with regard to gender isn&#8217;t laboured, and as the episodes progress Aang develops a hetero attraction towards a female character, but by that point it doesn&#8217;t feel like it was inevitable in a Hollywood kind of way.</p>
<p>When we look at who the commenters expected <strong>Korra</strong> to be like, the closest fit is probably the main female of the original group &#8211; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katara_(Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender)"><strong>Katara</strong></a>, a teenage girl who, like Korra, also comes from the Water Tribe. Katara has complete agency over her actions and repeatedly refuses to fit into everyone&#8217;s expectations for what &#8216;a girl&#8217; should be able to do. She does take on the familiar female roles of healer and nurturer, but only after proving she is as strong and determined as the men around her and <em>choosing</em> the additional activities for herself. Demanding them, in fact, when there is so much which she rejects and fights against as well. But at the end of the day&#8230; she is also very conventionally pretty.</p>
<p><strong>Korra</strong> doesn&#8217;t give the studios that reassurance. You can usually be as liberal as you like in a new show &#8211; provided you have a white male lead. I think <strong>Avatar: TLA</strong> did the minimum it had to in order to be made, and took great risks after it had snuck in under the radar. <strong>Avatar: TLK</strong> isn&#8217;t putting up with that nonsense at all, has a teenage young woman of colour as the protagonist and (if the previous writers were anything to go by) will not be taking any crap about it.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t wait to see what Nickelodeon do with Korra, and in many ways &#8220;she&#8217;s not feminine-looking enough!&#8221; is a wonderful comment to have provoked. Television for children is SO important in terms of teaching norms to a new generation. The original depicts the heroes observing the world around them, <em>choosing for themselves</em> which parts to take into their life, and being treated with honour and respect no matter who they feel they are. I just wish we were getting more than a 12-part miniseries this time!</p>
