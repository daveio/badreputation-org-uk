<p><strong>CONTENT NOTE:</strong> Discussions herein of sexual assault, dubious consent, mental health treated badly, homophobia, biphobia and slut-shaming. Oh, and plenty of spoilers.</p>
<p>Welcome back to <strong>Hopeless Reimantic Presents</strong>! <a href="/2013/12/04/hopeless-reimantic-presents-anita-blake-vampire-hunter-part-one" target="_blank">Last time we got our teeth into <strong>Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter</strong></a>, and I found myself actually saying some pretty positive things about the books. (Honestly, I&#8217;m as surprised as you. My fourteen-year-old self is throwing one hell of a sulk.) It&#8217;s not the full story, though, and there&#8217;s still quite a lot about this series to unpack.</p>
<p>First of all, there&#8217;s something I need to make clear: as I said in <a href="/2013/12/04/hopeless-reimantic-presents-anita-blake-vampire-hunter-part-one" target="_blank">Part One</a>, I went into this review determined not to talk about the series in relation to Laurell K. Hamilton herself more than was necessary.</p>
<p>I generally hold that unless an author has done something that I can&#8217;t reconcile myself to morally, I don&#8217;t feel like it&#8217;s my business to talk about their personal life when I am supposed to be reviewing their books. And from what I&#8217;ve read of Laurell K. Hamilton&#8217;s blog posts, she seems kind of entitled and I find her annoying, but&#8230;well, let&#8217;s just say that as far as I can tell she&#8217;s no Orson Scott Card. By and large my problems with the ideas she puts across can easily be expressed in criticism of her work rather than criticism of her.</p>
<p>I ran into some problems with this approach, to be sure; the evidence for Anita Blake being the author&#8217;s avatar is pretty compelling. But for the purposes of analysing the text, I&#8217;m putting that debate to bed. From here on out, guys, they&#8217;re just books, so if anyone is reading this expecting it to be a catalogue of Ms Hamilton&#8217;s character flaws, well, it&#8217;s not going to be. Hashtag sorry not sorry, or something.</p>
<p>Oh, one more thing: I&#8217;m limiting myself to a maximum of one book quotation per point here, because SEVENTEEN BOOKS LORD HAVE MERCY.</p>
<p>Okay! Let&#8217;s get started. Where were we? Was I wanting to tear my eyes out? I think I was wanting to tear my eyes out.</p>
<p>&#8230;I&#8217;m going to need to slip into a more concise format, I think, or that&#8217;s just going to be the entire article. Here, then, in no particular order, are My Main Problems with Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter:</p>
<h3>1) Anita only has one dating experience that I would describe as fully consensual.</h3>
<p>She dates Richard, a werewolf, and then she gets engaged to Richard, and <em>then</em> the vampire she&#8217;s been hanging out with decides that he needs &#8220;equal time&#8221; to win her over, or he&#8217;s got no choice but to duel Richard to the death:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;You have dated him for months, and I have said little. Before you marry him, I want equal time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been trying to avoid you for months. I&#8217;m not just going to give in now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I will start the music, and we will dance. Even if I die, and you die. Richard will die first, I can promise you that. Surely dating me is not a fate worse than death.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8211; Laurell K. Hamilton, <strong>The Lunatic Cafe</strong>, p.221.</p></blockquote>
<p>(I&#8217;m not so sure about that, dude.)</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also the shapeshifter leopard who basically just rapes her (it&#8217;s okay, she enjoys it) and then is her mate and it&#8217;s all fine, and the other shapeshifter leopard who is Terrifyingly Submissive at her until she gives in (more on that later). These are her four main men and, last I checked, the various loves of her life.</p>
<p>There are a couple of things at play here, and I can intellectually grasp them both. One is that an easy way to add darkness and tension to a story is to have your main character interact with a world which doesn&#8217;t recognise their morality, which is how we get all those kind of racist &#8220;I was ravished by a barbarian/sheikh/otherwise rich and dark-skinned man&#8221; stories (remind me to talk to you about <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2180276.The_Panther_and_the_Pearl" target="_blank"><strong>The Panther And The Pearl</strong></a> some time). And that&#8217;s not necessarily a bad thing in a fantasy world where you are dealing with beings that might have witnessed the greater part of human history. I do take the point that you might well not care so much about pesky human morals when you&#8217;ve been living off blood or sex or male tears or whatever for about a thousand years.</p>
<p>And, credit where it&#8217;s due, Laurell K. Hamilton does make some effort to deal with the effect this is having on Anita; she agonises, at least initially, over the detachment she feels from her humanity as she gets drawn deeper into the preternatural world. Hamilton doesn&#8217;t really take that conflict anywhere, which is a shame because it makes the whole thing feel a bit too insta-conflict for my liking, but she tries.</p>
<p>The considerably more disturbing thing is the second point, which is that this is supposed to be <em>hot</em>. We&#8217;ve touched on this before in <a href="/2013/04/23/hopeless-reimantic-3-pack-mentality/" target="_blank">the column on alpha males</a>, but one thing that I think I missed there is actually what I find grossest about this particular fantasy &#8211; that being threatened or coerced, either physically or by other means, into being with someone is supposed to be evidence of part of a woman&#8217;s power and mystique. It&#8217;s not that these guys are proto-rapists, no &#8211; it&#8217;s that women are so damned irresistible that they overwhelm men&#8217;s judgement and common sense. Basically, they are the full moon to every man&#8217;s <a href="http://pervocracy.blogspot.co.uk/2012/08/the-myth-of-boner-werewolf.html" target="_blank">boner werewolf</a> (link NSFW).</p>
<p>There is an element of pick-up artistry that states that when you overcome LMR (last minute resistance, usually to sex) you&#8217;re actually doing the woman a favour, because you&#8217;re taking the responsibility out of her hands. She can&#8217;t be a slut, because she&#8217;s not in control; you&#8217;re preserving her purity while still giving her the sex she wants. That is gross and messed-up and a terrible bit of rape apologia, but it&#8217;s the same kind of logic that I&#8217;m seeing here; it&#8217;s a way to skirt around having Anita own her own sexuality. She can&#8217;t help it! She&#8217;s just got this <em>energy</em>!</p>
<p>And on that note&#8230;</p>
<h3>2) There&#8217;s hella slut-shaming.</h3>
<p>It took me a while to realise this. I started out with <strong>Danse Macabre</strong>, but the more of these books I read, the more I became convinced that having lots of sex was only okay for Anita Blake, and by extension her harem of men, because Anita Blake has sex because she somehow <em>has</em> to &#8211; which is a pretty icky sentence to begin with, by the way. </p>
<p>Anita starts out the series not believing in pre-marital sex. She ends up having quite a lot of it, but there&#8217;s never a sense that she revises that belief, which would be really interesting if it didn&#8217;t have such weird implications for the other women in the books. Anita has sex because of deep love, a deep sense of obligation (erk) and/or because she is a succubus. Metaphysical events or very strong emotion compel her to bone, and the fact that she ends up enjoying it immensely is somehow a coincidence, which is possibly the strangest permutation of the forced seduction trope I&#8217;ve ever seen. </p>
<p>And even that would be okay, were it not for the fact that every single other woman in the books who has sex for such a frivolous reason as the fact she just enjoys it is painted as either a) shallow and heinous, b) mentally unstable, or c) both.</p>
<p>Which brings me neatly to:</p>
<h3>3) There is gratuitous use of mental illness as a plot device.</h3>
<p>Basically every villain is crazy. And there&#8217;s Nathaniel, her second shapeshifter love interest, who is super-submissive and utterly traumatised by his past and hey, did we mention he&#8217;s kinky too and can take more pain than anybody else? Because he&#8217;s damaged?</p>
<p>Urgh. If I had to hazard, I&#8217;d say this follows a lot of the same logic that we see in point 1), but let&#8217;s just be honest here; this isn&#8217;t just offensive, it&#8217;s lazy writing, in the same way that blaming serious criminal offences or terrorism on mental illness is lazy journalism. It&#8217;s a way to avoid grappling seriously with what could actually be some pretty compelling issues and it&#8217;s depressing me. So let&#8217;s move on to our final point:</p>
<h3>4) Gender essentialism and homophobia.</h3>
<p>Hoo boy.</p>
<p>This is a pretty interesting one, actually, because the characters around Anita Blake actually call her on some of it, and it doesn&#8217;t work. I skipped a quotation for mental illness and point 2, so we can have two in here because it&#8217;s my column and I make the rules.</p>
<p>I feel like I need to include this one because it&#8217;s in <strong>Shutdown</strong>, which was actually only released <a href="http://www.laurellkhamilton.org/2013/10/shutdown-press-release/" target="_blank">a few weeks ago</a> &#8211; and, again, in fairness to Ms Hamilton, releasing it the way she did was a nice idea (it was a freebie because of the US government shutdown, in solidarity with government workers who were off without pay). </p>
<p>The story itself is interesting purely because the premise is so flawed: Richard, Anita Blake&#8217;s erstwhile lover, now-Top, is engaged to another woman, and apparently has chosen only now to mention to her that he&#8217;s poly and wants to see other people for wild kinky sex. His fiancee has a problem with this &#8211; not, you understand, because somehow <em>they have got as far as being engaged without this ever having come up</em>, but because she&#8217;s a crazy jealous harpy who can&#8217;t wrap her narrow mind around non-monogamy or sex that isn&#8217;t vanilla. </p>
<p>I liked precisely nobody in this short, but Anita least of all:</p>
<blockquote><p>I hadn&#8217;t had to endure this much small talk in years. We&#8217;d learned a lot about one another, but unless we were looking to date, I didn&#8217;t see the point.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Men understood that sometimes you didn&#8217;t want to smile, but you weren&#8217;t mad either, while women expect other women to be pleasant, and if you&#8217;re not they think you don&#8217;t like them. There are so many reasons that most of my friends are men. </p>
<p>&#8211; Laurell K. Hamilton, <strong>Shutdown</strong>, pp.6-8</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh, Ms Blake, you charmer. I could quote this little piece all day, actually, because it shows you a lot about the mess of contradictions that is gender portrayal in these books, but &#8211; you guys, I can&#8217;t. I just can&#8217;t. I think my brain is leaking out of my ears.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s finish up, then, with one final quote, and my witty and insightful riposte.</p>
<p>Look, okay, this isn&#8217;t even close to the most homophobia I&#8217;ve ever seen in fiction, or the worst. I&#8217;ll give you that I really do think this was&#8230; misguided, but well-intentioned. For what that&#8217;s worth. But the fact remains that I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve seen a non-heterosexual character in the Anita Blake series who wasn&#8217;t sex-obsessed, mentally ill (see above) and/or just plain old mean. </p>
<p>Anita Blake herself later gets a girlfriend and starts identifying as &#8220;heteroflexible&#8221;, which is a completely valid label that I don&#8217;t wish to detract from, but in this case reads to me sort of like she&#8217;s just started adding &#8220;no homo&#8221; to the end of all of her sentences about fancying women.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s&#8230;well, this. For context: some of Anita&#8217;s male partners are bisexual. She has just had a threesome with one of them and another man, which she feels gives her incontrovertible proof that he is, in fact, also into guys. The other men around her do not seem bothered by this revelation. Which prompts the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In college I had a friend, a girlfriend, a girl who was a friend. She and I went shopping together. Slept over at each other&#8217;s dorm rooms. I undressed in front of her because she was a girl. Then toward the end of college she told me she was gay. We were still friends, but she went into that guy category for me. You don&#8217;t undress in front of people who see you as a sex object. You don&#8217;t sleep with them, or&#8230;oh, hell.&#8221; I looked up at Micah. &#8220;Won&#8217;t it weird you out to sleep nude beside him now?&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8211; Laurell K. Hamilton, <strong>Danse Macabre</strong>, p.188.</p></blockquote>
<p>Funny story: my original response to this paragraph was a lot more colourful. I&#8217;m going to try and discuss it briefly, coherently and without expletives.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure which bothers me more, here: the idea that being attracted to members of one gender means you&#8217;re attracted to <em>all</em> members of one gender, or Anita&#8217;s assumption that everybody around her is going to have the same weird hang-ups as she is. I will say, though, that reading this made me briefly see red. You can come hang out with my friends, Anita Blake&#8217;s token lesbian college friend! They&#8217;ll hug you! Even the straight women!</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m struggling to articulate is why, exactly, this paragraph was the exact point that I fully lost patience with the series, because in context it&#8217;s not actually so bad. Anita is laughed at for her small-mindedness, and they all go to sleep naked and it&#8217;s fine.</p>
<p>Except&#8230;</p>
<p>Except that <em>this never really goes away</em>. There&#8217;s a kind of false normal here that you&#8217;re not supposed to stray from, and then even when Anita does, all that happens it that it gets this veneer of &#8220;exotic sexy sex stuff&#8221; that makes the books transgressive and naughty. It doesn&#8217;t read like a straight-up sex fantasy. I definitely don&#8217;t buy that it&#8217;s an honest exploration of sexuality in fiction. I&#8217;m not even sure that it&#8217;s Laurell K. Hamilton bragging about her sex life with extra fantasy elements.</p>
<p>The best way I can describe it is that it reads like a zoo exhibit, if people who have a lot of sex could actually literally <em>be</em> zoo exhibits. It doesn&#8217;t challenge normative attitudes, is what I&#8217;m saying. It takes the stuff Ms Hamilton describes as &#8220;too underground for the mainstream&#8221; and sticks it behind a thick layer of societal assumptions-reinforced glass, so that you can look at it without getting your brain too into all the sex stuff. And then you can go home at the end feeling like you&#8217;ve learned something. And perhaps a little icky.</p>
<p>And that brings us to the end of <strong>Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter</strong>. If you enjoyed this column and want me to do more like it, consider dropping me a comment, because the experience was&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;it was&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;it&#8217;s been an experience, guys. And now, if you&#8217;ll excuse me, I&#8217;m off to read something else. Something gentle, with no sex in it whatsoever. Maybe some Catherynne M. Valente.</p>
<p>See you next time!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[It's hard to find a way to re-appropriate any of these ideas in a positive way. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Hodge-note:</strong> This rather special item from the archives was originally #22 in the <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/category/alphabet/" target="_blank">Alphabet series</a>, and got mostly written (and illustrated) before I heard the siren song of <strong>vitriol</strong> instead, with its rich murder and rage connotations. <a title="V is for Vitriol" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/03/21/an-alphabet-of-feminism-22-v-is-for-vitriol/" target="_blank"><strong>Vitriol</strong></a> was duly inducted into the Alphabet official rankings and <strong>Virgin</strong> languished like a vestal until we thought maybe she should see the light of day&#8230;</p>
<p>Here she is:</p>
<h6 style="text-align: center;">V</h6>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">VIRGIN</h2>
<blockquote><p>And your quaint honour turn to dust<br />
And into ashes all my lust&#8230;</p>
<p>Andrew Marvell, <strong>To His Coy Mistress </strong>c.1640s</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Virgin</em> has a comparatively straightforward etymology: it derives from the Latin <em>virgo </em>(= &#8216;maiden&#8217;), whence the star-sign Virgo (apparently the sign of the shy, modest and meticulous, with a dash of perfectionism and anxiety). Its first sense (c.1200) is an ecclesiastical one: &#8216;an unmarried or chaste maiden or women, distinguished for piety or steadfastness in religion, and regarded as having a special place among the members of the Christian church on account of these merits.&#8217;</p>
<h2>Like a virgin</h2>

<p>There are innumerable such virgins in Christian hagiography: Saint Ursula had an army of 11,000 virgin handmaids who all had their heads chopped off (in a bit of a pun-fail); Saint Cecilia (patron saint of music) managed not only to persuade her husband to forbear on their wedding night, but also to join the Christian cause along with his brother, and suffer death in consequence.</p>
<p>Saint Lucy consecrated her virginity to God, and, supposedly, tore her own eyes out and gave them to her husband (who had admired them) as a kind of macabre substitute for the marital debt. (Lesson: never admire your girlfriend&#8217;s essential organs).</p>
<p>And, of course, there is the arch-virgin much mentioned in these posts – the eponymous Mary, who gets a definition all to herself as <em>virgin</em>&#8216;s fourth meaning.</p>
<p>Mary&#8217;s particular achievement &#8211; the Virgin Birth &#8211; is also considered of some importance in these definitions for <em>virgin</em>. It presumably lies behind the gloss &#8216;a female insect producing fertile <a title="O is for Ovary" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/01/24/an-alphabet-of-femininism-15-o-is-for-ovary/" target="_blank">eggs</a> by pathenogenesis [without the input of a male insect]&#8217; (1883), as well as <em>virgin</em>&#8216;s simple equivalence with &#8216;pathenogenesis&#8217; itself (1849) &#8211; a word with its origin in the Greek <em>parthenos</em>, also meaning &#8216;virgin&#8217; and &#8216;genesis&#8217; (= &#8216;creation&#8217;).</p>
<p>This &#8211; reproduction without fertilisation &#8211; though clearly associated with Mary in Christian tradition, is also arguably the origin of Adam, so it doesn&#8217;t have to be have an explicit cultural gender-association. Indeed, there is a Middle English citation for <em>virgin </em>that defines it as <span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">&#8216;a youth or man who has remained in a state of chastity&#8217;. But this is admittedly an unusual example among the definitions as a whole. </span></p>
<h2>A woman&#8217;s touch</h2>

<p>If we go back to ancient Rome, we meet another sense the religious meaning of <em>virgin</em> can have: the very non-Christian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestal_Virgin" target="_blank">Vestal Virgins</a>, a group of highly respected women whose job it was to guard the &#8216;sacred fire&#8217; and take care of the rituals and responsibilities that could not be dealt with by male priests.</p>
<p>They were so named because their duties were primarily to Vesta, the Roman goddess of the hearth and family, and, in consequence, the Vestal Virgins took on a role as kind of symbolic housewives to the whole of Rome.</p>
<p>Though they would be obliged to remain <em>virginal </em>throughout their time as priestesses, in the word&#8217;s second sense &#8216;a woman who is or remains in a state of inviolate chastity&#8217;, the vow only lasted thirty years, at the end of which they were free to marry (though most of them seem not to have been all that bothered).</p>
<p>This all said, while these saints and priestesses are all very much <em>virgins </em>in the most common sense of the word, the ecclesiastical meaning does not have to imply the sexual inexperience they normally connote, since &#8216;chastity&#8217; simply means &#8216;clean, pure&#8217; (from the Latin <em>castus</em>), and has no intrinsic connection with physical &#8216;intactness&#8217;, though it is frequently used as a synonym. In fact, the fourth definition for the second primary meaning of the word (where it can be used to describe things other than women) highlights &#8216;purity or freedom from stain&#8217; and being &#8216;unsullied&#8217;.</p>
<p>If you cast your mind back to &#8216;<a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/01/10/an-alphabet-of-femininism-13-m-is-for-marriage/" target="_blank">M is for Marriage</a>&#8216;, you may remember that <em>adultery </em>means &#8216;pollution of the marriage bed&#8217;, suggesting by association that the marriage bed was a sacred – or indeed &#8216;pure&#8217; – space. And indeed, marriage was widely considered invalid without consummation – something Henry VIII made much use of in his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_of_Cleves#A_doomed_marriage" target="_blank">royal divorces </a>– and, in consequence, the virtuous wife who dexterously trod the balance of Pure Marital Sex and Pollution of the Marriage Bed (whether by adultery as we conceive it, or by lusting after her husband) could be as much feted as the unmarried <em>virgin </em>(indeed, more so, if she proved herself skilled in housewifery and produced equally virtuous children).</p>

<p>That said, a curious and related term first cited in 1644 was <em>virgin widow</em>, meaning a woman whose husband had died before the marriage could be consummated, and whose status was therefore ambiguously poised between <em>virginity </em>(in the sense of being unmarried) and <a title="W is for Widow" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/03/28/an-alphabet-of-feminism-23-w-is-for-widow/" target="_blank"><em>widowhood </em></a>(being left behind after the death of a husband).</p>
<p>This was <a title="LRB Catherine of Aragon" href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v33/n15/eamon-duffy/the-unlikeliest-loophole" target="_blank">Catherine of Aragon</a>&#8216;s position, as argued at her divorce hearing, during the painful period  after Prince Arthur&#8217;s death &#8211; languishing in a political and social limbo, waiting for something to happen, steadily running out of money and losing points on the marriage market.</p>
<h2>Purity is a virtue of the soul</h2>
<p>An excellent, though somewhat horrific, example of the noble wife trope is <a title="Lucretia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucretia" target="_blank">Lucretia</a>, the virtuous spouse of Collatine, whose rape by the royal prince Tarquin so outraged Rome that it led directly to the establishment of the Roman republic. As a wife, Lucretia is not a technical <em>virgin</em>, but she is (as Shakespeare puts it in the oft-forgotten early poem <strong>The</strong> <strong>Rape of Lucrece </strong>(1594)) &#8216;Collatine&#8217;s fair love, Lucrece the <em>chaste</em>&#8216;.</p>
<p>Saint <a title="Augustine" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo" target="_blank">Augustine</a> posits that &#8216;<a title="Augustine" href="http://faculty.washington.edu/miceal/lgw/lucretia/Augustine.html" target="_blank">purity is a virtue of the soul</a>&#8216;, and since body and soul are (in this reading) distinct, Lucrece can consummate her marriage while still retaining her essential &#8216;bodily sanctity&#8217; because she is free of polluting lust in the process.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Unfortunately, Collatine spends so much time bragging about his wife&#8217;s chastity to the bros in the camp that he invites trouble:</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Haply that name of &#8220;chaste&#8221; unhapp&#8217;ly set<br />
The bateless edge on [Tarquin&#8217;s] appetite</p>
<p>Shakespeare, <strong>The Rape of Lucrece</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Lucretia is so traumatised by Tarquin&#8217;s subsequent rape that she stabs herself rather than &#8216;live impure&#8217;, widely considered by the (male) world to be a Noble Decision. This led to her immortalisation in literature and philosophy as a perfect wife, but also prompted Augustine to engage in some terrible rape apologism in the service of his broader argument (</span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">&#8216;If she was adulterous, why praise her? if chaste, why slay her?&#8217;).</span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><br />
</span></p>
<h2>Saints and sieves</h2>
<p>It is presumably a version of this chastity-of-the-soul idea so beloved by Augustine that lies behind the story of Tuccia, the Vestal Virgin who proves her virginity by carrying water from the Tiber in a sieve without spilling a drop (<a title="Tuccia" href="http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/upload/img/moroni-vestal-virgin-tuccia-NG3123-fm.jpg" target="_blank">here she is </a>depicted in 1555 with the sieve itself, and wearing an outfit that leaves little to the imagination, chaste or otherwise).</p>
<p>I suppose the idea behind the sieve story is that something that would normally flow through the porous surface is maintained &#8216;intact&#8217;, perhaps representing the pure soul within a porous body. At any rate, it became a key symbol of virginity, most notably in the &#8216;Sieve Portrait&#8217; of the &#8216;<a title="Q is for Queen" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/02/07/an-alphabet-of-femininism-17-q-is-for-queen/" target="_blank">Virgin Queen</a>&#8216; Elizabeth I, who is also cited in the Dictionary as a definition of <i>virgin </i>in herself.</p>
<p>The last citation given in the dictionary for <em>virgin</em>, with which we will end, is from 1780, as &#8216;a fortress or city that has never been taken or subdued&#8217;. This has an obvious resonance with Lucrece, and the ultimately martial tale her story becomes &#8211; another link between feminine &#8216;closedness&#8217; and men&#8217;s military convenience.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to find a way to re-appropriate any of these ideas in a positive way. But maybe this transferred definition or fortresses and cities should make us think about Elizabeth I, who at least made them work to her own military and political advantage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li><em>First things first: there&#8217;s a trigger warning on this post for discussion of (and links to discussion of) sexual assault, racism, homophobia, transphobia and generally insultingly bad advertising &#8211; take care when clicking the links.

<p>Everyone approaches veganism from a different angle.</p>
<p>Some vegans find their way into it through kindness and empathy for living creatures; others are swayed by hard facts and shocking images. Neither is more or less agreeable, and I suspect that in our day-to-day lives, most vegans use a combination of both when faced with questions from curious veggie or omni friends.</p>

PETA’s ongoing <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/08/13/national/main777016.shtml" target="_blank">racist</a>, <a href="http://www.womanist-musings.com/2008/09/peta-favourite-animal-is-pussy.html" target="_blank">misogynistic</a>, <a href="http://www.womanist-musings.com/2009/02/peta-goes-lesbian.html" target="_blank">homophobic</a>, <a href="http://thecolonic.blogspot.co.uk/2009/02/using-transphobia-to-fight-animal-abuse.html" target="_blank">transphobic</a> and <a href="http://media.treehugger.com/assets/images/2011/10/peta-save-whales-billboard.jpg" target="_blank">fat-shaming</a> ads and publicity stunts are frequently ripped to pieces online. </p>
<p>Plenty of <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20110911113310AANAUWZ" target="_blank">veg*ns</a> dislike PETA’s controversial tactics, yet many agree that at least their attention-seeking techniques shine a light on the fight and get results, regardless of the harm they cause to others in the process.</p>
<p>PETA are a massive organisation, and they spread a very clear message: animals are not ours to eat, wear, experiment on or use for entertainment – but we’ll appropriate the Holocaust (see below), slavery, women’s bodies, homosexuality and trans* stereotypes to further our cause &#8211; and we don’t give a hoot what oppression we’re supporting in the process.</p>

<p>PETA aren’t the only platform for animal rights, though. Vegans rejoiced a few weeks ago when the beta version of <a href="http://ble.at/" target="_blank"><strong>Ble.at</strong></a> finally went live. For you carnivores not in the loop, Ble.at is a social network for vegans to exchange recipes, activist resources, articles, images and videos. </p>
<p>It’s similar to Tumblr and Twitter insofar as the primary purpose is to upload original content that can then be reblogged (“rebleated”) by fellow vegans. It’s a great way for vegans to connect on a micro level, by spreading awareness of local causes and events, and on a macro level by communicating with vegans on a global scale.</p>
<p>For the first week, it was mostly gifs of piglets, infographics of banana ice cream recipes, and cartoon avocados. With 5,500 profiles created within seven days of the site’s launch, the content rapidly improved: awesome recipes, powerful pro-vegan ads, witty one-liners and inspirational quotes promoting veganism were rife. But unfortunately, so was rape culture.</p>
<p>Due to the reblogging nature of the site, the same images kept popping into my feed: an illustration of an angry cow squeezing the bare breast of a lactating woman, a cartoon of a robot raping a blood-covered cow<sup><a href="/2013/05/27/guest-post-veganism-ble-at-and-rape-culture/#footnote_0_13647" id="identifier_0_13647" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" Ed&rsquo;s Tiny Note: We&rsquo;ve not linked these two as they really are truly unpleasant. They&rsquo;re definitely real, though. ">1</a></sup>, milk being referred to as “rape juice” and the comparison between enjoying the taste of meat to the sexual pleasure a rapist experiences (below right). </p>
<p>Most shocking of all was a video entitled <a href="http://ble.at/videos/597/women-forcefully-milked-in-the-street-269life-animal-rights-performance" target="_blank">“Women forcefully milked in the street”</a>. The short film documents a provocative street performance in which a lactating mother has her baby snatched from her arms by masked men with bloodied hands, who then tear open her blouse to reveal her bare breasts. The rest of the content is in the title. It’s absolutely horrific to watch.</p>

<p>When I mentioned my abhorrence of the casual connection between rape and the dairy industry on Twitter, a vegan pal asked, “What else would you call it?”</p>
<p>Well, the industry term for the bench on which female cows are artificially inseminated is often the “rape rack”, so referring to the process as rape isn’t a particular stretch. But the very fact that this is a common term within the dairy industry is a product of rape culture.</p>
<p>The pig factory employee found forcing metal rods and electrodes into the vaginas of sows is a product of rape culture. The flagrant disregard for the mental health of survivors by flaunting these triggering images to promote veganism is a product of rape culture.</p>
<p>By comparing the industrialised rape and infanticide of the dairy industry to the rape and infanticide of women and children, we are asking non-vegans to project the empathy for the latter onto the suffering of the former. The problem with comparing the dairy industry to rape is that we still live in a rape culture.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we live in a world in which a teenage girl is gang-raped, photographed unconscious by her aggressors <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/national/2013/03/steubenville-rape-twitter-cnn/63349/" target="_blank">and is still blamed</a>. We live in a world in which an accused rapist&#8217;s conviction is overturned because his disabled alleged victim <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/04/richard-fourtin-case-supreme-court-accused-rapist-sexual-assault-handicapped-victim_n_1937528.html" target="_blank">did not resist the attack</a>. We live in a world in which women are threatened with rape on a daily basis and are expected to laugh when comedians <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/07/11/why-daniel-tosh-s-rape-joke-at-the-laugh-factory-wasn-t-funny.html" target="_blank">crack rape jokes</a>. We don’t live in a world that cares enough about the rape of humans for the comparison to be truly effective.</p>
<p>By spreading these images of women being assaulted, we are supporting rape culture, and we are appropriating the suffering and strength of survivors. It is unacceptable to hijack, trigger and traumatise to forward a cause that has so many other convincing arguments to sway potential vegans into ditching the dairy.</p>
<p>Do we really want to be part of a movement that, like PETA, pushes animal rights forward with one hand and shoves civil rights, women’s liberation, LGBTQI rights, issues of race and body positivism aside with the other? That is not my veganism.</p>
<p>To paraphrase <a href="http://tigerbeatdown.com/2011/10/10/my-feminism-will-be-intersectional-or-it-will-be-bullshit/" target="_blank">Flavia Dzodan</a>, my veganism will be intersectional or it will be bullshit. From <a href="http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/29104505" target="_blank">dressing up as the KKK</a> to producing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0vQOnHW0Kc" target="_blank">pro-domestic violence ads</a>, PETA are absolutely rancid, poisonous and unforgivable. It’s also unforgivable to use triggering imagery of women being assaulted to push the vegan agenda.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[There’s nothing that takes us back to basics more than camping. Take away the shower, the clean toilet, the puffs and powers and that whole sleep thing and you’re playing on a level field. Or are you?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This may be an odd way to open an article on a feminist website, but I love Robert Smith. I’m one of the five people in the world who bought <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Join-Dots-B-Sides-Rarities-Cure/dp/B000VRXO6O/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1316719289&#038;sr=8-1">that giant B-sides and rarities four-disc special edition CD</a> when it came out in 2007. So when I heard that the Cure were doing a two-and-a-half-hour set at this year’s <a href="http://www.bestival.net/">Bestival</a>, I packed my camping reservations in a rucksack and duly set off on the Friday to catch the last of our declining summer on the Isle of Wight – and my very first festival. So it goes.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/fest.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="7787" data-permalink="/2011/10/13/festivals-a-feminist-issue/fest/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/fest.jpg?fit=500%2C333&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="500,333" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="fest" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/fest.jpg?fit=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/fest.jpg?fit=500%2C333&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/fest-300x199.jpg?resize=300%2C199" alt="photo showing crowd of people cheering at a music festival.

Take away the shower, the clean toilet, the puffs and powders and that whole sleep thing and you’re playing on a level field. Or are you? After the first set, I watched as scores of men took to the fence, whipped their genitalia out, and relieved themselves with an efficiency almost amounting to elegance. Then a girl and her friend approached, one providing coverage to the other. Barely had she begun to unzip when a (female) security guard magically materialised – you can’t do that. Use the portaloos, please.</p>
<p>Now we can argue endlessly about the acceptability or otherwise of whipping any species of privates out in a public place, but surely if we’re going basic for the weekend, we should all be as basic as each other? As for the portaloos themselves, well – the feminist implications of in-conveniences for the ladies have <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/11/16/ladies-room/">already been discussed in this very publication</a>, so I won’t repeat them, but I will ask you to consider what happens when those using urinals also share the cubicles with those for whom this is not an option. And the queue-length that implies. All in all, I ended up feeling my experience had been inferior to my male companions’ on account of my sex (and, in the case of the security guard, because of my gender, too). But others have had it worse…</p>
<p>Managing events on this scale, however much it may be a British institution, comes with all kinds of questions around safety, both onstage and off. The dominant concern must always be to make people feel like they’re living dangerously, when in fact they’re safe as the proverbial houses. That’s how you deliver a great live experience. No-one wants to feel on-edge all weekend, but no-one wants to feel mollycoddled either. After all, the teenagers who trash Reading Festival each year are trying to get away from their parents, and it’s surely a given that any festival is riddled with drugs. Who cares?</p>

The resultant spate of thefts was accompanied by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude_Festival#Security_at_Latitude_2010">a gang rape on the first night, and a second instance on the second</a>. On-site, the organisers responded with that old chestnut about women not going around the site unaccompanied. Oh! There’s that gender thing again.</p>
<p>I find this particularly galling because there was a suspected instance of rape in the campsite I was staying in myself on the Saturday night at Bestival. It seemed to be a case of domestic abuse, but it’s the height of irony that a festival attended by 30,000 people could be seen as a ‘safe’ space to take this toxically private crime outside its eponymous home. It’s even more ironic that these crimes against women are occurring at events that are almost synonymous in many minds with the image of one very famous female – Kate Moss, whose ‘festival style’ was <a href="http://uk.news.yahoo.com/moss-tops-festival-style-chart-230320589.html">recently voted the most iconic festival fashion moment of all time</a>, beating Jimi Hendrix’s tasseled white Glastonbury shirt. Rarely was it more truly spoken that one is never so alone as in a large crowd.</p>
<p>The live events sector is a multi-million pound one, and <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/sep/15/uk-festivals-bubble-burst">despite this year’s setbacks</a> (and the state of the economy more generally), it’s still a growth industry long-term. Illegal downloading and the resultant changes to the music industry’s economy will only make live music events of all sizes more important over the coming years. And with <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/the-womens-blog-with-jane-martinson/2011/jun/28/beyonce-headlining-glastonbury-girl-power">Beyonce this year becoming the first female headliner at Glastonbury in 20 years</a> and women like Kate Moss and Sienna Miller leading the style stakes, there’s clearly a female voice coming through. Yet, as unpleasant as it undoubtedly is to admit, when something goes wrong, it’s often the women who suffer – festivals are the perfect rape storm: scantily-clad girls (whose hemlines do not but may be perceived to = consent), large groups of drunk men (our neighbours serenaded us with a beautiful rendition of ‘Get your rat out for the lads’ at four in the afternoon on the Saturday), crowds that can easily separate you from your party, softly-softly security, copious amounts of drugs and large open spaces where people may hear your scream but probably won’t realise, care about, or be in a state to deal with, its urgency. There’s been evidence that <a href="http://www.glastonburylineup.co.uk/php/shewee.php">some live events companies are listening</a>, of course, and I don’t want to suggest a doom-fest of misogyny either – but with the industry set for the boomtimes to come, I’d like to be assured that festivals aren’t a feminist issue.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An FF from our Canadian cousins across the pond. Now, for reasons that escape me, I&#8217;ve long considered Canada to be a bastion of forward thinking and at the forefront of feminist thinking.</p>
<p>So it saddened me a little to find out that victim blaming is as rife on that side of the Atlantic as over here. Fortunately, there&#8217;s also a healthy culture  of individuality and protest. Thus arose today&#8217;s Found Feminism: <a href="http://www.slutwalktoronto.com/">Toronto&#8217;s SlutWalk</a>.</p>
<p>Have a look at the clip below which explains everything (well, not <em>everything</em> everything; the creation of the universe or where the other sock went is not covered):</p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="425" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/3vOCnZOcr8w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>I love inversions and subversions alike, which is why this linguistic reclamation project is placing &#8220;slut&#8221; alongside the word &#8220;queer&#8221; in my heart. Our very own wordsmith <strong>Hodge</strong> is probably <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/category/alphabet/">better placed</a> to go into the history of the word, although my wiki-fu tells me that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slut#Etymology"><strong>Chaucer</strong> used it to apply to lazy men</a> before it became an insult for sexually promiscuous women.</p>
<p>Now whilst I am the first person to get all mumsy and worry over scantily clad people gadding about, I will fight to defend their right to do so without being blamed if they are harrassed or assaulted. Because that is absurd and I&#8217;m not going to go into it here &#8211; let&#8217;s focus on the positive.</p>
<p>And the positive action.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a UK-based sister group planning a SlutWalk in Birmingham (Facebook page is<a href="https://www.facebook.com/slutwalkuk"> here</a>) so sign up, click &#8220;like&#8221; or even get your boob tube out and go for a walk in Brum. I may well see you there!</p>

<p>Thanks to <strong>Brave Sir Robin</strong> for sending this in to us.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a heavily advertised <a href="http://www.lambeth.gov.uk/KnowTheDifference/AboutTheCampaign.htm">rape prevention campaign</a> in the London Borough of Lambeth at the moment which has some very laudable aims, including to challenge the victim blaming culture around rape, recently criticised by Baroness Stern CBE in her report (downloadable <a href="http://www.equalities.gov.uk/stern_review.aspx">here</a>).</p>
<p>The adverts are aimed at young men who socialise in Lambeth, especially Brixton and Clapham, which have recently seen very disturbing rises in rape and sexual violence.</p>
<p>So, is it Found Feminism? I&#8217;m going to give it a two thumbs up for yes, for both reversing gender prejudices and trying a different approach to understanding and dealing with attitudes around rape and rape prevention.</p>
<p>The language and style of both the posters and the website offer a more detailed and mature look at the old &#8220;no means  no&#8221; giving very clear examples of what is and isn&#8217;t legal or acceptable. I&#8217;m particularly interested in this poster because it pushes back the responsibility of gaining consent, and hence on committing the crime, away from what the woman is wearing or what she has had to drink.</p>
<p>Instead, it choses to unpick standard excuses for poor social behaviour:</p>
<blockquote><p>Harmless fun is just that &#8211; harmless fun. Wolf whistling, jeering and making sexually provocative comments can be threatening and make a woman feel at best irritated but also scared and vulnerable. This could be seen as criminal behaviour and you could be arrested and charged. Sexual assault is any unwanted sexual activity.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;d be interested to see whether this style of advert has a wider spread than just one particular borough, and what impact it has on the young men who see the posters.</p>
