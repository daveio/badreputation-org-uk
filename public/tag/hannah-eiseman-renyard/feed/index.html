										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>A little late in being posted, perhaps, but hopefully still of interest! In which three BadReppers &#8211; <strong>Hannah Chutzpah</strong>, <strong>Stephen B</strong> and <strong>Viktoriya</strong> &#8211; chat about their experiences at <strong>Nine Worlds Geekfest</strong> this summer, and more generally about conventions, fandom and feminism.</em></p>
<h2>A more inclusive con?</h2>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/9w.jpeg"><img data-attachment-id="14010" data-permalink="/2013/09/11/what-does-an-inclusive-sci-fi-con-look-like-a-post-nine-worlds-roundtable/9w/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/9w.jpeg?fit=259%2C194&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="259,194" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="9w" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/9w.jpeg?fit=259%2C194&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/9w.jpeg?fit=259%2C194&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/9w-150x150.jpeg?resize=150%2C150" alt="9w" width="150" height="150" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-14010" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><strong>Stephen B:</strong> &#8220;I first noticed how unusually inclusive <a href="https://nineworlds.co.uk/" target="_blank">Nine Worlds</a> was about two minutes after collecting my badge from the front desk. Wandering down the corridor I found myself in&#8230; a <a href="https://nineworlds.co.uk/track/geek-feminism" target="_blank">geek feminism</a> session. </p>
<p>&#8220;I was greeted cheerfully and given a quick intro to what was going on, and then left to join the various groups sitting around the (very popular) room at tables and in small lively seated circles on the floor. The crowd in this room didn’t know my views or that I write for BadRep, and I’m a straight white male &#8211; generally not a famously marginalised group &#8211; but I felt immediately welcome. </p>
<p>&#8220;In the next room along, Bronies were playing guitar and handing out cupcakes. They also had a rave DJ. In that moment, I suspected this wasn’t going to be a typical SF convention.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Safe space?</h2>
<p><strong>Viktoriya:</strong> &#8220;I went to Nine Worlds and I wasn&#8217;t groped, harassed, belittled or condescended to. I felt comfortable enough to walk around dressed in my own clothes, and not necessarily the elaborate armour of ballgowns, cosplay or similar I&#8217;d adopted when frequenting prior conventions. </p>
<p>&#8220;More to the point, I felt comfortable enough to go around ON MY OWN. I can&#8217;t stress this enough. I stopped going to conventions because it had become apparent to me that I was paying a great deal of money to attend an event where it was pretty much guaranteed that I would be assaulted in some way, whereas daily assault is something most women can have for free simply by walking down the street in London. Why pay for the privilege?&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Not being groped, forcibly intoxicated, called a cocktease, an uppity feminist, a silly little girl, or asked to kiss someone for the amusement of male onlookers – it was like a whole new world.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Also, I managed to convince my work friend to come with me to Nine Worlds. You guys, you have no idea of the stress associated with this. </p>
<p>&#8220;What if someone was a dick to her? What if she was assaulted? What if she hated it? Then I would be the work friend who convinced her to spend money on the the thing that was dreadful. </p>
<p>&#8220;So not being groped, forcibly intoxicated, called a cocktease, an uppity feminist, a silly little girl, or asked to kiss someone for the amusement of male onlookers &#8211; it was like a whole new world.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Stephen:</strong> &#8220;It seems that every big convention recently has had a wave of harassment and bad experiences for some attendees. NineWorlds appeared to do things right instead, with a kick-ass <A href= https://nineworlds.co.uk/anti-harassment-policy >anti-harassment policy</a> and some seriously great content.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Running a content track</h2>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/brony-car.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="14006" data-permalink="/2013/09/11/what-does-an-inclusive-sci-fi-con-look-like-a-post-nine-worlds-roundtable/brony-car/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/brony-car.jpg?fit=918%2C1224&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="918,1224" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="brony car" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/brony-car.jpg?fit=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/brony-car.jpg?fit=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/brony-car-225x300.jpg?resize=225%2C300" alt="brony car" width="225" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-14006" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/brony-car.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/brony-car.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/brony-car.jpg?w=918&amp;ssl=1 918w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><strong>Hannah Chutzpah:</strong> &#8220;It was an honour and a privilege to be asked to run the <a href="https://nineworlds.co.uk/track/creative-writing" target="_blank">creative writing track</a>. I spent pretty much the whole run-up panicking and convinced my everything would be a huge disaster&#8230;. right up until the second session where my longtime frenemy &#8211; author <a href="https://nineworlds.co.uk/guest/hannah-eiseman-renyard" target="_blank"><strong>Chris Farnell</strong></a> &#8211; gave a talk on &#8216;<a href="https://nineworlds.co.uk/track/news/2013/08/02/working-time-machine-writing-time-travel-so-it-makes-sense" target="_blank">Working the Time Machine: writing time travel so it makes sense&#8217;</a>. </p>
<p>&#8220;We had a packed out room, with people hanging out the doors. Then, as the crowds left and I patted Chris and myself on the back, starting to believe this whole thing might work &#8211; this toy car, sent by the Bronies (pictured) whirred through the door full of cupcakes.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Fandom and atmosphere</h2>
<p><strong>Stephen: </strong>&#8220;Nine Worlds is set up to include a wide range of fandoms and geekery, and all the different fans are welcome in the same space. There was <em>so much</em> going on, I barely saw the other Team BadRep folks.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t just &#8216;here&#8217;s the gay corner&#8217;, so it felt much more open to (say) the B and the T and the Q of &#8216;LGBTQ*&#8217;. Which &#8211; as a bi girl &#8211; I found very, very refreshing.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Hannah:</strong> &#8220;I didn&#8217;t get out to as much of the rest of the fest as you two, but the main thing which spilled across every room, hallway, lobby, breakfast bar and so on was the extremely friendly and welcoming nature of the whole conference. </p>
<p>&#8220;The only other geek con I&#8217;ve been to was the SFX weekender, which wasn&#8217;t <em>unfriendly </em>, but I also can&#8217;t remember half as much mingling (or half as many reasons to mingle) as there were here.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Stephen:</strong> &#8220;I’m not a convention-goer. The friendly atmosphere and lack of judging at Nine Worlds was the kind of pleasant, safe space I’d assume any good con would try for, but from everything I’ve heard in recent years this one got it unusually right. </p>
<p>&#8220;I saw tweets from people saying that having dedicated LGBTQ* content made such a difference to their time there. Even the Bronies didn’t seem to get the usual derision, mostly because they were just unrelentingly happy and frequently gave you cake.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Faves?</h2>
<p><strong>Hannah:</strong> The two standout workshops for me, personally, were fantasy novelist <a href="http://tompollock.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Tom Pollock&#8217;s</strong></a> creative writing workshop on Making Monsters &#8211; which generated at least one idea I&#8217;m going to be writing into a short story. </p>
<p>&#8220;Also, <a href="http://www.enewman.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>Emma Newman</strong></a> ran a workshop on &#8216;Fear and Writing&#8217; &#8211; drawing on <a href="http://www.enewman.co.uk/writing/the-writers-rutter/when-just-write-is-not-enough" target="_blank">her own experiences as an author</a>. </p>
<p>&#8220;Two takeaway things for me were her describing procrastination as a fear-based behaviour, and<br />
that perfectionism is fear&#8217;s favourite coat. Emma &#8211; thank you. That stuff really spoke to me. Like, more than my shrink does.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Hannah:</strong> &#8220;And since it wasn&#8217;t &#8216;here&#8217;s the gay corner&#8217; it felt much more open to (say) the B and the T and the Q sections. Which &#8211; as a bi girl &#8211; I found very, very refreshing.&#8221; </p>
<p><strong>Stephen:</strong> &#8220;On the Friday night I went to a swordfighting workshop with Miltos Yerolemou, the actor who played Syrio Forel in <strong>Game of Thrones</strong>. </p>
<p>&#8220;It was a <em>lot</em> of fun, and at least two thirds of the attendees were women (one of whom was you, Viktoriya, and I totally clocked your expression of demonic glee when you got to swing a very large wooden sword, which suggested you enjoyed the session!).&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Viktoriya:</strong> &#8220;I loved that there was a knitting track, and a <strong>My Little Pony</strong> track, and a board games track. It stressed the diversity of interests that are brought together under the fandom and geek umbrellas in a way that cannot be present in any single-show or single-theme convention. </p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that the &#8216;celebrity guests&#8217; were actually there for panels, activities and workshops primarily, with singing autographs very much a secondary activity, was even better. I despair of the autograph factories modern conventions have become. Queueing for eight hours is not my idea of fun.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Could-do-betters?</h2>
<p><strong>Viktoriya:</strong> &#8220;Well, OK, let me argue with myself for a little bit. I&#8217;m going to nitpick here, not out of anger but because the organisers have shown a genuine interest in learning from their mistakes and in improving the experience in coming years.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, accessibility. I don&#8217;t know what the experience was for those attendees with limited mobility, but I am relatively able-bodied and even I found it a bit cumbersome navigating the stairs in two hotels with only the few lifts. </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Ultimately, that’s what I’m looking for in a convention: committing to doing better next time when mistakes are made.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Some of the multimedia was a little difficult to engage with without risking pain &#8211; strobe lighting, very loud soundscape, and so on. </p>
<p>&#8220;Bringing in a general warning system (a sign on the door?) of strobe lighting for those affected by it, and doing a soundcheck before launching the sound and leaving it at whatever level, would be good.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Stephen:</strong> &#8220;I went to the board games hotel only briefly, and there were lots of steep stairs, but then that&#8217;s the one used for loads of much bigger cons, so I&#8217;m sure they must have a solution in place?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Viktoriya:</strong> &#8220;Well, big cons tend to have a like it or lump it policy. They have priority queuing for fans with mobility issues, but that&#8217;s about it as far as I&#8217;m aware. Individual cons may have a better provision, but I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then there&#8217;s the issue of diversity in organisers and session leads. Part of this is maybe due to the fact that it was the first Nine Worlds, but the organisers, session leads and attendees were overwhelmingly white. </p>
<p>&#8220;Take the panel on <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2013/nineworlds/scmcwd/" target="_blank">Problematic Issues</a> &#8211; some odd things were said during this sessions, and it was also an entirely white panel (so discussing representations of race was rather awkward). I think it was trying to cover too many fandom issues: racism in fanfic and fandom, fetishing gay sex, writing male characters and ignoring female ones, reaffirming heteronormative norms, etc. In an hour.</p>
<p>&#8220;Contrast this with the <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2013/nineworlds/scmdgy/ " target="_blank">Racefail 101 panel</a> in the Books track, which brought together awesome writers of colour to focus on writing characters of colour, and seeking out writers of colour.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given the number of tracks and the number of organisers required, I&#8217;d suggest that the lead organisers work on diversifying the track leads.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;With accessibility, big cons tend to have a like-it-or-lump-it policy. They have priority queuing for fans with mobility issues, but often that’s about it.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p> &#8220;Finally, I disagree with Steve on the inclusiveness extended to the Bronies, mostly because in the sessions I was present at, they were frequently the butt of the joke. </p>
<p>&#8220;Fundamentally, I think it&#8217;s uncool to include something as a track (and therefore give implicit approval of its existence) and then spend the weekend being a bit weirded out by it. I don&#8217;t claim to be part of the MLP fandom, but I thought it was a bit harsh.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Stephen:</strong> &#8220;I didn&#8217;t see the panels where Bronies were mocked, but I did see a lot of people commenting out loud that this was their first experience of them and they thought Bronies were awesome.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Viktoriya:</strong> &#8220;I wonder if part of it isn&#8217;t a reflexive &#8216;let&#8217;s build a hierarchy&#8217; instinct. Certainly there was that feeling at times at the fanfic panels, and some of the comments re: board gaming from attendees. The Bronies were the only ones where I heard panellists commenting on it, though, and there is <a href="http://mechanicalhamster.wordpress.com/2013/08/12/a-great-geekend-part-1-friday/#more-906" target="_blank">some evidence that attendees felt a bit singled out</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What I do think is great is that the organisers of the Problematic Issues panel realised what had gone wrong, and have <a href="http://ladymoonray.livejournal.com/875717.html" target="_blank">publically acknowledged it</a> and committed to doing better next time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ultimately, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m looking for in a convention. There were a few tweeted mentions of positive and negative feedback (which, to their credit, the Nine Worlds twitter feed retweeted).&#8221;</p>
<h2>Let&#8217;s wrap this up&#8230;</h2>
<p><strong>Hannah:</strong> &#8220;I think everyone involved understands it was a first attempt at a huge thing and the learning curve was, and will continue to be, pretty damn steep – but I couldn’t be prouder to be a part of it or more excited about next year.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Viktoriya:</strong> &#8220;Since there&#8217;s a year until the next Nine Worlds I guess I&#8217;ll conclude with some general links on the inclusion and harassment issues &#8211; if you&#8217;re thinking of going to a convention and are concerned about safety, or if you have been harassed at a convention and want to know how to report it, have a look at these resources:</p>
<ul>
<li>Elise Mathesen&#8217;s experience of reporting sexual harassment <a href="http://seanan-mcguire.livejournal.com/517984.html" target="_blank">here</a>, including a contact and resource list for reporting it <a href="http://www.jimchines.com/2013/07/reporting-sexual-harassment-2013/" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
<li>Carrie Cuinn&#8217;s experiences and guide for reporting are <a href="http://carriecuinn.com/2013/06/30/please-stop-touching-my-breasts-and-other-things-i-say-at-cons/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://carriecuinn.com/2013/07/02/sexual-harassment-at-cons-part-2-how-to-stop-it-and-other-thoughts/" target="_blank">here</a> </li>
<li>Finally, the odious Ted Beale was recently finally expelled from <a href="http://www.locusmag.com/News/2013/08/beale-expelled-from-sfwa/" target="_blank">SFWA</a>. NK Jemisin has written <a href="http://nkjemisin.com/2013/08/time-to-pick-a-side/" target="_blank">a blisteringy on-point post</a> on racism and misogyny in SFF, Beale&#8217;s expulsion, and the behaviour which led to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;Most of all, I loved the fact that I enjoyed Nine Worlds so much, I have already decided I&#8217;m going next year. No uncertainty, no hmm-maybe and oh-yes-perhaps. I&#8217;m going next year because it was wonderful. How can you argue with that?&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This post is part of a series on the theme of women and protest. The full series is collected <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/tag/revolting-women/">under the tag &#8220;Revolting Women&#8221;</a>. Welcome back to <a href="http://hannahdoublebarrel.wordpress.com/">Hannah Eiseman-Renyard</a>&#8230; </em></p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenham_Common_Women's_Peace_Camp"><strong>Greenham Common</strong></a> was, by all accounts, something epic: a peaceful campaign of sustained, cooperative occupation by women against the bomb – and it <em>worked</em>. From 1981 to 2000 the camp, based around RAF Greenham Common military base in Berkshire, protested the presence of the (American) nuclear weapons held there – and eventually the weapons were removed.</p>

How awesomecool is my momma? </p>
<p>Greenham Common had been an RAF base since 1941, and an American airbase since 1968. When the US moved 96 cruise missiles there in 1980, the protest began – forming properly in 1981. For years women, and their children too, lived in a makeshift camp in all weathers. Much like the <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/09/07/revolting-women-the-fight-for-the-missing-and-the-mothers-of-the-plaza-de-mayo/">Mothers of the Disappeared</a> protest in South America, Greenham Common used the concept of maternal authority to lend weight to their campaign. The women of Greenham Common were not protesting just for themselves, but for everyone – for their children’s future, and for everyone else’s. They hammered this home with slogans like ‘when I grow up I want to be alive’ – and children’s clothes and children’s art were often part of the decorations tied along the fences.</p>
<p>Some children lived in the camp, too. I’m afraid this is where my statistics gets a bit fuzzy because over 19 years, and through different seasons, it probably changed more than a bit.</p>
<p>My mother reports the place was often a carnival: </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;there were the usual collections of street performers and puppet shows to cheer us on&#8230; people on decorated bikes, that kind of thing &#8230; there was a lot of weaving things in the perimeter fence – rainbows, kid art, &#8230; the whole perimeter fence was very gorgeous. There were a lot of spiderwebs in the art. Spiderwebs were a big theme &#8211; I suppose the theme of weaving something, surrounding something.</p></blockquote>
<p>Punks, too. Or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachne">Arachnes</a>. Either way, I approve. </p>
<p>The women who lived there endured arrests, freezing and muddy conditions and the most rudimentary of provisions. Make no mistake – these were badass women. Muddy women, tired women, cold women, but strong, capable, mind-blowingly determined women, and women who were not afraid to use bolt cutters.</p>

The protest was closely allied with CND, and it garnered respect and support from people of all walks of life. This <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/video/2007/dec/12/greenham"><strong>Guardian</strong> video</a> shows the mix and gives slightly more of an idea of what the protests were like than my second-generation verbal squeezing can do.  </p>
<p>Over the ten main years of the protest many people came and went, but the backbone of it all were the base camps. There were nine of these, each based around a different set of gates to the base. Each base gained its own flavour and focus, with the Violet Gate formed of religious groups, the Blue Gate being much more new age, and the Green Gate being entirely women-only as a rule. </p>
<p>Personally I’m dubious about sticking a gender divide in an otherwise very uniting protest – but there were many places where men were welcome, too, and this simply was, from the start, a women’s movement. It was founded and organised by women’s groups (which in the 80s especially were fucking rad) – and women’s groups and unions around the country organised coaches to and from the big demos. </p>
<p>The campaign gained huge amounts of media attention in 1983 when around 70,000 protestors <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/player/nol/newsid_6540000/newsid_6548500/6548577.stm?bw=bb&#038;mp=rm&#038;news=1&#038;ms3=4&#038;ms_javascript=true&#038;bbcws=2">formed a human chain around the base</a>, stopping movement in and out of it. (My mom was there!) With around 100 women being arrested for breaking in. (My mom didn’t do that bit.) The scale and success of the Greenham Common protest was widely credited with prompting similar actions elsewhere in Britain and Europe. </p>
<p>The base camp protestors were evicted on numerous occasions, but always returned before nightfall to set up camp again. </p>
<p>So – how did it all come to a close? In 1991 the weapons were removed – but many protestors stayed a further nine badass years until the final perimeter fences were removed and the Common was returned back to public land. Partly this was to make sure the land was returned, but partly, it seems, because a real community had formed and people were reluctant to leave it. </p>
<p>Above and beyond the call of duty – with rainbows and mud and sisterhood. I think I’m in love. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[Q: How many feminists does it take to change a light bulb?
A: THAT'S NOT FUNNY!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Please welcome the glorious <strong>Hannah Eiseman-Renyard</strong> to the guestpost soapbox&#8230; </em></p>
<blockquote><p>Q: How many feminists does it take to change a light bulb?</p>
<p>A: THAT&#8217;S NOT FUNNY!</p></blockquote>
<p>I love live comedy, honest I do. I spent two weeks at the <strong>Edinburgh Fringe Festival</strong> last year and I&#8217;ll be there for the full three weeks this year. Some of my best friends are (very good) comedians. However, as a scene: live comedy has a problem. I haven&#8217;t been an aficionado for many years, so maybe it was always there &#8211; but if <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2010/sep/10/rape-jokes-in-comedy">recent articles</a> are anything to go by; it seems to be growing. Increasingly, the search for &#8216;edgy&#8217; material is translating into a scene where the recoil laugh &#8211; the <em>I-can&#8217;t-believe-you-just-said-that </em>laugh &#8211; is the only one aimed for. The targets are &#8216;soft&#8217; &#8211; minorities and marginalized groups &#8211; and the jokes prod at the same old prejudices. The numbers of times I come home from a comedy gig wanting to dry-clean my brain is rising.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/teeth.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="5034" data-permalink="/2011/04/21/a-lower-low/teeth/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/teeth.jpg?fit=500%2C334&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="500,334" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="teeth" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/teeth.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/teeth.jpg?fit=500%2C334&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/teeth-300x200.jpg?resize=300%2C200" alt="Photo showing a red and white plastic windup 'chattering teeth' toy.

A sketch group of white, able-bodied young men performed a series of female grotesques which were so consistently unpleasant that &#8211; though cheerily presented &#8211; the unmistakable undercurrent to the evening was &#8216;we really don&#8217;t like women much.&#8217; Most sketches involved a member of the group donning a plastic wig to &#8216;be a girl&#8217; &#8211; and every female character was a Lolita, a whore, a woman giving birth or a mother who hated her children. The punchlines ranged from coat hanger abortions to incest to rape to paedophilia. At my table, from about halfway through, we didn&#8217;t laugh so much as look to each other for reaction shots and a reality check. This troupe&#8217;s final skit was a song and dance number, the &#8216;Cell Block Tango&#8217; from <strong>Chicago</strong>, with the <a href="http://www.allmusicals.com/lyrics/chicago/cellblocktango.htm">words</a> changed to &#8216;<em>she</em> had it coming&#8217;. Had there not been other people on the bill who I really wanted to see, I would have walked out then and there.</p>
<p>The problem is more widespread than just <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/theatreblog/2010/aug/18/edinburgh-comedy-porn-gimp-fight">one shit comedy troupe </a>. People more eloquent than myself have pointed out this <a href="http://chris-coltrane.livejournal.com/405924.html">return to the bad old days</a>. It seems like the decades of hard-earned progress, a basic standard of &#8216;don&#8217;t be a shit to the marginalised&#8217;, is being discarded because now it&#8217;s apparently ironic. Sexism is increasingly tolerated (after all, everything&#8217;s sorted and equal now, so just lighten up, bitch) and other kinds of prejudice are also creeping back, too. &#8216;It&#8217;s not racist, it&#8217;s just un-PC, and no one likes political correctness. So, while we&#8217;re at it, what about those immigrants, homos, and the disabled, aye?&#8217;</p>
<p>Increasingly comedians who get pulled up for saying genuinely unpleasant things (I&#8217;m looking at you, <a href="http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2010/12/09/12343/jordans_fury_over_frankie_boyle_gag_"><strong>Frankie Boyle</strong></a>) have taken this to be their selling point and then upped the ante in general douchery. While Jordan, the gossip-magazines&#8217; favourite glamour model, might seem a fair target, when exactly did her disabled son become fair game, too? Let alone in a joke about incest and rape. I&#8217;ll repeat that: an incest-rape joke about a disabled eight-year-old child. </p>
<p>While I&#8217;m sure there has always been some truly unpleasant comedy around, its apparent mainstream acceptance is a new trend. The Frankie Boyle joke aired on Channel 4. This worries me because our words do carry a power &#8211; they reflect how we see the world, but they also set our standards for what is normal, acceptable, okay. The trickle-down effect has real-world consequences. The <a href="http://fugitivus.wordpress.com/2009/06/24/a-woman-walks-into-a-rape-uh-bar/">rise of the rape joke</a> can be a horrific trigger for those who have experienced it. In increments, these themes &#8211; packaged as entertainment &#8211; normalise these horrors and dismiss their seriousness.  </p>
<p>This is not an argument for censorship &#8211; I had fervent arguments a few years ago with Daily Fail-reading colleagues about whether <strong>Jerry Springer: The Opera</strong> should be shown on TV (yes, yes, a thousand times yes!) &#8211; but there is a huge middle ground between Mary Whitehouse prudery and comedy which is getting pretty close to hatespeech. Please, guys: self-regulate a little by engaging the brain.</p>
<p>Some would argue that if I don&#8217;t like this brand of comedy, I just shouldn&#8217;t watch it. To some extent they&#8217;re right, and I do try. When I saw a poster in Edinburgh for a standup show called &#8216;The Lying Bitch and the Wardrobe&#8217; (I see what you did there) I had a pretty strong inkling that this wouldn&#8217;t be my kind of thing and I didn&#8217;t go. But on a mixed bill (as almost all small live comedy gigs are) there&#8217;s rarely any warning what each person will do &#8211; so while you might have gone along because you recognise one name that you like, there is no disclosure until you&#8217;re hearing it that the third act, Joe Bloggs, will be your prejudiced asshat for the evening, berating you all with a microphone for at least ten minutes.</p>
<p>Oh, and you paid to see this.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think anything should be off-limits &#8211; but some topics are so unpleasant (not to mention increasingly over-mined) that if a comedian wants to tackle them they will need to be so damn funny, so ingenious, original, tactful &#8211; that 80% of comedians just shouldn&#8217;t bother. Needless to say, the 80% that aren&#8217;t up to speed don&#8217;t get this, and the 20% that can do it well often have better things to do than prod triggertastic subjects and tired old clichés with a great big stick. They&#8217;re off crafting material that makes you belly-laugh (and think) rather than just titter nervously in disbelief.</p>

<p>I think the thing which is missing (besides originality) is a measure of basic empathy. In the increasingly desperate search for &#8216;dark&#8217; and &#8216;cutting edge&#8217; material, comedians forget that a lot of their lazily-picked targets are people. Real people. People with feelings and also (self-interest alert, guys:) <em>people who go to comedy gigs.</em></p>
<p>The rising amount of &#8216;ironic&#8217; misogyny is not creating a particularly friendly environment for a certain 50% of punters. Last year I went to the <strong>Comedy Store</strong> to see twelve different comedians being filmed for <a href="http://www.theworldstandsup.com"><strong>The World Stands Up</strong></a>. I wasn&#8217;t entirely sure if the person who&#8217;d invited me along had intended the evening as a date or not, so it was potentially awkward already. Then, as the evening unfolded, four out of twelve comedians used &#8216;bad fellatio&#8217; as the bedrock of their sets. One standup spent his whole set mocking his wife for not pleasuring him correctly. In the narratives that we heard that night, women&#8217;s main role was as dispensers of sexual favours &#8211; and we couldn&#8217;t even do that right. Thanks, guys. I haven&#8217;t been back to the Comedy Store since.</p>
<p>For another example, I was once out with a group for a friend&#8217;s birthday when a standup did a set about making a mess in the disabled toilet and blaming it on a disabled person. While he wasn&#8217;t to know that birthday girl, sat in the front row, had cerebral palsy, why did he think this would be a good topic in the first place? How many times has he encouraged the able-bodied to laugh at this disadvantaged minority&#8217;s expense?</p>

Catherine Semark performing at Edinburgh Fringe. Photo by me. </p></div>One piece of etiquette that people seem to be riding roughshod over is whether you have a &#8216;claim&#8217; to your material. While there aren&#8217;t any rules about who is allowed to talk about what, whether or not you&#8217;re on the receiving end of a prejudice can make a huge difference to whether or not you have the empathy, warmth, and originality to do it well.  <strong>Richard Pryor</strong>, <strong>Omid Djalili</strong>, <strong>Sarah Silverman</strong>, or <strong>Goodness Gracious Me</strong> on race: usually very good. <strong>Jim Davidson</strong> on race: enough said.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t an argument for &#8216;nice&#8217; comedy. Some of my favourite comedians are pretty darn dark and twisted &#8211; <strong>Bill Hicks</strong>, <strong>Dylan Moran</strong>, and I heartily recommend London sketch group <a href="http://www.thebetamales.com"><strong>The Beta Males</strong></a>  &#8211; but the &#8216;type&#8217; of twisted is crucial.  Jokes are about status &#8211; people use them every day to agree boundaries of what&#8217;s acceptable, and with that comes a certain amount of responsibility. When activist comedians such as <strong>Mark Thomas</strong> or <strong>Kate Smurthwaite</strong> use humour to mock people in power for making bad decisions, that&#8217;s something very different to a middle class standup laying into &#8216;chavs&#8217; for &#8216;talking funny and drinking cheap booze&#8217;.</p>
<p>Anger and humour are very often interlinked, but <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2011/feb/05/top-gear-offensive-steve-coogan ">where you aim that anger makes all the difference</a>. Aim it &#8216;up&#8217; at deserving, more powerful targets and it&#8217;s subversive, it can hold people to account &#8211; satire has a long and proud tradition. Aim that anger &#8216;down&#8217; at the underdog and it&#8217;s tired, old and &#8211; frankly &#8211; it&#8217;s bullying.  </p>
