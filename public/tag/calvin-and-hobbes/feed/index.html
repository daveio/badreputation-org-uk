<p>Now, as the opening music rose I&#8217;m sure you cringed as much as I did. But when our enterprising lemonade maker launched into a different language, did you smile instead? There&#8217;s a tendency to ignore or overlook the marketing campaigns of big business and to assume that nothing they ever do can possibly be for the good. After all, they&#8217;re trying to sell us products and services, right? But marketing tries to make us empathise, and to capture our hopes, dreams and ideas for the future. It also guns for mass market appeal.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s the idea: a clever little girl can grow up to be a multinational business leader.</p>
<p>The lemonade stand metaphor is an interesting one, and certainly well used in the fields of business and commerce. It&#8217;s used as the basis of training games for pricing models, economics theory (there&#8217;s a nice <a href="http://pecuniarities.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/calvineconomics.jpg">Calvin and Hobbes one here)</a>, maths tutorials and host of other skills needed to run your own business. It&#8217;s not just a cute thing that kids do; it&#8217;s also about how we introduce children, boys and girls, to the world of work.</p>
<p>The models we use for &#8220;work&#8221; within childhood play set the tone for how we expect children to behave and the roles they might grow into. I remember books on work with pictures of male pilots and female air hostesses. Mothers cleaning the house whilst fathers returned from work.  Some of these have since been pleasingly updated, including the <a href="http://goodmenproject.com/good-feed-blog/social-change-gender-roles-and-richard-scarrys-best-word-book-ever/">Richard Scarry books</a>.</p>
<p>I was told by a friend of mine (who was a boy) that he couldn&#8217;t play with pots and pans because they were &#8220;for girls&#8221;.  We must have been about six. Even though we were actually a rock band. With wooden spoons instead of drumsticks. Maybe we were a girl band.</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>I like the fact that this campaign could have just as easily been done with a young boy and his mother, but instead we have a girl and her dad. A decisive, smart and multi-lingual little girl. Her loving and supportive father, blown away by his daughter&#8217;s abilities.</p>
<p>Future businesswoman of the year, perhaps?</p>
