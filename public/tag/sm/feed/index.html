					<description><![CDATA[Another week, another women-in-music controversy, and another hotly debated video from Rihanna.  I'm just glad debate is happening and that we have a mainstream artist who doesn't shy away from instigating it.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Another week, another women-in-music controversy, and another hotly debated video from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rihanna"><strong>Rihanna</strong></a>. Having ticked  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uelHwf8o7_U">domestic violence</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/verify_age?next_url=http%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DKdS6HFQ_LUc">sadomasochism </a>off the musical list, she’s responded to recent  <a href="http://www.wingfantasy.com/rihanna-christina-aguilera-face-criticism-outrageous-outfits-xfactor/">accusations </a> of being a major player in the oversexualisation of pop by upping the ante, making her latest offering a blend of sexual violence and violent retribution. The video for <strong>Man Down</strong>, which opens with Rihanna shooting a man who is later revealed to have assaulted her after they dance at a club, has kicked up a <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/157962/20110606/rihanna-man-down-parents-television-council-ptc-chris-brwon-sexual-assault-rape-victim-feminism-bet.htm">predictable </a> <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1665121/rihanna-man-down-controversy.jhtml">media </a> <a href="http://www.bet.com/shows/106-and-park/news/rihanna-man-down.html">dustcloud</a>. It&#8217;s all a far cry from<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEauWw9ZGrA"> &#8216;Pon de Replay&#8217;</a>.</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/sEhy-RXkNo0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Amid <a href="http://www.metro.co.uk/music/865073-rihannas-man-down-video-should-be-banned-say-us-pressure-groups">calls</a> for the video to be banned, it&#8217;s interesting to see how much of the outrage centres on the murder, rather than the rape. Granted, the shooting and its aftermath is shown far more explicitly than the hinted-at assault, but commentary such as that of media watchdog Paul Porter:</p>
<blockquote><p>“‘Man Down’ is an inexcusable, shock-only, shoot-and-kill theme song. In my 30 years of viewing BET, I have never witnessed such a cold, calculated execution of murder in primetime&#8230;&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>appears to be divorcing the shooting from its context, concentrating on Rihanna as the agent and perpetrator of a crime, rather than as the victim of one. This wilfully ignores one of the video&#8217;s central messages, which is the ease with which these roles can be merged.</p>
<p>Sex and violence, and sexual violence, as themes in art and entertainment are as old as art and entertainment themselves. To be flippant for a second: maybe it&#8217;s just the use of the word ‘Mama’, but the chorus of &#8216;Man Down&#8217; put me in mind of that certain section of <a href="http://youtu.be/irp8CNj9qBI"><strong>Bohemian Rhapsody</strong></a> where the narrator, having just killed a man, ruminates on how &#8216;life had just begun and now I&#8217;ve gone and thrown it all away&#8217;. And while I don’t think Freddie Mercury was ever actively described as a positive role model, neither was he castigated for encouraging cold-blooded cod-operatic executions among 1970s youth.</p>
<p>Is Rihanna coming in for particular criticism because of the publicity previously given to her real-life encounters with violence? Those of you following along at home will of course have noticed that she didn’t respond to her experience of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/nov/04/rihanna-chris-brown">assault</a> by shooting Chris Brown on the concourse of Grand Central Station. Surely no one seriously believes ‘Man Down’ to be advocating that the victims of violence engage in violent reprisals &#8211; any more than that was true of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103074/"><strong>Thelma &#038; Louise</strong></a>, or  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067800/"><strong>Straw Dogs</strong></a>, or, to really stretch the analogy, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_and_the_Maiden_(play)"><strong>Death and the Maiden</strong></a>? &#8216;Man Down&#8217; is, on one level, a revenge fantasy which relies on the dramatic and the sensational to get its message across.</p>
<p>Roger Ebert <a href="http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20030314/REVIEWS/303140303/1023">wrote of <strong>Irréversible</strong></a>, whose backwards chronology ‘Man Down’ recalls, that the film&#8217;s structure makes it inherently moral &#8211; that by presenting the vengeance before the acts that inspire it, we are forced to process the vengeance first, and therefore think more deeply about its implications. Might the same apply to ‘Man Down’? Throughout the lyrics and video, the song&#8217;s protagonist may contextualise and explain her actions, but she&#8217;s not free of regret, she isn&#8217;t gleeful or exultant, and she acknowledges her actions as a crime with implications for the rest of her life. She calls herself a ‘criminal’ and reflects that her rapist and victim was ‘somebody’s son’. The narrative doesn&#8217;t glorify murder, but it recognises that we live in a world where this kind of fantasy-vigilante approach might often seem more accessible and plausible than relying for justice on the state or the police.</p>
<p>Art and entertainment don&#8217;t exist in a vacuum. Art will be asked to justify itself, particularly when it touches on themes that are an everyday reality for many of us and which feed into issues like the space which women, particularly women of colour, have to express themselves, and the perpetuation of negative stereotypes versus the impetus, the desire, and perhaps the moral duty, to openly discuss the conditions under which we live.</p>
<p>The complex intersections of race and gender hardly lend themselves to being cleared up in the confines of a blog post, but ‘Man Down’ has sparked plenty of engaged and informative discussion online – at <a href="http://crunkfeministcollective.wordpress.com/2011/06/02/man-down-on-rihanna-rape-and-violence/">Crunk Feminist</a>, <a href="http://thebeautifulstruggler.com/2011/06/rihannas-man-down-sparks-absurd-controversy/">The Beautiful Struggler</a>, and <a href="http://hellobeautiful.com/hellobeautiful-original/arielcrockett/rihanna-man-down-video-double-standard/">Hello Beautiful </a> for starters. I&#8217;m just glad debate is happening and that we have a mainstream artist who doesn&#8217;t shy away from instigating it.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A mere three years after she started out, and after just seventeen weeks of her second album at Number One, it appears to have suddenly dawned on Richard Russell that Adele exemplifies all that’s healthy and hopeful in the otherwise dire and overheated state of contemporary pop.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Poor old millionaire superstar <strong>Adele</strong>, eh? No sooner has the dust settled on the furore over her <a href="http://politicalscrapbook.net/2011/05/adele-tax-brit-school/">objections</a> to being a higher-rate taxpayer, than she gets thrown into the vanguard of another of those putative Real Women in Music revolutions. A mere three years after she started out, and after just seventeen weeks of her second album at Number One, it appears to have suddenly dawned on Richard Russell that Adele exemplifies <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/may/29/adele-change-women-music-business">all that’s healthy and hopeful</a> in the otherwise dire and overheated state of contemporary pop.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The whole message with [Adele] is that it&#8217;s just music, it&#8217;s just really good music,&#8221; said Russell. &#8220;There is nothing else. There are no gimmicks, no selling of sexuality. I think in the American market, particularly, they have come to the conclusion that is what you have to do.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

Even leaving aside such vested interests, his argument that she represents some kind of paradigm shift has been ably deconstructed <a href="http://www.laurasnapes.co.uk/on-why-adele-isnt-quite-the-groundbreaking-paradigm-richard-russell-thinks-she-is/">here</a> by Laura Snapes.</p>
<p>The <strong>Guardian </strong>article linked to above has a few frustrating facets of its own. I’m not sure why Rihanna’s &#8216;S&amp;M&#8217; should be hoicked in to illustrate Russell’s point: there’s a difference between having a sexualised image – usually, when it&#8217;s the subject of criticism, one that’s been externally imposed on an artist – and singing about sex and sexuality. Especially when &#8216;S&amp;M&#8217; is a more complex song than that framework allows for &#8211; arguably one in which Rihanna presents non-mainstream sexuality in terms of female agency. Finally, the idea of good-girl, sexless Adele vs bad-girl, sexualised Rihanna is a false dichotomy with problems in abundance.</p>
<p>Adele’s own image is hardly free of contrivance, harking back as it does to the blue-eyed soul divas of the 1960s &#8211; classily sexualised, perhaps, but sexualised nonetheless. In her chosen brand of popular music, a degree of sex in your self-presentation is, as Russell correctly identifies, inextricably linked to commercial success. It’s even arguable, unfortunately, that it’s Adele’s very distance from the currently acceptable aesthetic norms of her genre that has necessitated she be marketed with a different, &#8216;desexualised&#8217; focus. Had Adele possessed her own voice but the body of, oh, let&#8217;s say Katy Perry, would her image have been sexed-up business as usual?</p>
<p>Russell is taking issue, of course, not with the marketing and self-presentation of all women in music, but with a particular branch of commercial pop, and the marketing therein of female artists by predominantly male management, which was ever thus. If his comments do kickstart a new way of measuring the money-making potential of women in music, then great, but it&#8217;s going to be an uphill struggle in view of the constant and increasing pressures on female performers &#8211; as well as male &#8211; to conform to a blandly beautiful industry standard.</p>
<p>Is Adele&#8217;s refusal to bow to that standard, as Russell claims, as radical today as the Prodigy were in the early 1990s? Let’s face it, mainstream acts are so limp and colourless right now, and popular culture so devoid of ideas, experiments and imagination, that yeah, it probably is. Never mind that the Prodigy were highly politicised and engaged with a wider oppositional culture, while Adele is outspoken in bemoaning her tax burden.</p>
<p>While no one can begrudge Adele her success, or deny that it&#8217;s refreshing to witness, the fact that she can be said to occupy a radical position is more an indictment of contemporary music than it is a compliment to her. The most positive thing about Russell&#8217;s remarks is the opportunity they offer to reiterate a greater truth: that commercial profit-driven pap purely designed to generate a profit is more than socio-culturally damaging for women, it’s dull.</p>
