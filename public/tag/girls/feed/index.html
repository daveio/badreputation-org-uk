					<description><![CDATA[The more children's books I read and the more princesses I come to know, the more I realise that 'kickass' probably wasn't the best term to use.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>When I think about everything about womanhood that hamstrung me with fear when I was thirteen it all came down, really, to princesses. I didn’t think I had to work hard to be a woman (which is scary but obviously eventually achievable). I thought I had to somehow magically &#8211; through superhuman psychic effort &#8211; transform into a princess instead. That’s how I’d get fallen in love with. That’s how I’d get along. That’s how the world would welcome me.</p>
<p>&#8211; Caitlin Moran, <strong>How to be a Woman</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Welcome to part two of Kickass Princesses – a look at some subversive female protagonists in children&#8217;s literature. <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/03/28/kickass-princesses-part-1/">You can read Part 1 here.</a></p>
<p>The more children&#8217;s books I read and the more princesses I come to know, the more I realise that &#8216;kickass&#8217; probably wasn&#8217;t the best term to use. Some of these characters do kick ass, but the main feature is turning out to be simply that they make unconventional princesses.</p>
<p>As the archetype of a fairytale princess is so ingrained, it takes looking at a wide variety of &#8216;unprincessy&#8217; examples to unpick exactly what some of our starting assumptions are. A closer look at the &#8216;unconventional&#8217; princesses here, and in my previous post, reveals that these women and girls have agency, interests, and are more than just a beautiful, delicate, unsullied physical appearance. Sometimes they aren&#8217;t even beautiful at all. What they are – what, we realise, makes them &#8216;unprincessy&#8217; – is often simply the fact that they are two-dimensional characters.</p>
<p>Ouch. This stereotype needs subverting roughly forever ago. On with the show&#8230;</p>
<h3>The Ordinary Princess</h3>

<ul>
<li><em>Written and illustrated by MM Kaye, published in 1980 by Doubleday</em></li>
</ul>
<p>At 107 pages, this one&#8217;s aimed at a slightly older age group than the rest of the books in this post, which are all picture books.</p>
<p>The plot begins when the seventh princess is born in the land of Phantasmorania, and even the fairies are invited to the Christening, despite the King&#8217;s reservations. The bad-tempered and seaweedy fairy Crustacea, pissed off by the bad journey in to the palace, gives the baby the gift of ordinariness. Instantly the baby cries for the first time, and becomes considerably less attractive. As she grows up, our girl Amethyst (known as Amy) doesn&#8217;t look great in fine gowns like her blonde, willowy, ethereal and frankly boring and unknowable sisters. Instead, she loves climbing down the wisteria which grows up the castle walls and sneaking out to the forest.</p>
<p>Thanks to her extremely ordinary looks, Amy turns out to be impossible to marry off. Oh, the shame of it all! Not that our girl is bothered, but the rest of the kingdom is. When she learns of a harebrained scheme to get her rescued from a dragon so a prince will be obliged to marry her, she runs away to the forest, where she lives happily until her clothes start falling apart. So, in need of money to buy a new dress, she goes and gets a job in another palace, living in disguise as an ordinary girl. Where she meets a prince – but I&#8217;ll leave some plot to those who want to read it.</p>
<p>The style of writing makes for a truly luscious fairytale, and the black and white line-drawn illustrations by the author are very pretty too (just the right side of twee). Plot-wise, this book is strongest in its treatment of Amy&#8217;s interaction with Crustacea, her Godmother, who is practical, warm-yet-tough, and advises her to get on with it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s weakest – in my humble socialist opinion – when our girl loves every minute of working insane hours on the lowest rungs of the servant-ladder. C&#8217;mon, girlie, you&#8217;ve worked out it&#8217;ll take you roughly a year to earn enough to buy a new dress. Aren&#8217;t you a bit annoyed at the sucky pay? Also: the insinuation throughout the book that freckles and an upturned nose make someone undateable got on my nerves quite a bit. Freckles can be well hot, and don&#8217;t get me started on pixie faces&#8230;</p>
<p>(Interestingly, each book I&#8217;ve looked at for these posts has often pushed an idea of what a typical beautiful princess looks like, but none of them quite match.)</p>
<p>I was a little disappointed in how conventionally the ends got tied up, but I suppose how the plot came to be is more important than what came to be. Our girl has agency, there&#8217;s no doubt about it. And there&#8217;s nothing wrong with a happy ending.</p>
<h3>Princess Pigsty</h3>

<ul>
<li><em>By Cornelia Funke and Kerstin Meyer, Chickenhouse, 1997</em></li>
</ul>
<p>In <strong>Princess Pigsty</strong> our girl is one of three sisters, who live the traditional fairytale princess life:</p>
<blockquote><p>Their beautiful clothes filled thirty wardrobes. They had footmen to blow their noses for them and ladies-in-waiting to tidy up their rooms, hang up their clothes and polish their crowns until they shone.</p>
<p>Every morning, three teachers taught them royal behaviour – how to sit on a throne without fidgeting, how to curtsey without falling over, how to yawn with your mouth closed and how to smile for a whole hour without taking a break.</p></blockquote>
<p>Isabella, the youngest, despite being perfectly capable of walking the princessy walk, is not happy, and makes her feelings known by waking up the whole castle shouting:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I am tired of being a princess! It&#8217;s boring, boring, boring!”<br />
Her older sisters looked up from their feather pillows in surprise.</p>
<p>“I want to get dirty!” cried Isabella, bouncing around on the bed. “I want to blow my own nose. I don&#8217;t want to smile all the time. I want to make my own sandwiches. I don&#8217;t want to have my hair curled ever again. I do not want to be a princess any more!”</p>
<p>And with that she took her crown and threw it out of the window. Splash! It landed in the goldfish pond.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the pitched battle of wills with the King that follows, Isabella is sent to work in the kitchens until she changes her mind. When she enjoys her work in the kitchens, learning about how their food is made and essentially having too much fun to relent, she&#8217;s sent to the pigsty – where she gets along with the pigs and enjoys their company even more.</p>
<p>Eventually, seeing there is no way around it, her father relents and says she doesn&#8217;t have to be all princessy if she doesn&#8217;t want to – but by now our girl likes the pigs and stays in the pigsty just as often as in her feather bed.</p>
<p>Though no mention is made of any innate unprincessy looks (beyond curled hair), Isabella rejects her princessy role in life quite actively. While Amy of <strong>The Ordinary Princess</strong> is a failure at traditional princessy things (but isn&#8217;t that bothered about it, either) Isabella has lots of guts and lots of agency, not to mention an upbeat and cheerful nature. Eventually her father is won round. The patriarch isn&#8217;t a baddie, and – once it&#8217;s clear she&#8217;s happier that way – he accepts her as she is. Tangled, mucky and doing things that interest her. Hip-hip hooray for doing what you want! Hip-hip hooray for converting people! Hip-hip hooray for male allies!</p>
<h3>Shrek!</h3>

<ul>
<li><em>William Steig, Macmillan, 1990</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Didn&#8217;t know <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrek"><strong>Shrek</strong></a> started out as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrek!">a book</a>? It did, and it was&#8230; not a huge amount like the movie franchise. (Have the first part read to you by Stanley Tucci <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmUC7nsrzlg">here</a>, though sadly without pictures.) Shrek, in both media, is a famously revolting and ugly character, who delights in his own disgustingness (“wherever Shrek went, every living creature fled. How it tickled him to be so repulsive”) &#8211; but that&#8217;s where most of the similarities end.</p>
<p>The book is a very short picture book with a quest narrative. A witch tells Shrek&#8217;s fortune: “Then you wed a princess who/Is even uglier than you.” Shrek decides this sounds great, and goes off in search of this princess.</p>
<blockquote><p>He strode in and his fat lips fell open. There before him was the most stunningly ugly princess on the surface of the planet.</p></blockquote>
<p>When they meet they declare their love for each other&#8217;s revoltingness, and live “horribly ever after.” But if you&#8217;ve seen any of the movies, you&#8217;ll know this wasn&#8217;t quite how it went down when Dreamworks got their hands on it.</p>
<p>In the movie Princess Fiona (who has a name, unlike in the book) is only ugly after dark, &#8211; during the day she appears as a beautiful woman, and during the night she is an ogre, and she&#8217;s self-conscious about it. The only way to cure this is with “true love&#8217;s kiss” – and it&#8217;s initially an unpleasant surprise for her to learn that when the spell is broken she&#8217;s actually stuck with ogre mode constantly.</p>
<p>While the movie does feature a green monster called Shrek and an (eventually) &#8216;ugly&#8217; princess – their unconventionality is treated as something they&#8217;re both self-conscious about. Fiona, especially, with all the princessy expectations heaped upon her, needs reassurance that she&#8217;s loveable.</p>
<p>Alhough the movie doesn&#8217;t mention weight specifically, one of the main factors of Fiona&#8217;s transformation (apart from the green skin) is that she becomes considerably heavier. Fiona is more of an everywoman – learning that she doesn&#8217;t need to be a size 8 to find love – and literally kicking ass. Caitlin Moran tracks the rewrite as part of a post-feminist trend:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the last decade the post-feminist reaction to princesses has been the creation of alternative princesses: the spunky chicks in <strong>Shrek</strong> and the newer Disney films who wear trousers, do kung fu and save the prince.</p></blockquote>
<p>While some cool people (I&#8217;m looking at you, <a href="http://www.babette-cole.com/">Babette Cole</a>) have been subverting these roles for a long time, it takes a while before the effect trickles down to a Hollywood blockbuster and the much wider audience that a movie like <strong>Shrek</strong> can reach.</p>
<p>While the original very short picture book is more about two people with unconventional values and no qualms or neuroses about them – a la <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twits"><strong>The Twits</strong></a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addams_family"><strong>The Addams Family</strong></a> – the movie <strong>Shrek</strong> presents Fiona as someone extremely kickass, but with a fairly conventional narrative of body issues (though admittedly hers are mythical ones) and a postmodern self-consciousness about breaking the known conventions of the &#8216;fairytale&#8217; wedding.</p>
<p>In this way Fiona is far more relatable (and has infintely more agency) than the nameless princess in the book, but part of me is sad that she doesn&#8217;t start with the self-assurance of our happily ugly picturebook princess. After all – if this is a world where gingerbread men can talk and cats can fence – surely we can have a princess who can just get on with her thang <em>without</em> worrying about being pretty enough?</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Now, as the opening music rises I'm sure you cringed as much as I did. But when our enterprising lemonade maker launches into a different language, did you smile instead?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/KNJ0bdV2r9o" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Now, as the opening music rose I&#8217;m sure you cringed as much as I did. But when our enterprising lemonade maker launched into a different language, did you smile instead? There&#8217;s a tendency to ignore or overlook the marketing campaigns of big business and to assume that nothing they ever do can possibly be for the good. After all, they&#8217;re trying to sell us products and services, right? But marketing tries to make us empathise, and to capture our hopes, dreams and ideas for the future. It also guns for mass market appeal.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s the idea: a clever little girl can grow up to be a multinational business leader.</p>
<p>The lemonade stand metaphor is an interesting one, and certainly well used in the fields of business and commerce. It&#8217;s used as the basis of training games for pricing models, economics theory (there&#8217;s a nice <a href="http://pecuniarities.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/calvineconomics.jpg">Calvin and Hobbes one here)</a>, maths tutorials and host of other skills needed to run your own business. It&#8217;s not just a cute thing that kids do; it&#8217;s also about how we introduce children, boys and girls, to the world of work.</p>
<p>The models we use for &#8220;work&#8221; within childhood play set the tone for how we expect children to behave and the roles they might grow into. I remember books on work with pictures of male pilots and female air hostesses. Mothers cleaning the house whilst fathers returned from work.  Some of these have since been pleasingly updated, including the <a href="http://goodmenproject.com/good-feed-blog/social-change-gender-roles-and-richard-scarrys-best-word-book-ever/">Richard Scarry books</a>.</p>
<p>I was told by a friend of mine (who was a boy) that he couldn&#8217;t play with pots and pans because they were &#8220;for girls&#8221;.  We must have been about six. Even though we were actually a rock band. With wooden spoons instead of drumsticks. Maybe we were a girl band.</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>I like the fact that this campaign could have just as easily been done with a young boy and his mother, but instead we have a girl and her dad. A decisive, smart and multi-lingual little girl. Her loving and supportive father, blown away by his daughter&#8217;s abilities.</p>
<p>Future businesswoman of the year, perhaps?</p>

<p>She has a dizzying list of titles to her name, of which I managed to snatch only a portion: most people have heard of <strong>Ballet Shoes</strong>, and, for many, it was a defining childhood book. It&#8217;s a critics&#8217; and writers&#8217; pet: (Dame) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacqueline_Wilson">Jacqueline Wilson</a> cites it as her &#8220;all-time favourite children&#8217;s book&#8221;, and the BBC has twice adapted it for television. Lots of people also know about the other &#8216;Shoes&#8217; books: <strong>Dancing Shoes</strong>, <strong>White Boots</strong>, <strong>Tennis Shoes</strong>, <strong>Ballet Shoes for Anna</strong> and the Carnegie award-winning <strong>The Circus Is Coming</strong>, but maybe less are familiar with <strong>The Children of Primrose Lane, Party Shoes, </strong>the <strong>Gemma </strong>books, or <strong>Caldicott Place</strong>. Certainly, her considerable output of books for adults has largely gone unnoticed (one of which formed the basis for <strong>Ballet Shoes </strong>itself) and I myself have only read one: <strong>Saplings</strong>, an experimental novel that explores contemporary thought about child psychology in the aftermath of war. Somewhat disturbingly, it is still written from Streatfeild&#8217;s distinctive &#8216;child&#8217;s-eye-view&#8217;, from which vantage point it addresses issues as varied as depression, alcoholism, sex, bed-wetting, bereavement and female self-esteem (not all at once, of course).</p>

<p>It has been often commented that Streatfeild&#8217;s gift is her ability to establish a rapport with her reader: she never talks down to children, and deals with difficult topics in the same way she describes everyday occurrences. Her commitment to realism in writing extends to her habit of painstakingly explaining what all the characters are thinking at all times. Thus, in <strong>Dancing Shoes</strong>, the just-orphaned Rachel is considered unloving and aggressive because she took her mother&#8217;s death with equanimity: we the readers, on the other hand, are kept aware of Rachel&#8217;s trials &#8211; how she scowls to keep from crying and wants to avoid any questions that might set her off. The child-reader is nevertheless forced to see the situation from at least two perspectives simultaneously, a common approach to Literature since Samuel Richardson, but amazingly innovative in writing for children. The result is a style that demands a responsibility from its readers as well as understanding: it accepts that life is often unfair, but invites children to consider how best to respond.</p>
<p>Streatfeild was famously the &#8216;unattractive&#8217; middle girl in a clergyman&#8217;s family of three daughters. After the &#8216;beautiful child&#8217; tradition of nineteenth-century children&#8217;s literature (best represented by <strong>Frances Hodgson Burnett</strong> and <strong>Lewis Carroll</strong>), her novels frequently focus on the rebellious, the stubborn and the plain, than which no better example exists than the &#8216;black-doggish&#8217; Jane Winter in <strong>The Painted Garden</strong>, which meta-fictionally reworks Hodgson Burnett&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_Garden">most famous novel</a> on a film set in Hollywood. In the absence of naive beauty and idyllic country settings, her characters must make their way on merit, and, not only plain, they are often money-minded to a startling degree: &#8220;The law lets me work; I don&#8217;t need a licence, and I can do what I like with my own money,&#8221; asserts Pauline, in <strong>Ballet Shoes</strong>, at fourteen (and she gets her way).</p>

<p>The central conceit of this novel<strong> </strong>&#8211; the absence of Great Uncle Matthew (&#8220;Gum&#8221;), who adopts the three &#8216;Fossils&#8217; and then dashes off to &#8220;some strange islands&#8221; &#8211; means that the book features an essentially all-female cast. Aside from the Fossils themselves &#8211; Pauline, Petrova and Posy &#8211; the house in Cromwell Road also contains Sylvia, the children&#8217;s guardian (&#8220;Garnie&#8221;); Nana, a no-nonsense disciplinarian; Theo Dane, a dancing teacher at the Children&#8217;s Academy of Dancing and Stage Training, and Dr Smith and Dr Jakes, doctors of Maths and English respectively. These last two later move on to &#8220;a charming flat in Bloomsbury&#8221; and although aged seven I never thought to ask why two female doctors should have to live together, now I wonder if Streatfeild has not rather audaciously put a lesbian couple in a 1930s kids&#8217; book (there are some rumours about the nature of the friendships she shared with women herself, and she has been claimed variously for a lesbian and an asexual). Certainly the illustration of the Doctors by Ruth Gervis suggests she saw it that way, even if Streatfeild may not have done: they are depicted in a stereotypical style that has barely changed since the novel was written in 1936.</p>
<p>The only man in sight, apart from the absent Gum, is Mr Simpson, a border who teaches Petrova all about cars and then must go back to his &#8216;rubber trees&#8217; in Kuala Lumpur. And while Pauline and Posy have looks and interests to endear them to the most pink and fluffy reader going, Petrova remains as stubbornly boyish as that perennially scruffy heroine of female fiction, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Women"><strong>Little Women</strong></a>&#8216;s Jo: when the dancing school plan is first mentioned, Nana hopes it will &#8220;turn her more like a little lady&#8221; &#8211; Petrova &#8220;never plays with dolls, and takes no more interest in her clothes than a scarecrow&#8221;.</p>
<p>Alas for Nana, Petrova ends up spending auditions &#8220;flying an imaginary airplane on a new route to China&#8221;, and by the end of the book, is a determined aviator: &#8220;Amy Mollison and Jean Batten will be [in the history books], but not as important at you&#8221;, promises Pauline, imagining the distinctly un-fluffy story such books will tell: &#8216;[She] found routes by which goods could be carried at greater speed and less cost, and so she revolutionized trade.&#8221; Hardly the dreams of a &#8216;beautiful child&#8217;.</p>
<p>For Petrova, as for so many of Streatfeild&#8217;s children not given to performing art (and there are a surprising number, despite her reputation), the most important lesson of stage school is self-sufficiency, a goal underlined across all the books by the fact that the overwhelming majority of child-characters have no parents to speak of, or are lumbered with a domineering guardian to struggle against (notably in <strong>Ballet Shoes For Anna</strong> and <strong>White Boots</strong>). With their realist emphasis, and the lessons that &#8216;even&#8217; little girls can get on in a world assailed by stupidity, war, and even natural disasters, I can think of no better author to recommend to absolutely everyone you know.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<h6 style="text-align: center;">G</h6>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">GIRL</h2>
<blockquote><p>And alone in the midst of all this lumber and decay, and ugly age, the beautiful child in her gentle slumber, smiling through her light and sunny dreams.<br />
&#8211; <strong>Charles Dickens, The Old Curiosity Shop</strong> (1841)</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8216;Twas brillig</strong></p>
<p>Picture the linguistic landscape of the thirteenth century. Full of bastard Latin, Anglo-Norman, smatterings of Anglo-Saxon crudities, and a few words whose origins nobody knows. Sometime around 1290, the word <em>girl </em>appeared, used to signify ‘a child or young person of either sex’, alongside clarifying compounds <em>knave girl </em>and <em>gay girl </em>(‘boy’ and, er, ‘girl’ respectively). Like some tantalisingly similar words &#8211; <em>lad, lass, boy </em>&#8211; its provenance is unclear, although some cunning linguists would have it derive ultimately (via some torturous and dark history) from the Greek &#8216;parthenos&#8217; (=&#8217;virgin&#8217;). But yes, uh huh, you read right: in its earliest incarnation, <em>girl </em>was ungendered. In fact, it was not until the 1530s that its more specific application to XX chromosomes surfaced, with <em>girl </em>meaning ‘a female child’ &#8211; and even then, it still had its enduring reference to &#8216;a roebuck in its second year&#8217;, with roe<em>buck</em> being, naturally, the male equivalent of <em>roe</em> (a deer, a female deer).</p>
<h3>Dear, dear</h3>

<p>So the Sylvanian Deer Family would be made up of a roebuck, a roedeer, and, perhaps a (male) girl. Not actually that uncommon: after all, we classify animals via male, female and child (calf, cow, bull; pup, bitch, dog) with a third, genderless young&#8217;un alongside their sexually mature parents all the time.</p>
<p>Here comes an art history aside to <em>girl&#8217;</em>s ambiguous beginnings: glancing, for example at<a href="http://gallery.e2bn.org/imagelarge70483-abolition.html"> Queen Victoria with her family</a>, a  <a href="http://www.artchive.com/artchive/v/velazquez/velazquez_prince.jpg">young prince of Spain</a>, or even an English <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/exhibitions/hogarth/images/works/the_graham_children.jpg">merchant family of the 1740s</a>, the gender identities of the under-6s seem, well, fluid at best. I should add that, in the case of the Spanish Royal Family, the eldest prince (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balthasar_Charles,_Prince_of_Asturias">Baltasar Carlos</a>) leaps straight from painterly petticoats to politically potent riding gear and full armour with apparently no mid-point whatsoever. Another prince, the young Charles II, appears in full armour aged twelve, although in his case there were excellent practical reasons for the switchover (lol revolution). There is also James Northcote&#8217;s portrait (right) of John Ruskin, art historian, antiquarian, arguable founder of the National Trust, patron of the Pre-Raphaelites and sometime author &#8211; aged three and a half. Manly indeed.</p>
<p>This could speak of a reluctance to bother gendering the child until that gender could be of socio-political relevance (something infant mortality could only have encouraged), but that is not to say it went un-bemoaned by the children themselves. The poet Rainer Maria Rilke complained bitterly of his mother&#8217;s reign of sartorial terror: &#8216;I had to wear beautiful long dresses, and until I started school I went about like a little girl. I think my mother played with me as though I were a big <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/10/25/an-alphabet-of-femininism-4-d-is-for-doll/">doll</a>.&#8217; I am also reminded of the story that hit headlines in Sweden about<a href="http://www.thelocal.se/20232/20090623/"> a couple who refused to gender their two-year-old at all, for fear of falling into gender&#8217;s traps</a>.</p>
<h3>Not yet a woman</h3>

<p>But, as we may ask of this Swedish child, what happens to <em>girl </em>once its gender has been set? Well, one of its first gender-specific definitions is, as of 1668, ‘a maid of all work’; <em>sweetheart</em> or <em>mistress</em> makes its appearance towards the end of the eighteenth century (as in the popular song ‘The Girl I Left Behind Me&#8217;); and it appears in compound reference to prostitution – <em>a kind girl, girl about town</em>. These are all potentially belittling terms for female-orientated stations in life, which can nonetheless retain a flattering appeal ­– think <a href="http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0027816/">Patsy Stone</a> and her insistence on being referred to as &#8216;mademoiselle&#8217;; or, more psychotically, think Bette Davis in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ck-Uo52MOg">W<em>hatever Happened To Baby Jane</em></a>?</p>
<p>So, actually, as <em>girl </em>grows up, it sexes up: indeed, once gendered firmly female, its sexual identity becomes more complicated, and this is something that seems to go alongside a developing idea of what early youth actually <em>is</em>. It is only really with the Victorians that the ‘cult of childhood’ really came into being, upheld by luminaries such as J. M. Barrie, Ruskin himself, Charles Dickens and, of course, Lewis Carroll.</p>
<p>This is where whispers start snaking around history, and it feels fitting that the term <em>paedophilia erotica </em>did not come into diagnostic existence until 1886, for this was arguably the first time childhood was regarded with fetishism (as later underlines the actions of &#8216;poet and pervert&#8217; Humbert Humbert, in Nabokov&#8217;s now-notorious <em>Lolita</em>). <em>Girls</em> suddenly become not simply small genderless adults, but (feminine) symbols of what adulthood is seen to lack: innocence, purity and beauty, as in Dickens&#8217; <em>The Old Curiosity Shop</em>, whose Little Nell loves to say her prayers. Dickens&#8217; adult females fare little better, of course, and the Victorian infantalisation of women proves <em>girl </em>in grown-up action, and a topic for another day.</p>
<p>This, then, is the context for Carroll&#8217;s photography, but it is important to note that, whatever their evidence for something darker, their subject matter was by no means original: Carroll&#8217;s contemporary, Julia Margaret Cameron, produced many <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_MmRVVROy-Jo/ShwBSPlo2CI/AAAAAAAADAE/gxI5PfHTgNM/s400/Julia+Margaret+Cameron6.jpg">similar images</a> (worksafety check: mild nudity) that played on girlish simplicity for typically Victorian effect.</p>
<blockquote><p>[She was] the most beautiful little girl that Tom had ever seen. Her cheeks were almost as white as the pillow and her hair was like threads of gold spread all about over the bed.</p>
<p>He wondered if she was a real live person, or one of the wax dolls he had seen in the shops.</p>
<p>&#8211; Charles Kingsley, The Water Babies (1862-3)</p></blockquote>
<p>A strange journey, then: a word that commences genderless and ends sexualised and technically belittling (&#8216;the checkout girl&#8217;), but without much perceptible backlash from the female population. Are we not all Patsy Stones?</p>
