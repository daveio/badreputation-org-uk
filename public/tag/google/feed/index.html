										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Short answer?  Not a lot.  I find myself in the post-epic lull that tends to happen to me after I&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/04/18/gamer-diary-mass-effect-3/">powered through a great big game </a>all the way through &#8211; I end up just being a bit frazzled.  This has lasted longer than usual, possibly because I find myself in the odd position of having actually read a book.  That sounds much more self-condescending that it ought to: what I mean is that I am terrible at finishing books &#8211; there&#8217;s a good 10-20 half-read titles populating the shelves here.  This month however, I got through a whole one, from start to finish, but this may just have something to do with my new job (in a library).</p>
<p>Why am I babbling about books?  Because I&#8217;m trying to explain, as best I can, why I haven&#8217;t done much gaming this month.  Or, at least, not much that I can bring new content to you with.  There was some more <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/04/11/gamer-diary-what-ive-been-playing-march-2012/">Kinect</a> &#8211; my parents are better at the bowling game than I am &#8211; and some other little bits and pieces like a quick foray onto <a href="http://www.tf2.com/"><strong>Team Fortress 2</strong></a> to craft weapons and hats.</p>
<p>So, my apologies for the brevity of this post!  What I did play was <strong>Portal 2</strong>, on the &#8216;Play Day&#8217; that marked the one year anniversary of its release.  I thought it&#8217;d be a good thing to write about, so I did a Google and it turned out we (BadRep) are the <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/06/13/found-feminism-portal-2-and-saints-row-2-but-not-brink/">second result</a> when you search for &#8220;Portal 2 feminist&#8221;.</p>
<div id="attachment_10777" style="width: 513px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Google-BR.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10777" data-attachment-id="10777" data-permalink="/2012/05/09/gamer-diary-what-ive-been-playing-april-2012/google-br/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Google-BR.png?fit=839%2C322&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="839,322" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Google Results: Portal 2 feminist" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Google-BR.png?fit=300%2C115&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Google-BR.png?fit=839%2C322&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-10777 " src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Google-BR.png?resize=503%2C193" alt="A screen shot of a Google search results for term &quot;Portal 2 feminist&quot; and a link to a Bad Reputation article as the second in the list." width="503" height="193" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Google-BR.png?w=839&amp;ssl=1 839w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Google-BR.png?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Google-BR.png?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w" sizes="(max-width: 503px) 100vw, 503px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-10777" class="wp-caption-text">Look! There we are! Second in the results!</p></div>
<p>I also had a gander at that top link and presented my counter-argument over on my own blog <a title="The Talking Automaton: Portal 2" href="http://thetalkingautomaton.wordpress.com/2012/04/19/portal2/" target="_blank">here</a>, which some of you who follow us <a href="http://twitter.com/badrepuk">on Twitter</a> might have already seen.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t want to simply regurgitate what I&#8217;ve already written elsewhere all over BR, which is why this is such a short post, but if I may, I&#8217;ll show you what I&#8217;m excited for in the upcoming Gaming Future.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Portal 2</strong>: <a title="YouTube: Perpetual Testing Initiative" href="http://youtu.be/b7rZO2ACP3A" target="_blank">Aperture Perpetual Testing Initiative</a> &#8211; May 8th</li>
<li><strong>Diablo III</strong> &#8211; <a title="YouTube: Diablo III cinematic trailer" href="http://youtu.be/EgbUSsblCSQ" target="_blank">Finally being released</a>(!) and I&#8217;m looking forward to playing as some of those <a title="YouTube: Diablo 3 Demon Hunter Trailer" href="http://youtu.be/8scZZfU9Zh8" target="_blank">kick-ass looking fem-versions</a> <em>(apart from those stupid heels, ugh, seriously?!)</em> &#8211; May 15th (UK)</li>
<li><strong>Max Payne 3</strong> &#8211; More for the technology than the<em> (totally original &#8211; hurhur)</em> <a title="YouTube: Max Payne 3 Trailer #2" href="http://youtu.be/JTPRPr15sW0" target="_blank">damsel-in-distress</a> storyline &#8211; May 15th</li>
</ul>
<p>Later on, there&#8217;s also <a title="Borderlands 2 Launch Date Trailer" href="http://youtu.be/MCWJUSulnro" target="_blank"><strong>Borderlands 2</strong></a> which I&#8217;m looking forward to, and <a title="Crysis 3 trailer" href="http://youtu.be/g5NNkyDt65w" target="_blank"><strong>Crysis 3</strong></a> but I have to finish <strong>Crysis 2</strong> first &#8211; oops!  I&#8217;ll also endeavour to play something a bit less, er&#8230; shooty and more casual, for those of you out there who don&#8217;t really do the FPS thing.  Hopefully I&#8217;ll get some new tech over the summer to help on that front.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll also be writing up some interesting posts about humour and gender in games, and I might do some &#8216;case study&#8217; style posts on some of the prominent female characters out there.  I&#8217;ll do my best to bring you more exciting tales next month!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If I had a time machine, I would go back through history, picking up awesome chicks and bringing them back to the present. I would finally be able to giggle with glee as Victorians tried to work out how the tiny people got inside the TV and ancient Greeks marvelled at printed books, not to mention what showing them the internet might do! There are certain women, certain amazing icons, who would fit right into the modern world. They would be able to work, love, live and breathe, far away from the limitations placed on them in their own time. Here are five of them. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, 2012 is no utopia &#8211; we still have our battles and our injustices &#8211; but compared to any other time in history, the 21st century is a pretty awesome place for ladies.</p>
<h3>Sappho</h3>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/sappho.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="10786" data-permalink="/2012/05/02/guest-post-if-i-had-a-time-machine-five-historical-women-who-would-thrive-in-the-21st-century/sappho/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/sappho.jpg?fit=300%2C240&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="300,240" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="sappho" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/sappho.jpg?fit=300%2C240&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/sappho.jpg?fit=300%2C240&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-10786 alignright" title="sappho" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/sappho.jpg?resize=270%2C216" alt="Sappho on an Attic red-figure vase c.470 BC. Image via Wikipedia, shared under fair use guidelines." width="270" height="216" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Sappho gave birth to two of my favourite things: lyric poetry and lesbianism. Born in 630 BC on the island of Lesbos, Sappho had a pretty good life, considering her gender. She was rich, talented and of good social standing. Her poetry, which she performed with a lyre (she invented a new subtype of the instrument, and the plectrum, of all things) was well-respected. She had her face on coins and on vases. But she was pretty lonely. The girls in her circle (which was either a religious order, something like a preparatory class or simply a gathering of women, depending on which scholars you believe) would all leave her when they married, and when she fell in love with them, she knew that they would inevitably part. She probably never married herself (accounts differ, but most <a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/restless1.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="10787" data-permalink="/2012/05/02/guest-post-if-i-had-a-time-machine-five-historical-women-who-would-thrive-in-the-21st-century/restless1/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/restless1.jpg?fit=500%2C281&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="500,281" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="restless1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/restless1.jpg?fit=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/restless1.jpg?fit=500%2C281&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-10787 alignright" title="restless1" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/restless1-300x168.jpg?resize=243%2C136" alt="Still from the Buffy episode Restless. A caucasian blonde woman is lying on her stomach, looking over her shoulder at her back, which has Greek script painted onto her flesh in black ink.

<p>If I could go back and get her in my time machine, I&#8217;d sign her up to a dating site, put in a DVD of the <strong>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</strong> episode “Restless” (which features a lesbian writing Sappho&#8217;s poetry on her lover&#8217;s back) and explain to her that when she met the right lady, she would be able to date her, live with her, and in some parts of the world, marry her.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d show her this video, of Ellen and Portia&#8217;s wedding:</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/aWgvqruYdbQ?rel=0" frameborder="0" width="420" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>And I would be so excited because, in this time of technology, the beautiful poetry she would no doubt produce, probably about the woman she would eventually meet online, would never be lost and never be forgotten.</p>
<h3>Ada Lovelace</h3>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Ada_lovelace.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="10788" data-permalink="/2012/05/02/guest-post-if-i-had-a-time-machine-five-historical-women-who-would-thrive-in-the-21st-century/ada_lovelace/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Ada_lovelace.jpg?fit=225%2C310&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="225,310" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Ada_lovelace" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Ada_lovelace.jpg?fit=217%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Ada_lovelace.jpg?fit=225%2C310&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-10788 alignright" title="Ada_lovelace" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Ada_lovelace-217x300.jpg?resize=195%2C270" alt="Victorian image of Ada Lovelace in a purple satin gown, holding a fan delicately. Image via Wikipedia, shared under Fair Use guidelines." width="195" height="270" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Ada_lovelace.jpg?w=217&amp;ssl=1 217w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Ada_lovelace.jpg?w=225&amp;ssl=1 225w" sizes="(max-width: 195px) 100vw, 195px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Ada Lovelace was a genius. Born in 1815 in London, she was the product of very short-lived marriage of mad, bad asshole poet Byron and staunchly moral abolitionist Anne Isabelle Milbanke. Schooled in mathematics from an early age, at the behest of a mother desperately trying to prevent her from turning out like her father, Ada began corresponding with important intellectuals on a variety of subjects while she was still in her teens, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage">Charles Babbage</a>. The notes she included with her translation of an Italian mathematician&#8217;s article about Babbage&#8217;s Difference Engine were revolutionary and contained the very first working programming language, leading her to be seen as history&#8217;s first computer programmer.</p>
<p>If I could go to the Victorian period and pick her up, I&#8217;d go for the bright young Ada, before the affairs and the gambling. I&#8217;d show her iphones and laptops and cash machines, making it clear to her that none of this would exist without her. I&#8217;d take her to the Apple store and show her an iPad. I&#8217;d open a browser and let her google until she thought her head would explode with the sheer scope of it all. Then I&#8217;d go to the Google careers page and make her <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w887NIa_V9w">fill out an application</a>.</p>
<h3>Emily Dickinson</h3>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/emilydickinson.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="10789" data-permalink="/2012/05/02/guest-post-if-i-had-a-time-machine-five-historical-women-who-would-thrive-in-the-21st-century/emilydickinson/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/emilydickinson.jpg?fit=220%2C273&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="220,273" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="emilydickinson" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/emilydickinson.jpg?fit=220%2C273&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/emilydickinson.jpg?fit=220%2C273&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-10789" title="emilydickinson" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/emilydickinson.jpg?resize=220%2C273" alt="Black and white portrait photo of a young Emily Dickinson. She is pale with dark hair tied severely back from her face, and wears a dark coloured high necked dress. Image via Wikipedia, shared under Fair Use guidelines." width="220" height="273" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Born in 1830, in Amherst, Massachusetts, Emily Dickinson was not a famous poet during her lifetime. She was not a famous anything during her lifetime. </p>
<p>Known by her neighbours as an eccentric who dressed in white and rarely left the house, she wrote almost two thousand poems, only ten of which were ever published while she was living. Her fascination with mortality, due to numerous personal tragedies, along with her concise, free verse style, made her work a little too ahead of its time to be appreciated until much later. She was an avid letter writer and by the end of her life she was communicating almost exclusively via the written word.</p>
<p>If I could go back, I&#8217;d whisk Emily away from the early 1860s, when she was a fiercely creative thirty-something. I&#8217;d set her up in a nice apartment with a pretty garden – little known fact: Emily Dickinson was much better known for her gardening than for her writing in her lifetime – and hand her a shiny new laptop. After a hopefully brief, not too infuriating tutorial on the technological revolution, I&#8217;d <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgNIIUD_oQg&amp;list=UU_UWaQiCQi4S5O2LbU-SK5w&amp;index=4&amp;feature=plcp">introduce her to Facebook and Skype</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d show her how easy it is to instantly communicate with individuals from all over the globe and all walks of life whenever she pleased. I&#8217;d explain to her that now, with these tools at her fingertips, she could have her precious solitude without sacrificing the social stimulation she clearly craved. Next, I&#8217;d direct her attention to the numerous writers&#8217; communities online. I&#8217;d show her the pages and pages of poetry &#8211; and the range of quality, from emo teens to professional writers. I&#8217;d encourage her to get involved and post daily. Finally one of the most under-appreciated poets of the nineteenth century would be able share her thoughts, feelings and art with like-minded individuals without ever having to leave her desk.</p>
<h3>Amelia Earhart</h3>

She wanted to fly, so she flew. She wanted to fly all the way across the Atlantic, so she signed up to command a flight piloted by men in a project funded by a rich woman. She wanted to do the trip for real, solo, and a few years later, she did. In 1937, she decided she wanted to be the first to fly around the world, and sadly, this was where it all went wrong. She disappeared in the air, having flown almost the entire way around the world with only a navigator accompanying her. There are too many theories about how and why this happened to mention, but the most accepted explanation is mistakes were made, preparation was shoddy and she ran out of fuel over the ocean, plummeting to a watery grave.</p>
<p>If I could go back and get her, I&#8217;d go back to the early Thirties, and pick her up after her solo flight across the Atlantic, before she was forced to endorse product after product just to maintain her high profile, and before the press began their obligatory backlash, calling her flying chops into question. </p>
<p>I&#8217;d sit her down on my bed, fire up my laptop, and show her YouTube videos of women flying commercial flights and flying for fun and flying as fighter pilots. I&#8217;d show her this video of the Women In Aviation conference in San Diego:</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/OQNJiJj8ly8?rel=0" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>Most importantly, I&#8217;d tell her that flying is now safe. The technology has caught up with her dreams and it is very unlikely, in the age of GPS and state of the art air traffic control, that what happened to her would happen now. I would also let her know that now, it is possible to set off to circumnavigate the globe before breakfast and arrive home in time for tea!</p>

Yep, really. In a time when most women would never think about trying to write a word, let alone publishing under their own name, Cavendish was a famous and controversial writer. </p>
<p>Her critics complained about her spelling and grammar as much as they did about her writing at all. They also criticised her outlandish style of dress, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Cavendish,_Duchess_of_Newcastle-upon-Tyne">calling</a> her “mad, conceited, and ridiculous” &#8211; but her originality, paired with her keen interest in and interpretation of early science, made her popular.</p>
<p>If I could journey back to the 17th century, I would go to 1668, the year <strong>The Blazing World</strong> was published, and I&#8217;d bring Margaret back here. The first thing I would do is encourage her to get tested for dyslexia, as some scholars have suggested that this would have accounted for her terrible spelling and grammar. I&#8217;d show her women delivering lectures on TED about robotics and neuroscience:</p>

<p>I&#8217;d get her an application for Oxford University and introduce her to Microsoft Word complete with the lifesaving blessing that is spell check. Once she was accepted at Oxford, she&#8217;d get all sorts of support for her dyslexia, and shiny equipment. She would excel at all her subjects, even the ones that weren&#8217;t invented in her time. I&#8217;d watch her study, graduate, write and publish, and then become an academic, scientist, writer or all three. I&#8217;d sit back, hope for another science fiction novel, and smile smugly when she cured cancer.</p>
<p>Sadly, there ain&#8217;t no such thing as time travel. It&#8217;s likely there never will be. But I can wonder and I can dream. And I can use thought experiments like this to remind myself I have the freedom to love whomever I choose, aim as high as I choose, live however I choose and be respected for it. How very lucky I was to be born in 1984.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The wonderful website Letters of Note is always worth reading, and recently they posted a letter which made me reflect on how far we've come in a few decades.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The wonderful website <a href="http://www.lettersofnote.com"><strong>Letters of Note</strong></a> is always worth reading (or <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/LettersOfNote">following on twitter</a>), and recently they posted a letter which made me reflect on how far we&#8217;ve come in a few decades.</p>
<p>Astronomer and physicist <a href="http://www.lettersofnote.com/2011/03/if-membership-is-restricted-to-men-loss.html">Carl Sagan wrote in 1981 to an organisation called &#8220;The Explorers Club&#8221;.</a> Some history is needed here: this was a group founded in 1905 in New York, as a club for those who pursue &#8220;Scientific Exploration&#8221; (including both Explorers and Scientists). A letterhead he mentions in the note says <em>To the conquest of the unknown and the advancement of knowledge.</em> Back around 1900, the idea that women could be part of either of those professions or join the club wasn&#8217;t considered. The club then remained men-only for decades in the name of tradition.</p>
<p>Sagan was adding his voice to others in the early 1980s asking that women should be allowed to be members. His letter is polite, but one middle paragraph is a brilliant list of women who have contributed to the pursuit of new knowledge:</p>
<blockquote><p>There are several women astronauts. The earliest footprints &#8212; 3.6 million years old &#8212; made by a member of the human family have been found in a volcanic ash flow in Tanzania by <strong>Mary Leakey</strong>. Trailblazing studies of the behavior of primates in the wild have been performed by dozens of young women, each spending years with a different primate species. <strong>Jane Goodall</strong>&#8216;s studies of the chimpanzee are the best known of the investigations which illuminate human origins. The undersea depth record is held by <strong>Sylvia Earle</strong> [pictured below]. The solar wind was first measured in situ by <strong>Marcia Neugebauer</strong>, using the Mariner 2 spacecraft. The first active volcanoes beyond the Earth were discovered on the Jovian moon Io by <strong>Linda Morabito</strong>, using the Voyager 1 spacecraft. These examples of modern exploration and discovery could be multiplied a hundredfold.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.explorers.org/index.php">The Explorers Club</a> changed their policy later that year, and now do not restrict based on gender.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not the part which gives me hope.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/earle.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="8500" data-permalink="/2011/11/17/a-snapshot-of-the-past/earle/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/earle.jpg?fit=800%2C525&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="800,525" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="earle" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/earle.jpg?fit=300%2C196&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/earle.jpg?fit=800%2C525&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/earle-300x196.jpg?resize=300%2C196" alt="Photo of a Caucasian woman (Sylvia Earle) in a snorkel mask and red diving suit showing something to another white woman who is inside what appears to be a diving bell or behind a glass screen. Photo via Wikipedia shared under fair use guidelines." title="earle" width="300" height="196" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8500" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/earle.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/earle.jpg?w=457&amp;ssl=1 457w, https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/earle.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>If you read the rest of Sagan&#8217;s letter, the extraordinary thing today is how reasonable he&#8217;s being. He&#8217;s genuinely trying to convince the Club, using facts and appealing to logic, that they should make this change. There&#8217;s no hint of anger or appeal to fairness. He doesn&#8217;t say women deserve equality, and only calmly points out that if you want a &#8216;social club for the boys&#8217; you shouldn&#8217;t claim to represent all scientists and explorers in 1981. In fact he (as a member) acts as though they could have every right to exclude women because of tradition, but that they&#8217;re mistaken and women should in fact qualify under their own rules. (I&#8217;m not saying Sagan wasn&#8217;t passionate about equality, at all &#8211; his belief in it comes through clearly in many of his books and documentaries, and he&#8217;s an absolute hero. I think he was being deliberately polite.)</p>
<p>However, I expect that someone writing to the Explorers Club today might send a very different message. A message which includes the questions &#8220;What do you think you&#8217;re doing?&#8221; and &#8220;Why are you being so incredibly blinkered?&#8221;. I can well believe that there was prejudice against the quality of women&#8217;s roles in science in 1981: there&#8217;s prejudice <em>now</em>. But I think the average expectation of what is normal and fair has genuinely shifted, to the point that Sagan&#8217;s letter reads as quite oddly passive today.</p>
<p>In the week when Google <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/nov/07/marie-curie-birth-google-doodle?newsfeed=true">celebrated Marie Curie&#8217;s 144th birthday</a>, I enjoy anything which reminds us that we need to <a href="http://xkcd.com/896/">move away from the token lady scientist</a> when looking at women&#8217;s roles in the discovery of new frontiers. This letter is, I hope, an anachronism today. I also dearly hope it won&#8217;t seem normal again in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Image is important. Sad but true. And it is widely held that feminism has an image problem. I thought I’d do some of my famous research into what the internet says feminism looks like.</p>
<p>This is an exciting web 3.0 INTERACTIVE post, rather than one that&#8217;s full of pictures, because of copyright licensing laws. When you hear this noise &#8211; <strong>*ping!*</strong> &#8211; click the link and hopefully the search results will open in a new window for you to enjoy.</p>
<h3>Google Images</h3>
<p>*<a title="Google Image search results for feminism" href="http://www.google.co.uk/images?hl=en&amp;source=imghp&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=583&amp;q=feminism&amp;btnG=Search+Images&amp;gbv=2&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=" target="_blank">ping!</a>*</p>
<p>Google provide personalized search results of course, so what you see when you Google images of feminism is probably different from what I’m seeing. But what I got is for the most part old favourites, and mostly images created by or appropriated by the feminist movement. I love these pictures. But they are getting kind of old:</p>

<li>A      painting by Artemisia Gentileschi. It’s ‘<a title="Judith Beheading Holofernes, by Artemisia Gentileschi" href="http://schwarzemilch.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/femns_gentles-jud-behd-lg.jpg">Judith beheading Holofernes</a>’, in      fact. Bet she was a feminist too &#8211; we can’t get enough of violence against      men, apparently (more on which later)</li>
</ul>
<p>In amongst these are the anti-feminist blogger’s illustration of choice, the demotivational poster.</p>
<h3><strong>Clipart</strong></h3>
<p>*<a title="Clipart.com" href="http://www.clipart.com/en/search/split?a=a&amp;show=all&amp;k_mode=all&amp;q=feminism" target="_blank">ping!</a>*</p>
<p>These days, some people pretend to be dorky to be cool. I’m the real deal. My major love-in with clipart was at secondary school when I decided to make a school newsletter. No one would do it with me, so I wrote and laid it out and printed it and distributed it in all the classrooms by myself. There was no second issue.</p>
<p>Anyway. Clipart offerings for feminism were pretty thin on the ground, and included:</p>
<ul>
<li>A      burning bra. Sigh. It <a title="Snopes" href="http://www.snopes.com/history/american/burnbra.asp">never happened</a>, you know.</li>
<li>A      woman <a title="Clipart.com " href="http://www.clipart.com/en/close-up?o=5200454&amp;memlevel=A&amp;a=a&amp;q=feminism&amp;k_mode=all&amp;s=1&amp;e=8&amp;show=&amp;c=&amp;cid=&amp;findincat=&amp;g=&amp;cc=&amp;page=&amp;k_exc=&amp;pubid=">dressed as a man</a>! Well, in a shirt and a tie.</li>
<li>That      female symbol again.</li>
<li>A woman      with a placard.</li>
<li>Three      women in red – one in a <a title="Clipart.com - boardroom" href="http://www.clipart.com/en/close-up?o=4910620&amp;memlevel=A&amp;a=a&amp;q=feminism&amp;k_mode=all&amp;s=1&amp;e=8&amp;show=&amp;c=&amp;cid=&amp;findincat=&amp;g=&amp;cc=&amp;page=&amp;k_exc=&amp;pubid=">boardroom</a>, one in a <a title="Clipart.com - boxing ring" href="http://www.clipart.com/en/close-up?o=4909709&amp;memlevel=A&amp;a=a&amp;q=feminism&amp;k_mode=all&amp;s=1&amp;e=8&amp;show=&amp;c=&amp;cid=&amp;findincat=&amp;g=&amp;cc=&amp;page=&amp;k_exc=&amp;pubid=">boxing ring</a>, and one hefting      her <a title="Clipart.com - skating" href="http://www.clipart.com/en/close-up?o=5046801&amp;memlevel=A&amp;a=a&amp;q=feminism&amp;k_mode=all&amp;s=1&amp;e=8&amp;show=&amp;c=&amp;cid=&amp;findincat=&amp;g=&amp;cc=&amp;page=&amp;k_exc=&amp;pubid=">male skating partner</a> on high.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those women in red are just the tip of the iceberg in representations of feminism as women fighting / besting / attacking / murdering men, it turns out&#8230;</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3>Stock Photos</h3>
<p>Famously bizarre friend of the low budget publication producer, there is nothing quite like browsing cheap stock photography websites. There’s even a <a title="Awkward Stock Photos" href="http://awkwardstockphotos.com/">tumblr</a> dedicated to some of the more outlandish findings.</p>
<p>Let’s start with <strong>iStockPhoto</strong>.</p>
<p>*<a title="iStock Photo search results for feminism" href="http://www.istockphoto.com/search/text/feminism/source/basic/#1082f61b" target="_blank">ping!</a>*<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Yes, that’s right. The first image to come up under ‘feminism’ is a woman holding a gun to her sleeping partner’s head. See also:</p>

<p>I find this simultaneously worrying, revealing and hilarious. There we were, slogging away, trying to get recognised as a valid and powerful political movement and to assert our credibility as a critical paradigm, and it turns out all the people creating and using these images are afraid that we’re going to come and BEAT THEM UP.</p>
<p>Other things come up too, but the women-attacking-men theme is pretty striking. One notable exception is this unbelieveable piece of tastelessness: <a title="IStock Photo: Sexy woman wearing a burkha" href="http://www.istockphoto.com/stock-photo-15677001-sexy-woman-wearing-a-burkha.php">“Sexy woman wearing a Burkha”</a>.</p>
<p>On to<strong> Shutterstock</strong>, a much friendlier and sexier place, it turns out.</p>
<p>*<a title="Shutterstock search results for feminism" href="http://www.shutterstock.com/s/feminism/search-p1.html?x=0&amp;y=0&amp;search_source=search_form&amp;lang=en&amp;search_group=" target="_blank">ping!</a>*</p>
<p>There’s really too great a variety of bizarre representations of feminism here for me to summarise, but highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>One      half of a “<a title="Shutterstock - Sexy young couple" href="http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-64529791/stock-photo-portrait-of-a-sexy-young-couple.html">sexy young couple</a>” smooshing her partner’s face</li>
<li>“<a title="Shutterstock - glamour still life" href="http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-822424/stock-photo-glamor-still-life.html">Glamor      still life</a>”</li>
<li>A      serene <a title="Shutterstock - headless woman" href="http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-10311232/stock-photo-phantom-of-beautiful-elegant-woman.html">headless phantom</a> feminist</li>
<li>An <a title="Shutterstock bag" href="http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-60828085/stock-photo-brown-leather-bag.html"> old bag</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The violence against men is present, but it’s more symbolic – women are cutting or stamping on their ties – or implied: the boxing gloves are back, and this enterprising <a title="Shutterstock - rifle" href="http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-24193078/stock-photo-shot-of-a-beautiful-girl-holding-gun.html">young lady</a> has an assault rifle.</p>
<p>There are also a lot of pictures of<a title="Shutterstock model" href="http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-38354473/stock-photo-skincare-of-young-beautiful-woman-face-with-fresh-flower-over-white-background.html"> attractive models</a> looking like they can’t wait to advertise your new cleanser.</p>
<p>Not that I could ever afford to buy pictures from <strong>Getty</strong>, but I checked them too.</p>
<p>*<a title="Getty search results for feminism" href="http://www.gettyimages.co.uk/Search/Search.aspx?contractUrl=2&amp;language=en-GB&amp;family=creative&amp;p=feminism&amp;assetType=image" target="_blank">ping!</a>*</p>
<p>Popular themes seem to be men and women glaring at each other in offices, arm wrestling and tugs-of-war (also in offices) and another disturbing <a title="Getty - guns in bed" href="http://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/sb10064861ab-001/Photodisc">guns-in-bed picture</a>.</p>
<p>Last stop:</p>
<h3>Creative Commons</h3>
<p>Firstly: I love Creative Commons; it basically makes my job possible (producing decent communications materials for charities). Y’all should<a title="Creative Commons - donate" href="https://creativecommons.net/donate/"> donate</a> to support them.</p>
<p>*<a title="Flickr CC search results for feminism" href="http://search.creativecommons.org/?q=feminism#" target="_blank">ping!</a>*</p>
<p><strong>Flickr</strong> is the main place I use for CC pics, and what comes up under ‘feminism’ is on the whole just pictures of the day-to-day business of it. Panel debates, speakers, meetings, marches, placards, some cool graffiti…</p>
<p>Not especially glamorous, but less weird and less violent than what stock photography sites seem to think goes on.  For example, I couldn’t find a single picture of a sexy bride in boxing gloves punching a businessman’s head off.</p>
