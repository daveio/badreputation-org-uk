										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8216;Men aren&#8217;t attentive to girls who wear glasses&#8217; is Marilyn Monroe&#8217;s sober pronouncement at the end of 1953&#8217;s classic <strong>How to Marry a Millionaire</strong>. As the myopic Pola, she&#8217;s spent the whole of the film whipping off her glasses as soon as she gets a whiff of aftershave.</p>
<p>&#8216;Honestly Pola, why can&#8217;t you keep those cheaters on long enough to see who you&#8217;re with?&#8217; asks exasperated gal pal Lauren Bacall, to which Pola replies:</p>
<p>&#8216;Oh no, I&#8217;m not taking a chance like that! You know what they say about girls who wear glasses.&#8217;</p>
<p>Apparently &#8211; according to a <a href="http://www.selectspecs.com/blog/the-sexy-librarian-look/">single and slightly biased internet source</a> &#8211; this wasn&#8217;t a million miles away from Monroe herself, who was &#8216;nearsighted and often wore glasses at times when she was out of the limelight&#8217;. If we believe this Fun Fact, its absence from the public domain underscores the irony. You know what they say about girls who wear glasses.</p>
<h3>Got To Put My Cheaters On!</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve got a lot of sympathy for poor Pola-Marilyn. I’ve had moderate to severe myopia since primary school, and spent a large portion of my teenage years bumping into things and hugging strangers out of a misguided desire to be considered attractive by the Average Teenage Boy.</p>

<p>To be fair, I am unluckily one of those people for whom glasses do not automatically provide a sense of <a href="http://www.spectaclesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/tom-ford-eyewear-girl-in-spectacles.jpg">insouciant high-end Tom Ford cool</a> &#8211; all the angles of my face are fattened and distorted with a bad pair of frames. And the laws of statistics and dubious teenage taste dictate that most longstanding myopics will choose a bad pair of frames several times over the course of their younger lives before alighting on the style that works for them. (I&#8217;ve always considered it very mean that the average glasses model can be selected for her <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--AyaO55wAIE/TZXLZUogRJI/AAAAAAAAAKk/ppfI9pDi8hQ/s1600/gokwan.jpeg">glasses-friendly angles</a>, whereas Real Life distributes myopia and astigmatism with no such aesthetic consideration. But lol fashion industry / real womenz / shocker.)</p>

<p>To bring the sob story towards a conclusion: I got contact lenses for my sixteenth birthday, wore them every hour of consciousness (to the long-term detriment of my ocular health), got a few erosions, corneal scars and whatnot due to excessive wear, finally accepted I needed a good pair of glasses and recently found the pair of frames I like with the help of a <a href="http://www.spexinthecity.com/">critical and dedicated sales assistant and a significant wad of cash</a>. I objectively like my glasses nowadays. But I still don&#8217;t wear them if I can help it.</p>
<p>Yes, I know. What.</p>
<h3>Eyes Wide Shut</h3>
<p>I have a literary precursor as far back as George Eliot, whose short-sighted Dorothea Brooke misses part of the plot of <strong>Middlemarch</strong>, by being ‘aware that there was a gentleman standing at a distance, but see[ing] him merely as a coated figure at a wide angle’. For Dorothea, the sights of Rome on her honeymoon are like &#8216;a disease of the retina&#8217;. <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080330174023AAKtsqW">On faut souffrir pour être belle</a>, non?</p>
<p>Indeed, you certainly don&#8217;t see many glasses on women pre-1950 or thereabouts, although they&#8217;ve <a href="http://myenvisioneyecare.wordpress.com/2010/08/04/interesting-eyewear-through-the-ages/#">been around for a while</a>. While part of this is undoubtedly an expense issue, pre-Nye Bevan and the <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/imgres?q=john+lennon&amp;num=10&amp;um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;biw=1130&amp;bih=615&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=h0haLXlnQczkzM:&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.johnlennon.com/&amp;docid=bWxLK1RkU-ggyM&amp;imgurl=http://www.johnlennon.com/wp-content/themes/jl/images/home-gallery/2.jpg&amp;w=1015&amp;h=1014&amp;ei=uYUDT-_QPIuA8gObtr2IBw&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=hc&amp;vpx=85&amp;vpy=162&amp;dur=271&amp;hovh=224&amp;hovw=225&amp;tx=94&amp;ty=125&amp;sig=118044106381756447403&amp;sqi=2&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=117&amp;tbnw=114&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=24&amp;ved=1t:429,r:0,s:0">NHS &#8216;John Lennon&#8217; frames</a>, and in the age of the Sherlock Holmesian &#8216;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventure_of_the_Golden_Pince-Nez">gold pince-nez</a>&#8216;, I think it was an aesthetic thing too. It&#8217;s significant that once bespectacled women start to appear in film and books they are generally working, or practical, women: <a href="http://www.wearysloth.com/Gallery/ActorsB/1262-20572.gif">Midge</a> in Hitchcock&#8217;s <strong>Vertigo</strong>, who is opposed to the mysterious Madeleine Elster, a lady of leisure; the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m11arA5LXGk">(sexy) secretary / librarian trope</a>; the Plain Jane in need of a makeover and the woman who’s really very intelligent but not very sexy – the one you have to really look at closely to realise &#8211; gosh! &#8211; she looks like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2_GpTWDL3o">Kate Winslet</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8216;Do you know? &#8211; without your glasses, you don&#8217;t look half bad.&#8217;<br />
&#8216;Do you know? &#8211; without my glasses, nor do you.&#8217;</p>
<p>Kate Winslet in <strong>Enigma</strong> (2001)</p></blockquote>
<p>These last are very much about glasses as a cover-up for something more exciting (whence, I assume, the provenance of the sexy secretary&#8217;s appeal). In another Marilyn Monroe film, <strong>The Seven Year Itch</strong>, the protagonist imagines his secretary throwing off her (tailored) jacket, throwing out her hair and losing the glasses, to reveal &#8216;I&#8217;m a woman! I&#8217;m flesh and blood!&#8217;. In much the same way, any unattractive high school social outcast has but to throw off their frames to reveal a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3r2Ih1-mVs">Rachel Leigh Cook</a> or an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUjlBP5gUrQ">Anne Hathaway</a>. Glasses, a synonym for intelligence and mystery, are the first things to discard when you want to seduce the hottest guy in school, trust.</p>

<p>Of course, the popularity of pre-makeover glasses &#8211; and their enduring use in teen films &#8211; is partly practical. Glasses are the easiest way to disguise a Hollywood beauty, and an instantly recognisable trope for your basic socially inept personality traits: &#8216;brains&#8217;, &#8216;practicality&#8217; etc. But as a teenager you’re inevitably subjected to a series of little humiliations and embarrassments that go on to dog you, to a greater or lesser extent, for a large part of your adult life. As a girl growing up behind a pair of glasses, and steeped in the standard adolescent amount of ideological nonsense, you cannot but associate all that tedious baggage (&#8216;I&#8217;m unattractive! I&#8217;m awkward! Nobody fancies me!&#8217;) with the teenage glasses, and shedding it with embracing contact lenses.</p>
<p>Indeed, it even seems to be a kind of ironic (and slightly obnoxious) appropriation of these ideas <a href="http://www.selectspecs.com/blog/get-your-glasses-on-for-valentine%E2%80%99s-day-%E2%80%93-specs-are-sexy/">when, conversely, glasses are deemed &#8216;sexy&#8217;</a> in themselves. One slightly palm-sweating blog in this vein compares them to garters &#8211; &#8216;men want to take them off [the woman wearing them]&#8217;, except more <a href="http://www.selectspecs.com/blog/the-sexy-librarian-look/"> fetishy</a>. Personally, I just wear them cos I like &#8230;seeing.</p>
<h3>Glasses-wearer By Day, Superhero By Night</h3>
<p>This is not just one for the girls &#8211; before he discovered the famous NHS frames, a very image-aware (but severely myopic) John Lennon refused to wear glasses when playing live, making him a Beatle who didn&#8217;t actually <em>see</em> the Cavern Club. But, by and large, men in glasses seem to have had an easier ride: the counterpart to the &#8216;sexy secretary&#8217; is, rather unfairly, the Clark Kent / Peter Parker paradigm, or rather, &#8216;glasses-wearer by day, superhero by night&#8217;. Compare this to the excellent typist who ditches the glasses only to show her employer that, actually, she <span style="text-decoration: underline;">does</span> enjoy sex (hmmm&#8230; enjoying sex / saving the world&#8230;).</p>
<p>Moreover, the weakness myopia is seen to connote in men is generally considered more attractive than the dowdiness it suggests in women &#8211; &#8216;You don&#8217;t think they make me look like an old maid?&#8217; worries Marilyn-Pola, through her Dame Ednas, as does Bette Davis pre-makeover in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6KD7DATyj0"><strong>Now, Voyager</strong></a> (1942) &#8211; and millionaire-seeking once again in <strong>Some Like It Hot</strong>, Marilyn hopes ‘her’ man will have glasses. ‘Men who wear glasses are so much more gentle, sweet and helpless’, she says. Indeed, there&#8217;s even a sense here that a man with glasses becomes less frightening or powerful, less brashly &#8216;male&#8217;. The only disadvantage for Marilyn is that when she kisses the one she finds, his glasses steam up.</p>
<p>But perhaps she has something when, in <strong>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes</strong> she asserts to her (bespectacled) groom’s disapproving father – who sees right through her gold-digging tricks &#8211; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9glKchxU3I&amp;t=5m30s">‘Don’t you know that a man being rich is like a woman being pretty? You wouldn’t marry a woman just because she’s pretty but, my goodness, doesn’t it help?!’</a>.  If a woman’s face is her fortune, best not to cover it with glasses, eh?</p>
<p>But actually, I think the time has come to take that as exactly the nonsense it is. Seeing is sexy. Wear your glasses with pride.</p>
