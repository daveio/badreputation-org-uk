					<description><![CDATA[Before we continue our series of horror-themed posts, we'd like to share the Women in Horror Month Mission statement.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re big into horror, feminism or both, you might already know that February is Women in Horror Recognition Month. </p>
<p>Sponsored by the US-based <a href="http://www.viscerafilmfestival.com/" target="_blank">Viscera Film Festival</a>, WiHM has really taken off <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/03/01/women-in-horror-five-recommended-writers/" target="_blank">since we covered it in 2011</a>, and we&#8217;re very proud to be WiHM Ambassadors &#8211; <a href="http://www.womeninhorrormonth.com/#!ambassadors" target="_blank">check us out on the list!</a> </p>
<p>We recently kicked off a set of posts on Women in Horror with <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2013/01/31/guest-post-author-maura-mchugh-recommends-more-women-in-horror-for-2013/" target="_blank">a return to our soapbox by Irish horror author Maura McHugh</a>, who returned to BadRep Towers to spotlights some women she admired working in the genre across a range of media.</p>
<p>Before we go further, though, we&#8217;d like to share the Women in Horror Month Mission statement.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2013/01/31/guest-post-author-maura-mchugh-recommends-more-women-in-horror-for-2013/womeninhorror2013logo/" rel="attachment wp-att-13088"><img data-attachment-id="13088" data-permalink="/2013/01/31/guest-post-author-maura-mchugh-recommends-more-women-in-horror-for-2013/womeninhorror2013logo/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/womeninhorror2013logo.jpg?fit=720%2C696&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="720,696" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="womeninhorror2013logo" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/womeninhorror2013logo.jpg?fit=300%2C290&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/womeninhorror2013logo.jpg?fit=720%2C696&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-13088" alt="womeninhorror2013logo" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/womeninhorror2013logo.jpg?resize=432%2C418" width="432" height="418" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/womeninhorror2013logo.jpg?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w, https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/womeninhorror2013logo.jpg?resize=300%2C290&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>This Mission Statement is taken from the <a href="http://www.womeninhorrormonth.com/" target="_blank">Women in Horror Recognition Month website</a>. They&#8217;ve asked that it be shared, quoted and spread about as much as possible, so we&#8217;re giving it the spotlight in itself for a moment, before we get down with our horror-nerdy selves in these pages. </p>
<p>***</p>
<h2>The Mission</h2>
<p>Women in Horror Recognition Month (WiHM) assists underrepresented female genre artists in gaining opportunities, exposure, and education through altruistic events, printed material, articles, interviews, and online support. WiHM seeks to expose and break down social constructs and miscommunication between female professionals while simultaneously educating the public about discrimination and how they can assist the female gender in reaching equality.</p>
<h2>The Vision</h2>
<p>A world in which all individuals are equally given the opportunity to create, share, and exploit their concept of life, pain, and freedom of expression.</p>
<h3>IT’S THE YEAR 2012, NOT THE 1950s. IS THERE REALLY A NEED FOR WiHM?</h3>
<p>Absolutely. Otherwise, WiHM would not exist. Women are still not offered the same pay and opportunities as their male colleagues in many industries, particularly the arts. Discrimination runs rampant in Hollywood and it&#8217;s very difficult for females (even well-known actresses) to get their films funded by major studios. </p>
<p>Statistics prove that women are still not offered the same opportunities as men due to an array of reasons, from discrimination to female professionals accepting less than they are worth in order to receive the same opportunities as their male colleagues.</p>
<p>In other parts of the world, women are still stoned to death for speaking their minds, excommunicated when they are sexually violated, and not offered proper education. Atrocities continue to happen that force the female gender to be subservient to a patriarchal system that tells them how to dress, who to marry, and what they should do with their lives. All discrimination must be exposed and obliterated for the female gender to truly achieve equality.</p>
<p>WiHM focuses on supporting the achievements of women who utilize the most extreme mirror available in storytelling: horror. We encourage women to explore and represent these horrors constructively, in positive environments.</p>
<h3>WHAT ARE THE INDUSTRY’S STATISTICS?</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the 1920s there were no more than 10 women working in Hollywood in leadership positions.</li>
<li>In 2009, the mainstream film industry’s ratio was 16% women to 84% men.</li>
<li>In 2011, women made up only 5% of directors working in Hollywood.</li>
<h3>SO WiHM IS ALL ABOUT WOMEN. WHAT ABOUT MEN?</h3>
<p>WiHM was created with no exclusion. Men play a vital part in the female gender reaching equality. There are many male WiHM Ambassadors and artists who choose to assist and work with professional and talented underrepresented female practitioners. Be a guiding example of a man who respects both genders equally.<sup><a href="/2013/02/17/women-in-horror-recognition-month-at-badrep-towers/#footnote_0_13152" id="identifier_0_13152" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" Ed&rsquo;s Tiny Note: Our team are in full support of this; given the diverse make-up of our own team&rsquo;s, we would likely expand this phrase where it occurs to &ldquo;all genders&rdquo; and &ldquo;all gender identities, presentations and expressions&rdquo;. ">1</a></sup></p>
<h3>WHAT CAN THE PUBLIC DO TO ASSIST WOMEN?</h3>
<p><strong>Personal Responsibility</strong></p>
<p>We all must take personal responsibility for our beliefs, values, and actions. Participating in positive, constructive environments that encourage and provide a safe platform for women to share and explore is vital.</p>
<p><strong>Education</strong></p>
<p>Education is essential. Knowledge is power. Understanding history and where that puts us today, politically and socially, demonstrates how we are interpreting each other and ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>Work with Women</strong></p>
<p>Finding professional women to work with in leadership positions is one of the most important actions you can take to assist the movement. Don’t just work with a woman because of her gender, work with her because she has a lot to bring to the table.</p>
<p><strong>Banish social constrictions</strong></p>
<p>Stereotyping, judging, cattiness, competitiveness, comparing, and gossip &#8211; all of these actions hurt men and women. We are all on our own path in life, careers, and personal relationships. We are encouraged to play into these cultural expectations when we are young, which can create judgment of those who are different. Stop it.</p>
<p><strong>Be a WiHM Ambassador</strong></p>
<p>Every February, WiHM Ambassadors host charity events (blood drives, film screenings, art shows), write blogs and articles, conduct interviews, and create videos and podcasts for mass consumption. All of these events and content specifically represent and assist the underrepresented female genre artist and are for philanthrpopic reasons only. No profit is made from WiHM, or the Viscera organization.</p>
<p><strong>Participate</strong></p>
<p>Go to the events, read the articles, watch the videos. Be conscious of the fact that you are consuming different perspectives of a movement that is assisting a struggle that women have experienced for at least the last four thousand years: equality. We have incredible potential right now to destroy discrimination. It deserves your attention.</p>
<p><strong>Donate</strong></p>
<p>Donate to WiHM. All funds go directly into the organization to improve the events, materials, and outreach. WiHM needs the support of the public.</p>
<p><strong>Support other organisations</strong></p>
<p>Organisations such as CARE, Women for Women International, RAINN, and WIF. All these organisations work hard all year round to assist women in achieving equality. Visit their websites and educate yourself.</p>
<h2>The Board</h2>
<p>The Board of Directors for WiHM is comprised of women from all facets of the horror film industry, including WiHM founder Hannah Forman, Debbie Rochon, Jovanka Vuckovic, Heidi Honeycutt, Jen and Sylvia Soska, and Shannon Lark.</p>
<h2>The Organisation</h2>
<p>WiHM is a service provided by the Viscera Organization, a 501(c)3 non profit organization expanding opportunities for contemporary female genre filmmakers and artists by raising awareness about the changing roles for women in the film industry.</p>

<p>In February 2010, Hannah Forman (under the pen name Hannah Neurotica) began <a href="http://www.womeninhorrormonth.com/"><strong>Women in Horror Recognition Month</strong></a> as a way to celebrate women&#8217;s contribution to the horror industry.</p>
<p>She began the campaign out of frustration at the lack of coverage of women working in horror media, and received a terrific response to the initiative. People used social media and blogging platforms to discuss their favourite women creators throughout the month of February, and aided the conversation about horror and women&#8217;s participation in it. It&#8217;s a fine example of how online communities can be harnessed to a positive effect. It&#8217;s become an annual event since then.</p>
<p>In the past four years there&#8217;s been a discernable increase of attention given to women&#8217;s contributions across the creative spectrum. This has not been given freely. It&#8217;s come about because women and men have asked to see a more equal representation of work by creators they enjoy. It&#8217;s because of campaigns liked Women in Horror Recognition Month that some media sources have finally noticed there <em>are</em> women in the industry, and that many of them have been around for a long time.</p>
<p>Hopefully there will come a time when such an initiative is redundant, but since the <a href="http://www.vidaweb.org/the-2011-count">Vida statistics</a> on the participation and coverage of women&#8217;s work in many media sources remains low, that time is not upon us yet.</p>
<p>Two years ago, Bad Reputation asked me to write an article called <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/03/01/women-in-horror-five-recommended-writers/"><strong>Women in Horror: Five Recommended Writers</strong></a>, and this year I&#8217;m singling out the work of women who create across horror media.</p>

She&#8217;s been making a reputation for herself in horror circles since her stories began to be published, from 2005 onwards. Her work has been printed and reprinted in many prestigious anthologies.</p>
<p>She writes difficult, fascinating characters coping with disturbing situations. Some of her stories are unashamedly erotic in a way that honestly reflects the terrible fixations of desire.</p>
<p>Her first short story collection, <strong>Engines of Desire: Tales of Love &amp; Other Horrors</strong>, was published by <a href="http://www.lethepressbooks.com/">Lethe Press</a> in 2011 and contains ten of her stories. It received rave reviews, and was nominated for a Shirley Jackson Award for Best Collection. It announced the arrival of an original talent, and one fans of horror fiction should watch.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.twistedtwinsproductions.net" target="_blank">Jen &amp; Slyvia Soska</a> are Canadian identical twins, long fans of horror, and have trained in martial arts and stunt work. Their first short film was a trailer for a movie, <a href="http://www.deadhookerinatrunk.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Dead Hooker in a Trunk</strong></a>, which they then made as their début film. They wrote, produced, directed, and acted in the movie, and it gained a lot of attention on the horror film festival circuit.</p>

<p>It was last year&#8217;s movie, <a href="http://www.twistedtwinsproductions.net/americanmary.htm" target="_blank"><strong>American Mary</strong></a>, which showed the development of the sisters&#8217; work. Once again they wrote, directed, and appeared in it. It stars Katharine Isabelle (<strong>Ginger Snaps</strong>) as Mary Mason, a broke medical student who changes her career after a traumatic experience, and puts her knowledge of physiology to use by doing extreme body modifications.</p>
<p>The film won five awards at Screamfest last year, including Best Picture and Best Director.</p>
<p>Over the years they&#8217;ve demonstrated determination, creative progression, and ambition, and I&#8217;m looking forward to what they will do next.</p>

<a href="http://alicelowe.net" target="_blank">Alice Lowe</a> attended Cambridge, and started her career co-devising and performing in small fringe shows. She appeared in <strong>Garth Marenghi&#8217;s Fright Knight</strong> in 2000 at the Edinburgh Festival. The show was nominated for the Perrier Award, and Alice won it the following year for her performance in the sequel, <strong>Garth Marenghi&#8217;s Netherhead</strong>. The show was then turned into a Channel 4 comedy, <a href="http://www.channel4.com/programmes/garth-marenghis-darkplace" target="_blank"><strong>Garth Marenghi&#8217;s Darkplace</strong></a>. Alice has also appeared in such television shows as <strong>The Mighty Boosh</strong>, <strong>Little Britain</strong>, and <strong>The IT Crowd</strong>.</p>
<p>She went back to Edinburgh Festival in 2005 with her own Kate-Bush inspired prog-rock spoof, <strong>Moonjourney</strong>, co-wrote and starred in Channel 4&#8217;s <strong>Orcadia</strong>, and was part of E4&#8217;s sketch show <strong>Beehive</strong>.</p>
<p>In 2010 she and director Jacqueline Wright set up Jackal Films to challenge themselves to create a short film every month, <a href="http://www.jackalfilms.co.uk/calendar/">which they did</a>. She also created <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01l22pk" target="_blank"><strong>Alice&#8217;s Wunderland</strong></a>, a<br />
comedy sketch show for BBC Radio 4.</p>
<p>Alice&#8217;s work focuses on comedy, but there are often dark veins of horror threaded throughout her material. A case in point is the film <strong>Sightseers</strong>, which was released in November 2012. She co-wrote it with Steve Oram, with some material by Amy Jump, and co-stars in the film with Oram. The film is a black comedy about a couple who go on holiday in a caravan and get up to a bit of murder along the way.</p>

You&#8217;ve studied Anglo-Irish supernatural fiction at university, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhartach">Abhartach</a> appears in <em>Róisín Dubh</em> and the ghost of Oscar Wilde turns up in your other comics project, <em>Jennifer Wilde</em>. Which other myths or historical figures can we expect to turn up in <em>Róisín Dubh</em>,  and do you have any favourite people, legends or mythological monsters from Irish history and folklore?</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Robert Curley at Atomic Diner comics pitched the core idea of <strong>Róisín Dubh</strong> to me and told me about the existing myth around Abhartach. I did what I  always do: research. I thought a great deal about the time period, the story of Abhartach, Róisín herself and her situation.</p>
<p>For me, I need to find what I think of a &#8216;mythic resonance&#8217; in a story that I&#8217;m trying to create. Making a character swing a sword and lop off a head is easy: making a story with horror and fantasy elements feel like it could possibly be real requires that it resemble mythology itself.</p>
<p>So, I went back to my books on Irish mythology &#8211; of which I have many  &#8211; and kept reading until elements connected with what I already had in  my head about the story. I added a few Irish gods into the mix, a  companion character and a couple of magical items. I widened the canvas. And I gave Róisín a very painful thing to do, which happens in issue 2 and is something that will haunt her forever. </p>
<p>Equally, I thought a lot about Abhartach. I don&#8217;t like simplistic villains. I added to his backstory and made him into a person who does unpleasant things, but who has motivations and reasons for his view of the world. Thankfully, Rob was very receptive to me bringing all this to the characters and the story!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been reading mythological stories from all cultures since childhood. One story that holds a lot of fascination for me is &#8216;the descent into the underworld&#8217;. There is a variation on that in issue 1 of <strong>Róisín Dubh</strong> &#8211; though I&#8217;m not always aware of every element like this that I&#8217;m tapping into when I write the story. Sometimes it doesn&#8217;t become obvious until later.</p>
<p>Ultimately, when writing I try to feed my subconscious to stuffing point with lots of influences and then allow it to serve me up suggestions as I&#8217;m going on. I trust it to give me the right element at the right time. Then, some time afterwards, I marvel at how it all came together. That&#8217;s when it&#8217;s really doing its job.</p>
<p>But I have days when it gives me nothing and I soldier on anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Creating a comic book in this way, with a separate writer  and artist, is a collaborative process, and one that tends to be favoured by most American and European publishers. How did this process work for you, how much input did the artists have, and what was it like seeing your character come to life in their hands?</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;The collaborative element is what I enjoy the most. I can&#8217;t tell you how amazing it is to see the words I&#8217;ve written translated into images. Mostly, it&#8217;s better than I hoped.  Sometimes we&#8217;ll discuss how a certain panel is working and ask for changes.</p>
<p>No one is going to draw the Róisín in my head unless I do &#8211; so I have  to allow the artists to bring their version of her to the page.  A successful comic book collaboration &#8211; in my experience &#8211; is about respecting the strengths each person brings to the project. The writer understands story dynamics and the artist knows visual storytelling. You have to learn to depend on the other person&#8217;s knowledge and experience to guide changes in the comic book.</p>
<p>Also, you have to be open to seeing things from a different perspective, and accepting change. I&#8217;m always happy when the artist makes suggestions that are innovative and work better than my original concept.  We&#8217;re all pulling together for the same goal: to create a comic book people will enjoy.&#8221;</p>

You&#8217;re a busy woman! Why don&#8217;t you tell  us a bit more about the projects you&#8217;re working on at the moment besides <em>Róisín Dubh</em>?</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://jenniferwildecomic.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Jennifer Wilde</strong></a> is a fun project. Again, Robert Curley came to me with the core idea, and I went off and did my research &#8211; and that was just brilliant. The 1920s was an amazing era of change: social, economic, and cultural. The story is lighter, and more in the detective genre &#8211; albeit with a  supernatural element.  Jennifer is a French artist who &#8211; through personal  tragedy &#8211; becomes embroiled in a mystery that takes her from France, to England and finally to Ireland &#8211; all helped by the ghost of Oscar Wilde.</p>
<p>Writing Wilde is the most intimidating aspect of the project. I&#8217;ve done a lot of research on him, and he was a brilliant, complex man, but not always wonderful. I try to be respectful of who he was and to bring as much of that to the project as possible.</p>
<p>Most of the art is complete on issue 1, and it should be out in about six weeks. Our artist Stephen Downey has done a fantastic job.  I&#8217;m currently working on the scripts for issue 2 and 3. Issue 2 of <strong>Róisín Dubh</strong> is in the editing stage at the moment, so that should be good to go soon enough.</p>
<p>I usually have other projects in the sidelines, in various stages of  completion: non-fiction, screenplays short stories, poetry, a novel. I even have an idea for a comic book strip, which I would draw as well as write. These projects go up and down in priority depending on deadlines.</p>
<p>All things going well, I&#8217;ll probably write another volume of <strong>Róisín Dubh</strong> and <strong>Jennifer Wilde</strong> for <a href="http://www.atomicdiner.com/">Atomic Diner</a>. I&#8217;d also like to create and write my own comic book series. I have several stories in development.</p>
<p>As well as this I have my job with the Irish Playwrights&#8217; and Screenwriters&#8217; Guild as their blogger and website-wrangler.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s good to be busy!&#8221;</p>

To get us started, why don&#8217;t you tell us a bit about <em>Róisín Dubh </em>, which has just gone on release.</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://roisindubhcomic.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Róisín Dubh</strong></a> is a three-issue comic book series that will also be collected and bound as a graphic novel. It&#8217;s set in Ireland in 1899 and follows the adventures of Róisín Sheridan, an eighteen-year-old woman who harbours ambitions to be an actress. Her life is altered forever when she and her parents are attacked on the road by a bloodthirsty man called Abhartach who has just risen from the earth. Róisín&#8217;s parents are killed and she is left for dead&#8230; until she is given a mission by ancient powers. She has to go against the conventions of the day, and her previous notions of what is possible, to try and put Abhartach back in the ground&#8230; but the person who raised Abhartach from his 1,400-year stasis has other plans.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>What might feminist readers enjoy about the comic? As if an Irish suffragette killing demons isn&#8217;t enough to get anyone interested&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I hope there&#8217;s plenty there for everyone, but the women&#8217;s suffrage movement was on my mind from the start. Róisín has had a liberal, educated upbringing, she was allowed a lot of leeway as a child, but as a woman she&#8217;s starting to discover that there are more limits on her than she imagined.</p>
<p>For instance, that simple thing her father says to her: <a href="http://roisindubhcomic.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/rd1-1-3new1.jpg"><em>of course women should have the right to vote&#8230; but a career on the stage? It&#8217;s disreputable.</em> </a>The struggle for equal rights is a slow erosion of the <em>but</em>s. People are always full of reasons why you can have some rights, but not all.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why Róisín has a bike. People forget that the bicycle was a huge boon to women in the nineteenth century &#8211; it gave them a freedom of movement that they didn&#8217;t enjoy previously, and it also helped bring about a change in clothing.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_B._Anthony">Susan B. Anthony</a> said in 1896 that she thought the bicycle &#8216;has done more to emancipate women than anything else in the world, It gives a woman a feeling of freedom and self-reliance. The moment she takes her seat she knows she can&#8217;t get into harm unless she gets off her bicycle, and away she goes, the picture of free, untrammeled womanhood.'&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>What sort of heroine is Róisín &#8211; who is she as a character? Which other comic book heroines have inspired you in the past and what do you like about them?</strong></p>

The events in the comic book means she&#8217;s forced to deal with tragedy while learning she has far less control over her life. These are the kinds of lessons we often learn in life, although in Róisín&#8217;s case they involve an undead creature, magicians and ancient Irish divinities!</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t drawn upon any other comic book heroines consciously in relation to Róisín, but there were a number that had an impact upon me over the years. First was Judge Anderson in <strong>2000 AD</strong>. I didn&#8217;t read many American comics when I was growing up in Ireland as there weren&#8217;t many available at the time. <strong>2000 AD</strong> was the premiere title for young teens then, so I read it too. Her first appearance in the Judge Death storyline (written by John Wagner and drawn by Brian Bolland) ticked all the boxes for me: horror and a great female lead.</p>
<p>What I loved about Anderson was her humour. She was the only one who poked fun at Dredd, and I loved that the Psi-Division were given loads of leeway because of the job they did and the high risk of their brains being fried in the process. Plus, she saves the world through an extreme act of self-sacrifice (thankfully, she didn&#8217;t remain in stasis forever!).</p>
<p>A while ago I read a comment on a website by one of the early artists of Anderson, in which he said he thought that she wasn&#8217;t very complex and was created for a bit of titillation for the lads. That comment disappointed me greatly. I guess he didn&#8217;t realise that Anderson was one of the <em>very few</em> women in <strong>2000 AD</strong> at the time, and for that reason alone she had a big impact on the girls/women who read the series. Having a representation of women in comics book series is really important, and Dredd himself is not exactly the most complex character! I don&#8217;t usually hanker after writing particular characters, but writing Anderson would be a dream project.</p>
<p>Another character that had a big impact was <strong>Tank Girl</strong> (Jamie Hewlett and Alan Martin). She had a punk sensibility and a sense of humour, and liked sex, drugs and driving a tank &#8211; what was not to love?</p>
<p>Other characters I like are David Mack&#8217;s <strong>Scarab</strong>, <strong>Storm</strong> from the <strong>X-Men</strong> (woefully underused, I think), Alan Moore&#8217;s <strong>Halo Jones</strong> (another character I&#8217;d kill to write) and <strong>Promethea</strong>, Warren Ellis&#8217;s <strong>Jenny Sparks</strong>, and finally, the goddess herself, <strong>Wonder Woman</strong>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve only fallen in love with the Wonder Woman character in the past year, which is completely the result of <strong>Gail Simone</strong>&#8216;s amazing writing. I&#8217;m also now a big fan of Simone&#8217;s <strong>Secret Six</strong> and <strong>Birds of Prey</strong> &#8211; so you can include all the (many) female characters in those series on my list now. Simone is one of the best comic book writers in the industry in my opinion, and she&#8217;s particularly adept at dialogue, especially for the female characters. Her comic books consistently pass the <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2005/10/16/badrepwiki-the-bechdel-test/">Bechdel Test</a>, which so many titles still don&#8217;t do.&#8221;</p>

What have you learned from this so far, and has it ever worked against you?</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;No change occurs if you remain silent. It&#8217;s that simple &#8211; but it&#8217;s not necessarily easy to speak up.</p>
<p>As a woman you know a likely response to raising an issue &#8211; such as the lack of women at an event &#8211; is that you will be dismissed or attacked (especially on the Internet).</p>
<p>So, I always strive to be fair and logical in how I present my case. Sometimes that&#8217;s difficult because I feel so passionately about women getting a fair shake &#8211; well, everyone getting a fair shake, no matter their gender, ethnicity, sexuality, etc.</p>
<p>A number of people have asked me if I think I&#8217;m damaging my career with some of the issues I&#8217;ve raised. So far I&#8217;ve never experienced it, but would it stop me? No.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s be realistic. I&#8217;m speaking out on issues from a pretty safe environment. If I was a female union representative in Mexico &#8211; for example &#8211; I would have a genuine risk in speaking up. Or a mother trying to access education for her girls in Afghanistan. Those people inspire me &#8211; they are taking real risks with their lives and yet find the courage to stand up for what is right.</p>
<p>When I think of that it puts what I do in perspective! (And it makes me donate to aid organisations that help people in those risky situations.)&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Come back tomorrow for Part 2 of our interview. Warm thanks to Maura for talking to us.</strong></p>

<p>If you like scary stories and those who create them, you might be interested to know that February was <a href="http://womeninhorrormonth.com/"><strong>Women in Horror Recognition Month</strong></a>. This is the second year of the initiative, which was started by <a href="http://hannahneurotica.com/">Hannah Neurotica</a> out of frustration because of the often-repeated myth that &#8216;there are no women creating horror&#8217;.</p>
<p>While women participate in the horror industry (literature, films, comic books, video games, etc) in fewer numbers than men, they are not absent. Many of them have been working in the field for a very long time, and have considerable credentials. Yet somehow they are rarely remembered and people scratch their heads when trying to recollect their names.</p>
<p>Where women are featured in horror events or magazines there is often an over-emphasis on actresses (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scream_queen">Scream Queens</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_girl">Last Girls</a>) rather than the novelists, screenwriters or directors who are also involved in the field. No doubt this is due to two factors: an over-abundance of male journalists who want to meet their favourite actress, and the usual cultural bias that stresses the value of a woman&#8217;s appearance over the strength of her other talents.</p>
<p>No one dismisses the importance of actresses, since <a href="http://splinister.com/post/miss-representation">women are under-represented in film and television</a> anyway, but women and men deserve more exposure to the variety of work that women accomplish in the field.</p>
<p>Need recommendations?</p>
<p>Here are five of the current crop of female horror writers who are well worth reading.</p>

<h3><a href="http://miragrant.com/">USA: Mira Grant</a></h3>

<p>It&#8217;s difficult to pick five out of such a talented field, so I feel obliged to list a number of other writers people should read: <strong>Lisa Morton</strong>, <strong>Margo Lanagan</strong>, <strong>Tananarive Due</strong>, <strong>Caitlin R Kiernan</strong>, <strong>Sara Gen</strong>, <strong>Lisa Tuttle</strong>, <strong>Kathe Koja</strong>, <strong>Joyce Carol Oates</strong>, <strong>Nancy Holder</strong>, <strong>Catherynne M Valente</strong>, <strong>Holly Black</strong>, <strong>Yvonne Navarro</strong>, <strong>Lisa Mannetti</strong>, <strong>Tanith Lee</strong>, <strong>Lucy Snyder</strong>, <strong>Marjorie Liu</strong>, <strong>M Rickert</strong>, <strong>Mary SanGiovanni</strong>, <strong>Pat Cadigan</strong>, <strong>Melanie Tem</strong> and <strong>Helen Oyeyemi</strong>.</p>
<p>We should also give a hat-tip to a representation of the women editors (some of whom are also writers) in horror, such as <strong>Ellen Datlow</strong> (Darkness: Two Decades of Modern Horror, Best Horror of the Year 2), <strong>Ann VanderMeer </strong>(Weird Tales), <strong>Heidi Martinuzzi</strong> (editor-in-chief of FanGirlTastic.com), <strong>Barbara Roden</strong> (All Hallows, At Ease with the Dead, co-edited with Christopher Roden), <strong>Paula Guran</strong> (Year&#8217;s Best Dark Fantasy and Horror), <strong>Nancy Kilpatrick</strong> (Evolve, Outsiders), <strong>Monica S Kuelber</strong> (Rue Morgue), <strong>Christine Makepeace</strong> (Paracinema) and <strong>Angela Challis</strong> (Australian Dark Fantasy &#038; Horror).</p>
<p>This is just a small sample of the talented women who are writing and editing horror. There are far more, with new writers breaking into the field every day. I take it as a good sign that <a href="http://www.horror.org/news-2010stokerprelim.htm">this year&#8217;s longlist for the <strong>Bram Stoker Awards</strong></a> included a more diverse list of writers and editors.</p>
<p>Of course, there are also many supportive men in the industry who have published women and promoted their inclusion.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s hope in a few years there will be no need for Women in Horror Recognition Month. For the moment, however, it&#8217;s a necessary reminder to strive for a better representation of the diversity of voices in the horror business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>RIVETING NEWS: BadRep Towers is changing its ISP! This means the internet connection may be a bit ropey for the editor! So we&#8217;re hoping to have a post a day like we normally do, but hold on to your hats if we don&#8217;t quite hit our schedule this week. On to the links!</p>
<ul>
<li>A few weeks ago, but for anyone who&#8217;s not seen it: The <strong>New York Times</strong> features <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/31/business/media/31link.html?_r=2&amp;smid=tw-nytimes">an article on the gender disparity in wikipedia editors</a>.</li>
<li>Linked to by commenter Ian on <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/01/20/five-pirate-women-from-the-pages-of-history-number-one-lady-killigrew/">our first Pirate Women of History post</a>, <a href="http://www.lothene.org/others/women.html">this page is from a reenactment site, but <strong>basically quite a good pile of historical info, links and lists about women in martial leadership through history</strong></a>. Also relevant for anyone unpersuaded by the arguments in the recent <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/01/19/assassins-creed-the-frank-miller-effect-strikes-again/">Assassin&#8217;s Creed debate</a> about Activities An Independently-Minded Female Character Can Be Doing In A Period Setting Apart From Sex Work (Which Is Fine, But Not The Only Available Activity For A Scriptwriter). And WHERE IS THE NEXT PIRATE POST, I hear you cry? PANIC NOT, DEAR READERS. It&#8217;s in the works.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s <strong>Women in Horror Recognition Month</strong>, if you didn&#8217;t know.  Stuck to name many women authors and directors working in the horror genre that aren&#8217;t male?  It&#8217;s not for lack of women, that&#8217;s for sure, and you can discover many of them at Melissa Helwig&#8217;s <a href="http://littlemisszombie.blogspot.com/">Little Miss Zombie blog</a>, <a href="http://splinister.com/post/bloody-women">Maura McHugh&#8217;s blog on Splinister.com</a>, and Re/Action magazine editor <a href="http://sarahdobbs.wordpress.com/">Sarah Dobb&#8217;s blog</a>.</li>
<li>And while BadRep struggles through a storm of BT Line Rental Negotiations to hold on to its Internet Connection Hat, <a href="http://reactionblog.tumblr.com/buy_now">why not order your copy of <strong>Re/Action magazine</strong>, issue 2</a> (check out the rockin&#8217; cover). We&#8217;ve stocked up on our reading materials for the internet drought; drought or no drought you should check it out anyway. Good stuff.</li>
<li><strong>Salon</strong> sums it up: <a href="http://www.salon.com/entertainment/tv/feature/2011/02/15/lara_logan_rape_reaction">What Not To Say About Lara Logan.</a> <em>(Discusses sexual assault.)</em></li>
<li>Meanwhile,<strong> Eulogy</strong> magazine <a href="http://www.eulogymagazine.co.uk/article/ofinterest/detail/id/89">are covering LGBT History Month</a> &#8211; from the point of view of a magazine themed around death, but good to see it on there.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.emcarroll.com/comics/anu/page01.html" target="_blank"><strong>Em Carroll</strong> has drawn a short, beautiful comic for Valentine&#8217;s season</a>.</li>
<li>Do you play computer games? Then hopefully some of the refrains on  <a href="http://fatuglyorslutty.com/"><strong>Fat, Ugly or Slutty</strong></a> won&#8217;t have happened to you! They say: <em>Some players like to send creepy, disturbing, insulting, degrading  and/or just plain rude messages to other online players, usually women. We think this is funny.</em> Could be triggering for some, but it&#8217;s a nice demonstration of solidarity. And here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.fragdolls.com/index.php/blogs/detail/category/rhoulette/a_picture_is_worth_a_thousand_shouted_words">an article about the creation of the site</a>.</li>
