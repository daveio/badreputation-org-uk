										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.sinfest.net/"><strong>Sinfest</strong></a> is one of my favourite webcomics. I can&#8217;t quite work out why I haven&#8217;t written it up as a Found Feminism before, I guess I just made the assumption that like kittens with captions, everyone already knew about it. The strip has been going for a while, and I love the mix of anti-dinner table talk  (politics, sex and religion) with the more winsome or just for gags strips.  It&#8217;s updated pretty regularly and has a massive archive so I&#8217;ve just fixed that question over what you are going to do for the next week &#8211; go read!</p>

<p>On the face of it, a drugs-and-porn fuelled pig, bikini devil girls and a lead female character who talks a lot about clothes and boys doesn&#8217;t seem like an instant win for Team Bad Rep &#8211; but appearances can be deceptive.</p>
<p>Monique (with the awesome purple hair) is a revolutionary and a style guru, whilst still being a well-rounded character. Proving, if more proof were needed &#8211; and it sometimes is &#8211; that feminism isn&#8217;t about wearing dungarees and being angry all the time. It&#8217;s a thing that people do, to make other people&#8217;s lives better. And it can be light-hearted, well meaning, serious AND funny. With amazing hair.</p>
<p><strong>Sinfest</strong> is written and drawn by <strong>Tatsuya Ishida</strong>, a Japanese American writer/artist who takes pop culture references and uses them to make some really good points about gender politics and <a href="http://www.sinfest.net/archive_page.php?comicID=2966">American consumer culture</a> and mashes them up into a great read. I distinctly remember following the strip more closely than the American election, especially because Sarah Palin Pig made me cry with laughter. The artwork is wonderful, with some lovely bits of line art. He also does some cute dog and cat jokes as well as some <a href="http://www.sinfest.net/archive_page.php?comicID=3411">beautiful calligraphy word-to-shape panels</a>. There really is very little not to like.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve really pulled out all the stops with the recent <a href="http://www.sinfest.net/archive_page.php?comicID=4051">Patriarchy</a> series, which neatly uses the idea of the Matrix to describe living in the &#8220;patriarchy&#8221; &#8211; I&#8217;m going to print out copies and hand them out to anyone who asks what this feminism malarky is all about.</p>
