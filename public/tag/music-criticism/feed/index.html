										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There were several predictable bones to pick with last week’s <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/feb/26/nme-60-editors-favourite-covers"><strong>Guardian</strong> piece</a> in which former editors of the <strong>New Musical Express</strong> selected their most noteworthy covers. The feature left out a lot of the former <strong>Accordion Weekly</strong>’s history, notably anything prior to the late 1970s, but what struck me most about the covers chosen was the disparity between the first one and the last. The <strong>NME</strong>&#8216;s <a href="http://velvetcoalmine.wordpress.com/2009/04/17/sleeping-with-the-nme-how-the-british-music-press-picked-up-a-dose-of-the-crap/">decline</a> from a vital and thoughtful read to a list-heavy vehicle for mutual backscratching seemed to be reflected in the journey from Pennie Smith&#8217;s 1979 cover shot of the Slits, then a relatively obscure and resolutely uncommercial dub-punk girl-gang, dressed in mud and loincloths, to, thirty years on, a cover featuring the monarch of manufactured mediocrity <a href="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/2/24/1330114355043/NME-covers---Simon-Cowell-002.jpg">in a headshot</a> which, to quote a commenter, makes the paper look like the <strong>Radio Times</strong>.</p>
<p>Smith’s photographs of the Slits mudlarking in the grounds of their Surrey recording studio became a defining image of the band, notably through being used on the cover of their debut album <strong>Cut</strong>. This article looks briefly at the controversy generated by the images themselves, and how it relates to subsequent and current presentation of women in the UK music press.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/NME-covers-The-Slits-001.jpg?resize=460%2C654" alt="Image copyright Pennie Smith/the NME, shared under Fair Use guidelines. A black and white image showing The Slits swinging from trees smeared with mud." width="460" height="654" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h3>Under the Cover</h3>
<p>The space provided by punk for female as well as well as male self-expression and emancipation can be overstated – see Helen Reddington’s <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=l5l4PiOfYTcC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=helen%20reddington%20lost%20women%20rock&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=helen%20reddington%20lost%20women%20rock&amp;f=false">research</a> on the persistence of entrenched chauvinist and sexist attitudes – but the Slits were unarguably, in the words of Caroline Coon, ‘driving a coach and various guitars straight through&#8230; the concept of The Family and female domesticity’. One of the first prominent bands to spring from the art-squats of punk west London, the Slits’ early music and performance was a squall of untrained, instinctive energy, and their casually confrontational appearance and behavior drew negative reactions ranging from media disapproval to violent hostility. Although tending to recoil from any overtly political espousal of feminism, the band bluntly advocated female independence and empowerment, encouraging girls to form bands and to define themselves by their actions rather than their relationships.</p>
<blockquote><p>‘We’re just not interested in questions about Women’s Liberation&#8230; You either think chauvinism’s shit or you don’t. We think it’s shit&#8230; Girls shouldn’t hang around with people who give them aggro about what they want to do. If they do they’re idiots.’<br />
&#8211; <strong><a href="http://www.punk77.co.uk/graphics/slits/carolinecoonpage4.jpg">Slits guitarist Viv Albertine, June 1977</a></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The image on the <strong>Cut</strong> cover fits into the Slits’ more general disruptions and subversions of accepted feminine tropes, including their punk-inspired adoption of fetish and bondage gear as deconstructed parts of an everyday wardrobe, and their plain-speaking on sex and sexuality. The band’s proto-Goth contemporary Siouxsie Sioux remarked that they &#8216;weren&#8217;t glamorous, they were very earthy&#8217;. The Slits’ aesthetic and behaviour onstage and off was repeatedly referenced in terms of wildness and ferocity, reinforcing their performance of an exoticised, &#8216;untamed&#8217; sexuality, which on the album cover clashed with the band’s bucolic backdrop to create an arresting mash-up of English Rose and Amazon.</p>
<h3>Covered in Controversy</h3>
<p>Having in their earlier career declined several offers from labels intent on exploiting the novelty aspect of a girl band, and battled with industry men who expected female musicians to ‘kowtow or flutter your eyelids’, the band’s stated aim for the cover of their debut was to &#8216;show that women could be sexy without dressing in a prescribed way. Sexy, in a natural way, and naked, without being pornographic&#8217;. Their bassist Tessa Pollitt described the cover as ‘one of the most liberating things I have done’, claiming that the band were ‘celebrating the freedoms we were creating’. The cover divided opinion at the time of its release, dismissed by some as a cynically sexualized ploy, and ridiculed by others because of the group’s deviation from a conventionally desirable body shape (Smith’s photographs were taken at a point when the Slits had succumbed to the regular eating and sleeping hours of studio life, away from the chaotic amphetamine-fuelled living to which they’d grown accustomed, leaving them looking softer and more rounded than expected by those policing punk angularity &#8211; a particularly frustrating slant of attack given punk’s early attempts to transcend these kind of prescriptive aesthetics).</p>
<p>Music writer Vivien Goldman embraced the <strong>Cut</strong> cover as a defiant reclamation of the female body, and Pauline Black, who went on to form 2-Tone band the Selecter, saw it as ‘so joyous, innocent and natural that it just seemed like a celebration of womanhood rather than any cheap titillation’. It still has the power to spark disagreement: Roni Sarig in <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29050.The_Secret_History_of_Rock"><strong>The Secret History Of Rock</strong></a> waxes lyrical that the cover ‘confounded notions of sexuality and civility and positioned the group as modern primitive feminist rebels &#8211; girls not afraid to be natural, sexual and formidable’, while the author of the <a href="http://www.punk77.co.uk/groups/slitsdiscography.htm">Punk77</a> website makes the counter-claim that the image in fact undermines Sarig’s idea ‘that they were one of the first all female bands to avoid being &#8216;marketed as sex objects&#8217;&#8230; They had their tits out. For instance I was 16 when this album came out&#8230; I and many others didn&#8217;t see it as anything but three nudes on a cover!’</p>
<h3>Bad Cover Versions</h3>
<p>As for the women-in-the-music-press discussion, so far so same-old. Cazz Blase&#8217;s <a href="http://www.thefword.org.uk/features/2012/02/women_and_the_music_press">recent article</a> on the UK music press maintained that it is marketed, sold and created primarily by and for men. The <strong>NME</strong>, which in 2009 appointed Krissi Murison as its first female editor, is actually not too bad as far as the balance of genders among its staff goes &#8211; although the relative positions women occupy, and how this translates to coverage and presentation of female musicians, are different debates. In 2010, Aoife Barry gave <a href="http://www.theantiroom.com/2010/11/16/what-the-boys-said-gender-imbalance-in-music-magazines/">an overview</a> of the underrepresentation of female musicians on the covers of music magazines, emphasizing the egregiousness of Q in particular:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why not count how many women you can see on the covers of <strong>Q</strong> magazine this year (two solo covers: Cheryl Cole and Lady Gaga – and two group shots: Amy Winehouse and Lily Allen together in a group shot; and Lady Gaga again in a group shot). The reason I mention <strong>Q</strong> is that the response to ‘there aren’t enough women on the covers of music magazines’ is often ‘but that’s because it reflects the amount of women working in music&#8217;. This is not true – particularly in the case of <strong>Q</strong>, which covers mainstream rock, indie and pop music. In fact, the female musicians it covers are usually from the pop arena. And you cannot argue that the pop realm is oestrogen-free.</p></blockquote>
<p>While, as Barry admits, ‘there may not be a great conspiracy to keep women off the covers of music magazines and give them minimal coverage on the inside pages’, it is frequently the case that when women are featured, so is a latent or overt sexualizing of them which does not affect their male counterparts to the same degree.</p>
<p>One has to factor in, of course, the degree to which coverage of bands will depend upon commercial trends in rock and indie; the musical greywash which occurred under late Britpop saw a sidelining of female artists which appeared to reach its dull conclusion in the post-Libertines profusion of almost invariably male ‘landfill indie’ groups. This connection is made explicit in <strong>Q</strong>’s concern with catering for a target demographic supposedly ‘inspired by the rock&#8217;n&#8217;roll swagger of Liam, Noel, Blur and the whole Britpop scene’, a remit which perhaps explains last October’s <a href="http://covers.q4music.com/Item.aspx?pageNo=6179&amp;year=2011">gobsmackingly retrograde</a> Kasabian cover while doing little to excuse it.</p>
<h3>Covering Up?</h3>
<p>Smith’s shot of the Slits in all their unphotoshopped glory differs from <strong>Q</strong>&#8216;s cover in several obvious respects – its subjects muddy rather than glossy, wearing unselfconscious grins rather than careful high-maintenance pouts, and, crucially, having shaped the image via their own concept and direction rather than following a top-down marketing or editorial strategy. It’s true that the NME has never been an impregnable bastion of women&#8217;s liberation – even on that Slits cover, there’s the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_Three">dubious </a>strapline referring to them as the paper’s ‘Page One girls’ – and I&#8217;m sure that just as many readers saw the cover as wank material as chin-strokingly believed it to be &#8216;confounding notions of sexuality and civility&#8217;. A happy few may even have done both. But the upfront disheveled self-confidence the Slits display is still striking and even looks quaint in an era where the last comparable Empowered and Liberated woman on an <strong>NME</strong> cover was, who, Beth Ditto? Whose appearance, and the ensuing <a href="http://www.bigfatblog.com/beth-ditto-cover-nme">debates</a> on whether it constituted &#8217;empowerment&#8217; or &#8216;objectification&#8217;, proved that non-standard naked women were still controversial in 2007.</p>
<p>Cazz Blaze, citing the music press’ recession-induced drift towards conservatism, characterized by an increasing reliance on sponsorship and advertising, predicts little room for improvement in opportunities for women to express their emancipation rather than their objectification. Her characterization of online music publications like <a href="http://thequietus.com/">The Quietus</a> as more conscientious about women as artists, readers, and writers, is an interesting point. It ties in with the idea of the internet as a space where female engagement with music can be expressed and explored without being dismissed as exclusively sex-centred or derided as juvenile inanity, and where female musicians themselves can harness the internet’s capacity for unregulated self-expression and audience interaction, <a href="http://wearsthetrousers.com/2008/11/outraged-amanda-palmer-fans-mount-rebellyon/">frequently</a> in ways which circumvent or combat industry and media-led imperatives on how women are meant to appear.</p>
<p>Despite the internet’s progressive potential for allowing female artists control over their own presentation, the reception of and reaction to that presentation remains beyond their control. After punk, and after riot grrl, the jury is still out on the political uses of the naked female form, and on their degree of effectiveness. Do images like those of Ditto and the Slits deconstruct and demystify the female body? How constructively do they inform debates on body image and female sexuality? In the eyes of observers male and female, are they validating alternative ways of being attractive, or are they merely putting forward an alternative cut of meat?</p>
<p>And, of course, should we be concerned at all with how a musician looks as opposed to how she &#8211; or he &#8211; sounds?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/01/25/women-men-and-music-the-xy-factor-part-1/">Part One</a> of this  article identified a split in approaches to music between the intellectual and abstract and the personal  and emotive. This is, of course, a false dichotomy, as is the concomitant  view of the former approach as a male preserve and the latter a female  one. It&#8217;s not like emotional engagement can&#8217;t be channelled into sharp and intelligent critique. And  it’s not like girls are incapable of dry and po-faced analysis (an album  review of mine once received the amusingly disgruntled response &#8220;I bet  you write for <strong>The Wire</strong>, you pretentious cunt&#8221;. I mean, chance would be a  fine thing). Neither are male writers incapable of experiencing or  articulating an emotional reaction. Gender has no intrinsic &#8211; as opposed to socially and culturally  instilled &#8211; effect on how an individual engages with music. But the effects of cultural conditioning in creating this false dichotomy, and the degree to which ‘male’ ways  of music writing are privileged &#8211; the existence of what Everett True describes as <a href="http://www.collapseboard.com/sexism-etc-excerpt-from-an-email-to-the-editor-of-mess-and-noise" target="_blank">a dominant male hive mind</a> &#8211; goes some way towards explaining why female music writers are so scarce in the mainstream press.</p>
<p>Music criticism as presently constructed has an undeniable tendency to discourage female participation. Sarah Barnes <a href="http://www.upliftmagazine.com/uplift/2009/02/frances-morgan-of-plan-b-talks-women-in-music-journalism" target="_blank">recalls</a> that when writing her first album review:</p>
<blockquote><p>I  felt out of my depth, because my experiences of music reviewing told me  that what I wrote had to be very technical, almost cold. All that  technical knowledge seemed very male, and I think I had picked up on  this as a pre-requisite in music criticism from reading copies of  <strong>Kerrang</strong> &#8230; or listening to my boyfriend  reeling off genres and sub-genres until my head starts spinning.</p></blockquote>
<p>More recently, Aoife Barry’s study of <a href="http://theantiroom.wordpress.com/2010/11/16/what-the-boys-said-gender-imbalance-in-music-magazines/" target="_blank">gender imbalance in music magazines</a> compares reading The Wire to ‘<em>poring  over academic texts in an attempt to formulate an answer for an essay  due the next day; the feeling that out of the dry sentences I have to  pull something tangible that makes sense to me’</em>.</p>

<p>The  masculinist bent of mainstream music criticism has seen certain forms  of engagement with music &#8211; attention to the emotional, the  pleasure-seeking, the glittery, the silly, the frivolous, the undeadly serious &#8211;  conceptualised as less deserving concerns, and downgraded  accordingly, along with musical genres &#8211; pop, glam, disco &#8211; which are  seen as primarily catering to these concerns. So in order to be taken  seriously, to do ‘proper’ criticism, one must elevate cerebral,  scholarly Pure Music and implicitly disparage the dizzy, gushing immediacy of the  personal Applied. Better a nitpicking Hornbyite geek than a groupie,  regardless of the degree to which these categories can and do overlap in  the same individual.</p>
<p>However nebulous or subconscious this construction  may be, it ties in unhelpfully with rock-solid <a href="http://rincewindsw.blogspot.com/2010/08/sexism-in-music-journalism.html" target="_blank">sexism and gender imbalance</a> within the media and the music industry to reinforce both the image and  reality of music writing as a boys’ club. As <a href="http://noorigin.wordpress.com/2010/12/04/sexism-in-music-journalism/">this excellent overview</a> explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>Periodicals  like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone"><strong>Rolling Stone</strong></a> and websites like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitchfork_Media"><strong>Pitchfork Media</strong></a> &#8211; which have  largely usurped print publications &#8211; tend to discuss the appearances of  women more often than those of men, take their music less seriously,  stereotype them and incorrectly attribute their successes to male  coworkers. These double standards govern how women and men are viewed in  general, rather than being specific to music criticism and reporting.  Music journalism is a product of its culture’s gender roles and consumer  demands. When this culture combines with mainstream pop and rock  publications’ largely male staff and the sexism already prevalent in the  music business they address, critics unwittingly carry on tropes that  they have the power to ameliorate.<em><br />
</em></p></blockquote>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>So,  as noted ice-skater V. I. Lenin once asked, what is to be done? First,  let’s acknowledge how many women are interested, engaged, and actively  writing about music. Female music bloggers <a href="http://www.blogher.com/where-are-women-music-bloggers-or-fans" target="_blank">may still constitute a niche</a>, but <a href="http://dontdanceherdownboys.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">as</a> <a href="http://www.pinknoises.com/pn_home.html" target="_blank">all</a> <a href="http://wearsthetrousers.com" target="_blank">these</a> <a href="http://thegirlsare.wordpress.com">sites</a> <a href="http://jukeboxheroines.wordpress.com">show</a>, we are out there. Blogs are necessary and useful &#8211; journalist and promoter Sara Sherr <a href="http://www.thedailyfemme.com/femme/2010/11/interview-with-music-journalist-and-sugar-town-founder-sara-sherr/" target="_blank">urges</a> female writers to<em> ‘pitch, pitch, pitch… If no one publishes you, start a  blog’</em> &#8211; but should be accompanied by a concerted attempt to address the  mainstream’s failure to acknowledge the validity of other voices, and to recognise the benefits of a personal and emotional contribution, in its construction of a  credible approach to music.</p>
<blockquote><p>The  more women who are seen to be writing about music, the more women will  write about music, and the more the dynamics and conventions and  hierarchies of writing about music (by both women and men) change  because of more equal participation in it, the more we all benefit, the  more the form progresses. – <a href="http://www.upliftmagazine.com/uplift/2009/02/frances-morgan-of-plan-b-talks-women-in-music-journalism" target="_blank">Frances Morgan</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Active  and visible participation by women is a key part of promoting  perspectives beyond the mainstream, an expansion which can only enrich  the analysis, understanding and enjoyment of music. The road we take  from here needs to pass through the land of a thousand dances as well as  a thousand doctorates.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let  me begin with some residual New Year <em>bonhomie </em>by saying that the <strong>New  Yorker</strong>’s music critic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Ross_%28music_critic%29">Alex Ross</a> is not the problem here. It’s just that  one sometimes needs to take an inventory of the symptoms before starting  on the cause. Last month I attended a talk by Ross on the release of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/nov/28/alex-ross-listen-to-this-review" target="_blank">his latest book</a>.  The talk and the discussion which followed were was interesting enough,  but throughout the evening I couldn’t help noticing that, although  there were several women in attendance, every single raised voice in the  room was male.</p>
<p>Hardly  revelatory, I know. This time last year, I contributed to a relatively  prominent and very good music blog’s retrospective on the best songs of  the past decade. More depressing if grimly predictable than Kate Nash’s  inclusion in the best-of was the fact that, out of over forty  contributors, I was one of only two women. From the demise of  <strong><a href="http://www.planbmag.com/" target="_blank">Plan B magazine</a></strong>,  with its conscious commitment to encouraging female writers, to Anwyn  Crawford’s recent rebuke of <strong>The Wire</strong>, the current lack of female voices  in mainstream music criticism is a truth universally acknowledged.</p>

<p>As  part of Ross’s audience, I’m not saying I felt excluded or unwelcome,  nor did I find the questions less interesting, relevant or articulate  for being asked in a masculine rather than feminine register. But  something did click with me when, towards the discussion’s end, a man  towards the front reticently asked Ross: &#8220;This might sound a silly  question, but – do you like to dance?&#8221;</p>
<p>The  opening caveat there is as important as the question itself. Let’s  start with the latter, which threw into sharp relief the varying ways  one can engage with music. Let&#8217;s call the difference that of Pure versus  Applied. Where Alex Ross excels is his ability to demystify music,  separating and examining its component parts. This scholarly and almost  clinical approach can succeed brilliantly, particularly when discussing  Ross’s first love, classical music. But, as an exclusive approach, I find  it lacking, and the absence of attention to dancing helps explain why.</p>
<p>I  find it very hard to think of any song I truly love that I cannot also  dance to &#8211; whether by ‘dance’ I mean drunken mock-waltzing to <strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnijX0TH-w">(White  Man) In Hammersmith Palais</a></strong> or that routine one does to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkuOAY-S6OY"><strong>Killing in the  Name Of</strong></a><strong> </strong>which involves attempting to stab your knees with your  eyebrows. I intellectually analyse the music I love, scouring its  lyrical content and its social and cultural context for meaning to  enhance my enjoyment of it, but not necessarily to justify my enjoying it in the first place. I am equally interested simply in  experiencing its rhythm, its flow, its grind, its melody, the way it  makes me want to move as well as the mechanics of how it achieves that,  its impact on my body as well as my brain. I attach as much weight to a  physical and emotional response as to a cerebral anatomising of music.  Until that question was asked, the talk had concentrated wholly on the  latter, lacking any consideration of the former, equally useful,  dimension of how music works. So no, it wasn’t ‘a silly question’. Why  the questioner, and we, might feel that it is, perhaps approaches the  heart of the matter.</p>
<p>I’m  sceptical of the patronising and reductive idea that men and women  appreciate music in intrinsically different ways, men with a cold and technical analysis and women with an exclusively personal and emotional  response. But this scepticism is a continual struggle against the weight  of cultural conditioning and its success in bequeathing to boys and  girls approved modes of engagement<em>.</em> The male = analytical/female = emotional  dichotomy is a counterproductive product of social training, and  identifying and questioning this assumption in relation to engagement  with music is part of breaking down the barriers between genders and  combating sexism in general. Doing so is hindered, however, by the  extent to which these different approaches are accorded varying weight  in wider discourse, with prevailing attitudes in music criticism  privileging one over another. The implications of this will be explored in Part Two.</p>
