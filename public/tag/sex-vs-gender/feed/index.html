<h2 style="text-align: center;">OVARY</h2>
<h3>Oh! Darling.</h3>
<p><em>Ovary</em> hopped onto the semantic stage around 1658 meaning &#8216;the female organ of reproduction in animals, in which <em>ova </em>or eggs are produced&#8217; (<em>ova </em>being the Latin plural form of <em>ovum </em>= egg). Eggs, of course, are now generally recognised as a crucial part of reproduction in all species (a chicken ovulates every day, fact fans), making the <em>ovary </em>rather important for the construction of little&#8217;uns. Straightforwardly, the word derives from <em>ovarium: </em>&#8216;ovum&#8217; + &#8216;-arium&#8217; (aquarium, oceanarium, planetarium, toastarium). Consistency: it&#8217;s helpful. But hold! 1658? Really? What about before? Was there some mass genital evolution in the late seventeenth century that made early modern cisgendered Woman so drastically different from her medieval sisters?</p>

<p>Well no, but there was an evolution in what Scientists considered &#8220;Woman&#8221; to be. For hundreds of thousands of years previous, the established thinking had been that they were simply men &#8216;turned outside-in&#8217;: female genitals were held &#8216;up there&#8217; by a colder body temperature than their male counterparts, and, thus, sex differences were a matter of degree. Women were men who hadn&#8217;t quite unfurled properly.</p>
<h3>Oh My God</h3>
<p>With this thinking, the <em>vagina</em> became an inverted penis, the <em>labia</em> a foreskin, the <em>uterus </em>a scrotum, and the <em>ovaries</em> testicles – and all these now-familiar gynecological terms date from the same period: the <span style="color: #000000;">oft-maligned</span> <em>vagina</em> (= &#8216;sheath&#8217;) is faux-Latin from 1680,<em> labia</em> (= &#8216;lip&#8217;) slightly earlier (1630s) and <em>uterus</em> the earliest, from 1610 (although, <span style="color: #000000;"><a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/11/22/an-alphabet-of-femininism-8-h-is-for-hysteria/">as already mentioned in these pixellated pages</a></span>, it was conflated with the gender-neutral &#8216;womb&#8217; or &#8216;belly&#8217;, its original Latinate meaning). Pre-seventeenth century <em>ovaries </em>were consequently referred to as &#8216;female testicles&#8217; or &#8216;stones&#8217;, and the synonymity was so literal as to accept the possibility that if a girl got too hot through strenuous exercise, her entire reproductive system could <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XR2BcRwiG-sC&amp;pg=PA127&amp;lpg=PA127&amp;dq=marie+germain+montaigne&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wUFyuQjNb2&amp;sig=ljtQ1Xb5-TMH8RfJfyae_XtbgGg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=plY8TYLHBpGYhQeqjJGxCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=marie%20germain%20montaigne&amp;f=false">accidentally pop out and turn her into a boy</a>.</p>
<p>So if sex was a false distinction to make, how did male and female manage to breed? Seventeenth-century scientists approached this question firstly through <a href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/aris-bio/">Aristotle</a> and his theory of epigenesis (= &#8216;origin through growth&#8217;). Aristotle reckoned male semen gave the embryo its form, and female menstrual blood supplied the raw materials.<sup><a href="/2011/01/24/an-alphabet-of-femininism-15-o-is-for-ovary/#footnote_0_1950" id="identifier_0_1950" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" Yes, menstrual blood. ">1</a></sup> The &#8216;soul&#8217; enters the embryo at the moment the mother first feels the baby kick.</p>
<p>However, by suggesting new people can spring into being organically, epigenesis risks dispensing with divine involvement. Not cool. So a much <span style="font-size: 13.2px;">more palatable alternative, for seventeenth-century scientists, was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spermist_theory">preformation</a> (the idea that the parents&#8217; seed already contained a miniature adult, so <a href="http://www.hps.cam.ac.uk/visibleembryos/s1_4.html">all the embryo has to do is increase in size</a>). Bit creepy, right? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaas_Hartsoeker">Nicolaas Hartsoeker</a> (1656-1725) was well into this idea and even claimed he could see these &#8216;homunculi&#8217; through the microscope (above, right).</span></p>
<p>But once this had been agreed, there came the inevitable Swiftian debate about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilliput_and_Blefuscu">how you like your eggs</a>, with scientists divided into &#8216;aminalculists&#8217; and &#8216;ovists&#8217;: those who were with Hartsoeker in believing the &#8216;germ&#8217; of life to be in the sperm, and those who preferred the &#8216;egg&#8217; (= &#8216;the female&#8217;). Arguing in favour of the latter was the (understandable) confusion about why God would be so wasteful as to create thousands of Hartsoekerean sperm-germs to be lost on every egg-ward excursion for the sake of one single fertilization: from the outside, the female looked a bit more efficient.</p>
<p><strong>Oh! You Pretty Things</strong></p>
<p>But clearly, all this Knowledge was better on the subject of males than females (and even the women themselves were hard pressed to explain menstruation or recognise pregnancy): <span style="font-size: 13.2px;"><em>ova </em>were still shrouded in mystery, and <em>ovulation </em>a great unknown – it was not even certain whether human females could conceive without orgasm, or if they were more like cats, rabbits, llamas (now known as &#8216;induced ovulators&#8217;) and, er, men. Official advice erred on the side of caution and recommended that both man and wife reach orgasm during procreation – as a side-effect, a rapist could get off scott-free if his victim fell pregnant, since, until the nineteenth century, the law worked backwards and considered conception to imply enjoyment and, therefore, consent.</span></p>
<p>It is William Harvey (1578-1657), most famous for &#8216;discovering&#8217; the circulation of the blood, who is commonly credited with realising the importance of an <em>ovary</em>-thing, and the frontispiece to his treatise on the subject blazons th<span style="font-size: 13.2px;">e tag &#8216;<em>ex ovo omnia</em>&#8216; (&#8216;everything from the egg&#8217;). But he was thinking less of a modern day &#8216;<a href="http://www.theodora.com/anatomy/the_ovum.html">egg cell</a>&#8216; and more of a &#8216;spirit&#8217;: an <em>egg</em> was the mother&#8217;s &#8216;idea&#8217; of a fetus which was &#8216;ignited&#8217; in her womb during sex. It was a general generative catalyst, not technical anatomy – as is clear from the image (below, left).</span></p>

<h3><strong>Oh My Gosh</strong></h3>
<p>After kicking around for just over a century, <em>ovary</em> suddenly became enshrined in anatomy books as an independent organ that somehow encapsulated &#8216;woman&#8217;: in 1844 Achille Chereau declared that &#8216;it is only because of the ovary that woman is what she is&#8217; (oh dear). In part, this was to do with a retreat from the previous centuries&#8217; idea that women and men were anatomically the same and an advance towards the notion that sex equalled gender (a surprisingly modern invention, if you listen to <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Making-Sex-Gender-Greeks-Freud/dp/0674543556/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1294676447&amp;sr=8-1">Thomas Laqueur</a>). With this came an increasing focus on specifically &#8216;women&#8217;s&#8217; problems via <em>hysteria </em>(= <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/11/22/an-alphabet-of-femininism-8-h-is-for-hysteria/">&#8216;womb trouble&#8217;</a>), and, neatly (if disturbingly) a favourite cure for this pre-Freud was the <em>bilateral ovariotomy</em>, also dubbed &#8216;female castration&#8217;: removing a patient&#8217;s healthy <em>ovaries </em>to man them up a bit (just as men become &#8216;feminized&#8217; through removal of the testicles). The <em>ovariotomy </em>would thus, it was believed, act not just as a cure for hysteria, but also for behavioural pathologies including nymphomania, and even general aches and pains. Of course, it also stopped menstruation, rendered women infertile and carried risks endemic to c19th surgery methods. WE DON&#8217;T KNOW WHAT THIS DOES, SO LET&#8217;S JUST TAKE IT OUT.</p>
<p>It was not until the 1930s that scientists got near a hormonal understanding of <em>ovulation</em>, how it worked and how it could be controlled. Here we really should give a nod to that symbol of 1960s sexual liberation: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_oral_contraceptive_pill">combined oral contraceptive pill</a>, a great source of division between parents and children, as epitomised in the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/dec/13/people-inspired-pop-songs-muses">backstory</a> to the seminal Beatles song <strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lG3nXyI41M">She&#8217;s Leaving Home</a> </strong>(1967). See, children of the 1920s and 30s must have found the idea of their daughters silently and imperceptibly controlling their <em>ovulation</em> terrifying, whereas the children of the 1960s saw such control as simple empowerment. In miniature, this gives us the whole history of <em>ovary </em>and its linguistic cognates: what cannot be seen is inevitably free for appropriation by a host of meanings. Meaningarium.</p>
