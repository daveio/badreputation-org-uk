										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, I hope you all had a lovely summer!  My August seems to have been a perpetual cycle of pre-rain, rain and post-rain, with varying levels of humidity just to keep things interesting.  Good job I don&#8217;t mind staying inside, isn&#8217;t it?  This month there hasn&#8217;t been much <em>new</em> that has taken my fancy &#8211; with the exception of <strong>Unmechanical</strong>, everything has mostly been new content or just new <em>to me.</em>  August never seems to have much in the way of games, and moreover it tends to be the realm of the cinema releases.  But we&#8217;re here to talk about games!  Let&#8217;s get going.</p>
<h3>Unmechanical</h3>
<p><a title="Unmechanical.net" href="http://unmechanical.net/" target="_blank"><strong>Unmechanical</strong></a> is a sweet indie puzzler that is<a title="Imgur album: Unmechanical" href="http://imgur.com/a/3lrRR" target="_blank"> pretty darn gorgeous</a> on the eyes too.  It combines a variety of different puzzles (physics, logic, memory) on your quest for freedom through an underground labyrinth designed to feel at once organic and mechanical.  You are a little blue helicopter thing that&#8217;s been abducted from the surface world and dropped into this maze.  You can fly, and you have a tractor beam, but aside from bumping into things like a confused bee there&#8217;s not much else you can do.  The way you navigate and solve puzzles relies on your interactions with stimuli around you, pulling levers and lifting rocks with your tractor beam to get the desired result.  The puzzles range from the fairly familiar &#8211; like the remember-the-pattern puzzle involving four different coloured bulbs that make different noises &#8211; to the far-reaching and complicated.  It&#8217;s great fun and a well-composed title &#8211; there&#8217;s a neat bit of thinking alongside the Aww-Factor -and it&#8217;s available through a variety of digital content platforms (<strong>Steam</strong>, <strong>Gog</strong>, <strong>Gamersgate</strong> &amp; <strong>OnLive</strong> plus it&#8217;ll soon be coming to the <strong>AppStore</strong> (for those of you that use <strong>Apple</strong> products).  Free demos are also out there on the aforementioned platforms or <a title="Unmechanical Demo" href="http://unmechanical.net/play/" target="_blank">straight from the site</a>.</p>

<h3>Team Fortress: Mann vs Machine</h3>
<p><a title="Team Fortress: Mann vs Machine" href="http://www.teamfortress.com/mvm/" target="_blank"><strong>Mann vs Machine</strong></a> is the new Co-op mode for <strong>Team Fortress 2</strong> and yet another sizeable update/announcement coming from the <strong>Valve</strong> camp<em> (could it be all a distraction to disguise a lacking of<strong> Half Life 3</strong>?)</em>.  In keeping with <strong>TF2</strong> Free to Play mantra, you can play these new Co-op maps on community servers in what is called &#8220;Boot Camp&#8221; &#8211; but, should you so desire to, you can also pay to enter &#8220;Mann Up Mode&#8221; in which you can get the chance to win rare items as a reward for completing missions and the Tour of Duty.  Currently there&#8217;s only one Tour of Duty (&#8220;Steel Trap&#8221;) consisting of six missions; in Mann Up Mode you have to pay with a Tour of Duty Ticket for each mission, and these are 59p/99c each from the Mann Co Store.</p>
<p>Lured by the promise of rare items, I paid to get into Mann Up Mode and completed a Tour.  Unlike my partner, who has now completed three Tours and hasn&#8217;t had any SuperCoolRares, I got a rare item at the end of my Tour.  Woo!  That&#8217;s not the best thing I want to talk about, though.  The Co-op mode itself is pretty awesome, and a great addition to TF2, because for once you <em>all</em> have to work together, even if you aren&#8217;t Pro, with a bunch of people you have been allocated.  It can create a really fun atmosphere if you get a good &#8211; and nice &#8211; team.  The robot army you have to defeat presents a challenge if you don&#8217;t learn quickly how to coordinate and function as a team.  Normal multiplayer doesn&#8217;t tend to require this much interaction with other humans (unless you&#8217;re a pre-formed team who know what they&#8217;re doing) and so the update has successfully added a new dimension to the experience of <strong>TF2</strong>.  Needless to say, however, if you get a rubbish team with too many ill-informed egomaniacs, you won&#8217;t get far.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Valve encountered some problems with this update.  At times the servers die, you can&#8217;t access Multi-player or Co-op because the allocator has crashed, the store shuts and everyone gets grumpy.  These issues seem to be being worked on so just have a little patience.</p>
<h3>Other Stuff</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve also been playing <strong>Borderlands</strong> again, in preparation for<strong> Borderlands 2</strong> (release date 17/09/12), but I was a bit disappointed by the <a title="The BorderHouse Blog: Stop calling it Girlfriend Mode" href="http://borderhouseblog.com/?p=8967" target="_blank">&#8216;Girlfriend Mode&#8217;</a> gaffe.  <strong>Borderlands</strong> is very fun, very entertaining and pretty in-yer-face; while it would be easy to criticise some of their portrayal of women in the game I think it&#8217;d also be fairly misguided.  The game isn&#8217;t one to be taken seriously: it makes a mockery out of pretty much everything, so it&#8217;s a fair assumption that they&#8217;re probably poking fun when it comes to female characters too.  I tell myself they&#8217;re doing it to make a point; satirise the gaming<em> status quo</em>, if you like.</p>
<p>So, with that in mind, I was disappointed to see someone from the developers being stupid enough to utter the phrase &#8220;Girlfriend Mode&#8221; in reference to the <em>I&#8217;m New To First Person Shooters and Don&#8217;t Know What To Do</em> mode.  I admit, I take it personally when these things come up: I&#8217;ve played FPS games longer than my <em><strong>boy</strong></em>friend (and a lot of male gamers I know) so it really does hack me off when it is assumed no female gamer ever likes FPS of their own volition. <em> <strong>I like shooting things! What&#8217;s so weird about that?</strong></em></p>
<p>Despite this foolishness, I haven&#8217;t cancelled my pre-order of <strong>Borderlands 2</strong>. Why? Well, there&#8217;s the reasons I&#8217;ve mentioned above, plus the fact there are more female characters &#8211; and they do look amazingly kickass. I want to get to know them.  In turn, so will you, as that&#8217;s pretty much the only thing I expect to play in September &#8211; yay!</p>
<p>In contrast with the irritating &#8216;Girlfriend Mode&#8217; story, I&#8217;d like to bring you a little Well Done story.  <strong>Guild Wars 2</strong> has gone live and <strong>ArenaNet</strong> have tried, it seems, to make the most welcoming community possible &#8211; and they&#8217;ve caught a lot of flack for it.  They&#8217;ve been suspending people.  Oh no! you say, why ever would they do that?  Because they&#8217;re actually sticking to their own rules and upholding them for the benefit of the majority of gamers who don&#8217;t feel the need to be odious.</p>
<p>Let me explain. ArenaNet are upholding their <a title="Guild Wars 2 Naming Policy" href="https://www.guildwars2.com/en/legal/guild-wars-2-naming-policy/" target="_blank">Naming Policy</a> on characters, which is pretty commendable (both the list and sticking to it), but some gamers felt the need to whine when they got banned.  Admittedly, some banned-users&#8217; names weren&#8217;t in contravention of the policy so ArenaNet took to Reddit and told them all (and in doing so shamed the perpetrators publicly) that their ban was <a title="Kotaku: Reasons you may be suspended from Guild Wars 2" href="http://kotaku.com/5938485/reasons-you-may-be-suspended-from-guild-wars-2-holocaust-jokes-racist-insults-etc" target="_blank">due to their inappropriate chat</a>, which I warn you isn&#8217;t nice.  So, I say Well Done to ArenaNet for keeping horrible arsebags out of the community (even if the suspensions are only 72 hours) and trying to make <strong>Guild Wars 2</strong> a welcoming and inclusive experience for all its gamers.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A lil' competition for the gamers in our readerbase! ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>July has been very empty on my playing schedule.  Moving house &#8211; all those <em>boxes</em> &#8211; kinda took it out of me.  I&#8217;ve just been pottering on <a href="http://www.teamfortress.com"><strong>TF2</strong></a> and aside from that I finally finished <a href="http://www.ea.com/dead-space-2"><strong>Dead Space 2</strong></a> in one 3-hour stint.  I&#8217;m also on holiday from the end of July so, that&#8217;s put a deadline on things.  I thought to myself,<em> &#8220;What can I bring to Gamer Diary this month if I haven&#8217;t played anything?&#8221;</em> and then, while gormlessly starting at <strong>Steam</strong>, I had an idea: a competition!  So, at the end of this post there&#8217;ll be some details on how you could win one of the titles I&#8217;ve written about this year (via Steam).</p>
<p>First I&#8217;ll give you something of substance.</p>
<p>The posts I wrote last month (<a title="[Gamer Diary] From Indie Camaraderie to “Get back in the kitchen, slut!”: recent ups and downs of the internet gamingverse" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/07/05/gamer-diary-from-indie-camaraderie-to-get-back-in-the-kitchen-slut-the-ups-and-downs-of-the-internet-gaming-verse/">here</a> and <a title="[Gamer Diary] Rollercoaster June: an addendum" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/07/06/gamer-diary-rollercoaster-june-an-addendum/">here</a>) were somewhat laden with negativity &#8211; you could say legitimately &#8211; so I thought that for this offering I&#8217;d continue to talk about our gaming community and the relationship developers have with their audiences.  Most importantly, I&#8217;d like to highlight a couple of examples of those who are getting it right.  Or, at the very least &#8211; because no one can be perfect &#8211; who seem to be doing it better than others.</p>
<p>There are a lot of devs and publishers who have their plus points, and there are those that have their negatives.  Most have both, but some are more <em>memorable</em> for either one of these polar options.  For this post I&#8217;d like to look at the ones who are most famed for being a little bit awesome.</p>
<p>It being summer, those who know them will not be surprised that I&#8217;m going to bring up <strong>Valve</strong>.  During the <em>Meet the Pyro</em> update for <strong>Team Fortress 2</strong>, they announced the <strong>Source Filmmaker</strong>, and as the Summer Sale began, they announced <strong>Greenlight</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/source_filmmaker.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="11562" data-permalink="/2012/07/30/gamer-diary-what-ive-been-playing-july-2012-community-relations-and-a-competition/source_filmmaker/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/source_filmmaker.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="600,400" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Source Filmmaker" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/source_filmmaker.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/source_filmmaker.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignleft  wp-image-11562" title="Source Filmmaker" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/source_filmmaker.jpg?resize=360%2C240" alt="source filmmaker title screen - white lettering on black background with a gold film reel graphic" width="360" height="240" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/source_filmmaker.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/source_filmmaker.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>I jumped on <a title="Source Filmmaker" href="http://sourcefilmmaker.com/" target="_blank">Filmmaker</a> and have quite enjoyed playing with it.  Here&#8217;s my one-and-only even-vaguely-close-to-finished <a title="YouTube: Solider/Demo Showdown (wvelkala)" href="http://youtu.be/QN1asTKDaso" target="_blank">short I made</a>.  The tutorials started off simply enough but after a few of them, &#8216;Bay&#8217; (our guide) seems to dispense with the explaining-it-to-a-layperson format and just starts blurting jargon at you left, right and centre.  Hence why I haven&#8217;t finished the tutorial video yet. (That and the fact I got distracted with my little Western-style showdown there.)</p>
<p>One other criticism at this point is that the Store Page (on Steam) for the Filmmaker has a list of minimum system requirements, but not all of these are accurate.  The page lists that you need a minimum resolution of 1366 x 768, which I had, but this creates problems with displaying all the necessary functions of the tool.  I had to bump up to the &#8220;suggested&#8221; 1920 x 1080 in order to get full functionality out of it.  But, hey, it&#8217;s free, it&#8217;s pretty fun and is a great way to get involved in the community.</p>
<p>Now, <a title="Steam Greenlight" href="http://steamcommunity.com/greenlight/" target="_blank">Greenlight</a> is not something I expect to benefit from &#8211; as I&#8217;m not a developer &#8211; but I will definitely be checking it out from a voter&#8217;s perspective.  Here&#8217;s the basic premise: lots of games get submitted to Valve looking to be sold via Steam; they started to think maybe there was a better way of selecting games; having seen the success of the Workshop ratings system they thought of employing a similar thing for games; Greenlight allows developers to submit their games and be at the mercy of the community.  In theory, if the community likes your game(s), you get high ratings/votes, and your game gets to go to Steam and be sold through the client.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/greenligh_SOON.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="11561" data-permalink="/2012/07/30/gamer-diary-what-ive-been-playing-july-2012-community-relations-and-a-competition/greenligh_soon/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/greenligh_SOON.jpg?fit=949%2C211&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="949,211" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Steam Greenlight: Coming Soon" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/greenligh_SOON.jpg?fit=300%2C66&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/greenligh_SOON.jpg?fit=949%2C211&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-11561" title="Steam Greenlight: Coming Soon" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/greenligh_SOON.jpg?resize=531%2C118" alt="Title screen reading 'Greenlight: coming soon' in green on a black background" width="531" height="118" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/greenligh_SOON.jpg?w=949&amp;ssl=1 949w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/greenligh_SOON.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 531px) 100vw, 531px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a brilliant opportunity for a <em>lot</em> of smalltime and bedroom developers to get recognition for their work, to build a fanbase and maybe make some money out of their work.  So, Steam users of BadRep, get behind this!  When it arrives, let&#8217;s make sure we show Valve this is a good tool to help out the smalltimers.</p>
<h3>Competition Time!</h3>
<p>In celebration of a variety of things (Valve being awesome, &#8220;summer&#8221;, I&#8217;ve been at BR Towers over a year now&#8230;) I thought a little gaming giveaway would be nice.  As BR is voluntary, this is me buying prizes for you guys, so given that I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll understand why this competition happens to follow the Steam Summer Sale.</p>
<h3>Up for grabs:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Torchlight</strong> &#8211; as mentioned <a title="[Gamer Diary] What I’ve been playing… June 2012" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/07/12/gamer-diary-what-ive-been-playing-june-2012/" target="_blank">June&#8217;s &#8220;&#8230;Playing&#8221;</a> post.</li>
<li><strong>Bastion</strong> &#8211; also from June (see link above).</li>
<li><strong>LIMBO</strong> &#8211; recently part of Humble Bundle V (discussed <a title="[Gamer Diary] From Indie Camaraderie to “Get back in the kitchen, slut!”: recent ups and downs of the internet gamingverse" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/07/05/gamer-diary-from-indie-camaraderie-to-get-back-in-the-kitchen-slut-the-ups-and-downs-of-the-internet-gaming-verse/" target="_blank">here</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How to enter:</span></p>
<p>Leave a comment on this post (they do not automatically see the light of the internet so your details will only be seen by Team BadRep) and remember to include an email address linked to a Steam account or your Steam ID and which of the three games you&#8217;d prefer.</p>
<p>Early in August I&#8217;ll collect all the details, and using some funky random number generators to do some description of Name-out-of-the-Hat magic, I&#8217;ll then get in touch with winners to arrange the gifting of their new Steam game.</p>
<p>Simple as that, really.  Good luck!</p>
<p>But if you&#8217;re feeling generous, could you spare a couple of minutes <a title="SurveyMonkey: Can the consumer influence the creator?" href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/RX9V7ZY" target="_blank">to complete this little survey</a>?</p>

					<description><![CDATA[As promised, I actually played games this month!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As promised, I actually played games this month! I started off with <strong>Portal 2</strong>&#8216;s Perpetual Testing Initiative (which I mentioned <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/05/09/gamer-diary-what-ive-been-playing-april-2012/">last month</a>) I tried my hand at the Puzzle Maker to make <a title="Steam Workshop: Wvelkala" href="http://steamcommunity.com/id/wvelkala/myworkshopfiles/?appid=620" target="_blank">a few test chambers</a>.  You may notice from my efforts that I might, maybe, possibly, probably, harbour a teeny love of Deadly Goo.  Having attempted to use <strong>Valve</strong>&#8216;s <a title="Wikipedia: Valve Hammer Editor" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_Hammer_Editor" target="_blank">Hammer Editor</a> in the past to make maps for <strong>Portal 2</strong>, I can say that the new in-game Puzzle Maker is much simpler.</p>
<p>Obviously the simplicity has benefits as well as negative points: it&#8217;s simpler to use, so therefore more of the community can try their hand at map-making for an extremely popular title.  This is demonstrated by the fact that since the Puzzle Maker has been available, the number of<strong> <a title="Steam Workshop" href="http://steamcommunity.com/workshop" target="_blank">Steam Workshop</a></strong> files for <strong>Portal 2</strong> has shot up to nearly 100,000 (by comparison, <strong>Team Fortress 2</strong> has close to 5k and <strong>Skyrim</strong> just over 7k)<sup><a href="/2012/06/08/gamer-diary-what-ive-been-playing-may-2012/#footnote_0_11110" id="identifier_0_11110" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" as of 9am, 31.05.12 ">1</a></sup> despite being the newest edition to the Workshop repertoire.</p>
<div id="attachment_11122" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/mountainseamap.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11122" data-attachment-id="11122" data-permalink="/2012/06/08/gamer-diary-what-ive-been-playing-may-2012/mountainseamap/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/mountainseamap.jpg?fit=600%2C337&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="600,337" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="I am the Mountain, I am the Sea &#8211; Steam Workshop Portal 2 Test Chamber" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/mountainseamap.jpg?fit=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/mountainseamap.jpg?fit=600%2C337&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-11122" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/mountainseamap-300x168.jpg?resize=300%2C168" alt="Screenshot of a test chamber from Portal 2 by the author." width="300" height="168" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/mountainseamap.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/mountainseamap.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/mountainseamap.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-11122" class="wp-caption-text">My first test chamber for Portal 2</p></div>
<p>The negatives, I feel, come with the restrictions you face with what is available to you in the Puzzle Maker: e.g. you can&#8217;t add extra doors for staged testing.  Plus, try as I might to create things exactly as I imagine them in my head, it never seems to be quite right as not all the tools are available to you.  The solution here would be to learn how to use Hammer properly&#8230; but for a lot of fans that&#8217;s a bit too confusing to contemplate.</p>
<p>So, you may be wondering why my production of test chamber blueprints stopped mind-May&#8230; the answer is <strong>Diablo 3</strong>.  This hit internationally on May 15th and domestically (in the UK) May 18th.  After some very irritating cock-ups from various pre-order suppliers, I eventually got my hands on it for the UK release date.</p>
<p>I must say I&#8217;m sort of glad I didn&#8217;t get a copy until May 18th as Blizzard had some serious issues on the international release. Let me explore these. <strong>D3</strong> is both single and multiplayer but you <em>have to be online all the time, on Battle.net&#8217;s servers even to play on your own</em>.  No, it doesn&#8217;t make sense to me either.  Couple that with the fact that their servers clearly weren&#8217;t ready &#8211; nor capable &#8211; of handling the volume of people trying to connect.  Again, <em>just to play single player</em>.</p>
<p>Error 37 screengrabs were plastered all over the internet as eager fans were raging at Blizzard.  That&#8217;s not to say I didn&#8217;t escape: I&#8217;ve had three instances since I got the game where I&#8217;ve been unable to play because the damned servers were having a tea break (or eating themselves, I dunno) with Error 35 taking out the game on May 20th for over 9 hours and Error 37 rearing its ugly head again nearer the end of the month (<em>Error 35 = servers down for maintenance; Error 37 = servers are busy</em>).</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the one <strong>major</strong> drawback of the game.  The interwebs have been awash with rumours of an &#8220;offline mode&#8221;, but whether Blizz decide to actually do it or not only time will tell.</p>
<p>Enough of that.  The game itself is great fun with brilliantly detailed graphics and fun attacks for all classes.  This is the first RPG of this type (<a title="Wikipedia: Hand and Slash" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hack_and_slash" target="_blank">the hack&#8217;n&#8217;slash</a>) that I&#8217;ve actually finished &#8211; albeit only on normal difficulty &#8211; and am now going through it again to try and find better loot (so far unsuccessfully).  The fact that I haven&#8217;t got bored yet is praise in itself as I do have a tendency to just wander off despite all my intentions to play through as every class and on every difficulty.  Again, time will tell if I do end up admitting defeat.</p>
<p>Blizz have done OK with the female characters; yes, they start off fairly under-dressed but so do the male counterparts.  My one criticism is the fem-Demon Hunter&#8217;s boots&#8230; why would you wear heels (at all!) to fight the prime evil?  Seriously.  <em>Oh, and the occasional armour vs. cleavage fail is a given.</em></p>
<p>In between my battling of evil I made a brief foray into the world of the mod.  The mod in question is <strong><a title="Mod DB: Centralia" href="http://www.moddb.com/mods/centralia" target="_blank">Centralia: Part 1</a></strong>, which is the opening sequence of a game developed as a mod for <strong>Half Life 2: Episode 2</strong>.  I&#8217;ve written a more general review over <a title="The Talking Automaton: Centralia" href="http://thetalkingautomaton.wordpress.com/2012/05/30/centralia/" target="_blank">here</a> but I felt it worth a mention as <strong>a)</strong> it doesn&#8217;t involve shooting guns or killing things and<strong> b)</strong> yeah, OK, my brother is one of the devs.</p>
<p>The idea behind it is (I paraphrase) &#8220;to make creepy places fun&#8221;, so they&#8217;ve taken an extraordinary story from real life (<a title="Wikipedia: Centralia, PA" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centralia,_Pennsylvania" target="_blank">Centralia, PA</a>) and added some more spooky to the mix.  Even though it&#8217;s pretty short for now, it still managed to make me jump a couple of times.</p>
<div id="attachment_11123" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/outside_mock_v10051.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11123" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-11123" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/outside_mock_v10051-300x240.jpg?resize=300%2C240" alt="" width="300" height="240" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-11123" class="wp-caption-text">A still from the beginning of Centralia</p></div>
<p>It is a genuinely interesting concept for a game and I&#8217;d quite like to see where it goes, but to do that I first have to persuade my bro to set up a <strong>KickStarter</strong> fund, then he has to get funded through it.  <em>Blah, blah austerity etc.</em></p>
<h3>Tropes Vs Women in Games: a cool thing for you to throw money at</h3>
<p>As I&#8217;ve mentioned KickStarter, we here at BR had <a title="Kickstarter: Tropes vs Women in Games" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/566429325/tropes-vs-women-in-video-games" target="_blank">this </a>drawn to our attention.  <strong>Tropes vs. Women in Video Games</strong> is the brainchild of Anita of <strong><a title="Feminist Frequency" href="http://www.feministfrequency.com/" target="_blank">Feminist Frequency</a> </strong>who is hoping to make a series of films based on, well, tropes of women in video games.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;The series will highlight the larger reoccurring patterns and conventions used within the gaming industry rather than just focusing on the worst offenders.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe frameborder="0" height="360px" src="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/566429325/tropes-vs-women-in-video-games/widget/video.html" width="480px"></iframe></p>
<p>This looks promising, and who here <em>wouldn&#8217;t</em> want to get paid to play games and make films about it?  Exactly.</p>
<h3>Next Month:</h3>
<p>There will be <strong>Max Payne 3</strong> &#8211; as the PC edition got delayed so it didn&#8217;t have to do battle with Diablo 3 &#8211; and probably (<em>finally</em>) some<strong> AC: Revelations</strong> as I now have a copy waiting for me.  I suspect there will be more but I haven&#8217;t thought that far ahead yet!</p>
<h3>But! Before I go, an Assassin&#8217;s Creed note&#8230;</h3>
<p>Just quickly, <a title="Borderhouse Blog" href="http://borderhouseblog.com/?p=8511" target="_blank">this</a> has just popped up on the internet: promise of a female protagonist in an <strong>Assassin&#8217;s Creed</strong> title!  It will be a &#8220;companion game&#8221; to <strong>AC3</strong>, subtitled<strong><em> Liberation</em></strong>, but will only be on the PS Vita.  Borderhouse (follow the link) say:</p>
<blockquote><p>What’s interesting and exciting is that the protagonist of the game will be a woman of color named Aveline.</p></blockquote>
<p>Admittedly, yes, that is pretty interesting &#8211; and awesome &#8211; but being me I have to push the cynic buttons and raise two points. First, <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/03/13/gamer-diary-assassins-creed-3-reactions-roundtable/">we&#8217;ve talked about this before</a>, and I will keep banging on about it until it surfaces for definite: is this the &#8220;her&#8221; Juno mentioned at the end of Brotherhood?  This mysterious lady-assassin that Desmond has to find before he can defeat the Templars?  My guess is: no.  If it&#8217;s running concurrent to <strong>AC3</strong> he can&#8217;t have found her yet as, surely, her story comes <em>after</em> his ends (after another <strong>three games</strong>).</p>
<p>Secondly, PS Vita?  <em>Really?</em>  An over-expensive handheld with few titles and not nearly as many users as Xbox 360/Ps3/PC?  <em>That&#8217;s </em>where you decide to premiere your first femprotag of the franchise?  You don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s a little bit sidelining?  I suspect the peeps over at Ubisoft are expecting only the die hards to buy it, which means they aren&#8217;t too bothered about offering up a viable femprotag for the <em>mainstream </em>just yet.</p>
<p>Or, maybe they&#8217;re testing the waters for the Elusive Female Assassin that will save the world.  Or, maybe Aveline is &#8220;her&#8221;. Prove me wrong, Ubisoft, please!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Short answer?  Not a lot.  I find myself in the post-epic lull that tends to happen to me after I&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/04/18/gamer-diary-mass-effect-3/">powered through a great big game </a>all the way through &#8211; I end up just being a bit frazzled.  This has lasted longer than usual, possibly because I find myself in the odd position of having actually read a book.  That sounds much more self-condescending that it ought to: what I mean is that I am terrible at finishing books &#8211; there&#8217;s a good 10-20 half-read titles populating the shelves here.  This month however, I got through a whole one, from start to finish, but this may just have something to do with my new job (in a library).</p>
<p>Why am I babbling about books?  Because I&#8217;m trying to explain, as best I can, why I haven&#8217;t done much gaming this month.  Or, at least, not much that I can bring new content to you with.  There was some more <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/04/11/gamer-diary-what-ive-been-playing-march-2012/">Kinect</a> &#8211; my parents are better at the bowling game than I am &#8211; and some other little bits and pieces like a quick foray onto <a href="http://www.tf2.com/"><strong>Team Fortress 2</strong></a> to craft weapons and hats.</p>
<p>So, my apologies for the brevity of this post!  What I did play was <strong>Portal 2</strong>, on the &#8216;Play Day&#8217; that marked the one year anniversary of its release.  I thought it&#8217;d be a good thing to write about, so I did a Google and it turned out we (BadRep) are the <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/06/13/found-feminism-portal-2-and-saints-row-2-but-not-brink/">second result</a> when you search for &#8220;Portal 2 feminist&#8221;.</p>
<div id="attachment_10777" style="width: 513px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Google-BR.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10777" data-attachment-id="10777" data-permalink="/2012/05/09/gamer-diary-what-ive-been-playing-april-2012/google-br/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Google-BR.png?fit=839%2C322&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="839,322" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Google Results: Portal 2 feminist" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Google-BR.png?fit=300%2C115&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Google-BR.png?fit=839%2C322&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-10777 " src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Google-BR.png?resize=503%2C193" alt="A screen shot of a Google search results for term &quot;Portal 2 feminist&quot; and a link to a Bad Reputation article as the second in the list." width="503" height="193" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Google-BR.png?w=839&amp;ssl=1 839w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Google-BR.png?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Google-BR.png?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w" sizes="(max-width: 503px) 100vw, 503px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-10777" class="wp-caption-text">Look! There we are! Second in the results!</p></div>
<p>I also had a gander at that top link and presented my counter-argument over on my own blog <a title="The Talking Automaton: Portal 2" href="http://thetalkingautomaton.wordpress.com/2012/04/19/portal2/" target="_blank">here</a>, which some of you who follow us <a href="http://twitter.com/badrepuk">on Twitter</a> might have already seen.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t want to simply regurgitate what I&#8217;ve already written elsewhere all over BR, which is why this is such a short post, but if I may, I&#8217;ll show you what I&#8217;m excited for in the upcoming Gaming Future.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Portal 2</strong>: <a title="YouTube: Perpetual Testing Initiative" href="http://youtu.be/b7rZO2ACP3A" target="_blank">Aperture Perpetual Testing Initiative</a> &#8211; May 8th</li>
<li><strong>Diablo III</strong> &#8211; <a title="YouTube: Diablo III cinematic trailer" href="http://youtu.be/EgbUSsblCSQ" target="_blank">Finally being released</a>(!) and I&#8217;m looking forward to playing as some of those <a title="YouTube: Diablo 3 Demon Hunter Trailer" href="http://youtu.be/8scZZfU9Zh8" target="_blank">kick-ass looking fem-versions</a> <em>(apart from those stupid heels, ugh, seriously?!)</em> &#8211; May 15th (UK)</li>
<li><strong>Max Payne 3</strong> &#8211; More for the technology than the<em> (totally original &#8211; hurhur)</em> <a title="YouTube: Max Payne 3 Trailer #2" href="http://youtu.be/JTPRPr15sW0" target="_blank">damsel-in-distress</a> storyline &#8211; May 15th</li>
</ul>
<p>Later on, there&#8217;s also <a title="Borderlands 2 Launch Date Trailer" href="http://youtu.be/MCWJUSulnro" target="_blank"><strong>Borderlands 2</strong></a> which I&#8217;m looking forward to, and <a title="Crysis 3 trailer" href="http://youtu.be/g5NNkyDt65w" target="_blank"><strong>Crysis 3</strong></a> but I have to finish <strong>Crysis 2</strong> first &#8211; oops!  I&#8217;ll also endeavour to play something a bit less, er&#8230; shooty and more casual, for those of you out there who don&#8217;t really do the FPS thing.  Hopefully I&#8217;ll get some new tech over the summer to help on that front.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll also be writing up some interesting posts about humour and gender in games, and I might do some &#8216;case study&#8217; style posts on some of the prominent female characters out there.  I&#8217;ll do my best to bring you more exciting tales next month!</p>
