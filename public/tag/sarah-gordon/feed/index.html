<p>She&#8217;s pretty well known, but deserves a mention anyway. I love the glimpse into (predominantly female) costume history I get from <strong><a href="http://drawthisdress.tumblr.com/">Draw This Dress</a></strong> &#8211; a shared project with award-winning fellow illustrator <a href="http://verabee.com/"><strong>Vera Brosgol</strong></a>. Her Valentine&#8217;s day comic last year, <a href="http://www.emcarroll.com/comics/anu/page01.html"><strong>Anu-Anulan and Yir&#8217;s Daughter</strong></a>, featured a lovely romance between two women (well, one&#8217;s a goddess, but anyway). Folklore-influenced <a href="http://emcarroll.com/comics/haresbride.html"><strong>The Hare&#8217;s Bride</strong></a> has a beautiful Carteresque simplicity to it. I love her work, and you should too.</p>

<p>I mentioned Sarah in the last post &#8211; working as colourist, she&#8217;s one third of <strong><a href="http://thepeckhaminvalids.com/">The Peckham Invalids</a></strong> team along with <a href="http://howardhardiman.com/">Howard Hardiman</a> and <a href="http://juliascheeleartblog.tumblr.com/">Julia Scheele</a>. Her blog is a great read and her art is beautiful. The above wonderfully snooty lady is her own take on one of the characters from the comic.  She says: <em>&#8220;I&#8217;d like 2012 to be a year where I stop hiding all my personal/story work in my head, notebooks and sketchbooks and get it out onto&#8230; the internet&#8221;</em>. That really struck a chord with me, because my own situation is very similar.<sup><a href="/2012/02/14/another-illustration-interlude/#footnote_0_9710" id="identifier_0_9710" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" I&rsquo;ll get around to talking about the team and what we&rsquo;ve been drawing at some point. I want to talk about these awesome people first, but if you&rsquo;re curious, trumpet-blowing will happen. I&rsquo;m, er, shy. ">1</a></sup> So I wanted to cheer Sarah on. Hope that&#8217;s not too weird. Uh. Yeah! Go Sarah, from a total stranger! And now, dear reader, you must go and Do Similarly.</p>

<p>Thought I&#8217;d go a bit more longstanding &#8211; Patrice is pretty established, but she is also awesome, so if you aren&#8217;t familiar, here she is. Her work is soft-edged and has a kind of instant, gentle appeal &#8211; she&#8217;s done a lot of popular children&#8217;s books and resources for schools, but has a lifelong passion for comics. She&#8217;s worked with Philip Pullman and <strong>Horrible Histories</strong> and on <strong>The Snowman</strong> (CHILDHOOD NOSTALGIA WIBBLY ALERT) and has signed up to draw a story for new children&#8217;s weekly comic <a href="http://www.thephoenixcomic.co.uk/blog/what-is-the-phoenix-comic/"><strong>The Phoenix</strong></a>. Hurrah for getting children into comics! (TANGENT: Check out <a href="http://www.thephoenixcomic.co.uk/blog/strips/pirates-of-pangaea/">this sword-wielding art</a> for one of the other stories. I&#8217;d have loved that as a kid. I hope the story&#8217;s as good as Neill Cameron&#8217;s art makes it look.) The other reason I want her on this post is she&#8217;s <a href="http://www.ladiesmakingcomics.com/post/17380073166/blackhistorymonth-profile-friday-patrice-aggs-is">apparently quoted here</a><sup><a href="/2012/02/14/another-illustration-interlude/#footnote_1_9710" id="identifier_1_9710" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" At least, I think this is a quote? I wasn&rsquo;t completely clear, if I&rsquo;m honest. But it&rsquo;s great advice, either from her, or inspired by her work. So there you go. ">2</a></sup> over on <a href="http://www.ladiesmakingcomics.com/">Ladies Making Comics</a> as follows: <em>&#8220;Do-it-yourself is far duller than do-it-together. We need to champion each other. Drag the male-dominated blinkered attitude into the dustbin.&#8221;</em> </p>
<p>Wise words indeed.</p>

<em>&#8220;Chloe Noonan is a monster hunter, but she doesn&#8217;t have any powers. She can&#8217;t beat up bad guys, she can&#8217;t run without getting a stitch. She&#8217;s kinda flakey and really not bothered about saving the world. Plus she has to get the bus everywhere. I know, right?!&#8221;</em></p>
<p>I love Marc Ellerby&#8217;s clean lines and eye for detail. His monsters are bloody excellent &#8211; you can feel how much fun he&#8217;s had dreaming them up. Also, no one draws an <em>unimpressed glare</em> (a favoured expression of mine, naturally, as a Strident Feminist Blog Editor) quite like him. So of course, I&#8217;m now madly in love with <strong>Chloe Noonan</strong>, his wonderfully indignant teen monster hunter heroine. She&#8217;s amazing. She hurls bombs at monsters and plays in a band whilst loudly cursing both vocations and her schoool-friend sidekick is pretty cool too (also, female: BOOM BOOM BECHDEL BUST). Check her out. Buy the comics. DO IT NOW. That is all.</p>

<p>You know, I <em>still</em> don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m done. There is so much visual awesome out there. There&#8217;s a huge stream of female creators and artists and a rich seam of great heroines, characters, and attempts at inclusive projects out there. They need shouting about as much as possible. While we&#8217;re here, though not all my choices on this list are female creators, the women who work in comics, for example (and I know I&#8217;ve I&#8217;ve not really differentiated &#8216;illustration&#8217; from &#8216;comics&#8217; here, but anyway) give the lie to defensive statements <a href="http://splinister.com/post/kapow-ignores-women-again">on why women are so frequently left off panels at events</a>, and so on. They&#8217;re around. You just have to look around you.</p>
<p>For further inspiration for the budding artists out there, I leave you with this photo of Patrice Aggs in action.<sup><a href="/2012/02/14/another-illustration-interlude/#footnote_2_9710" id="identifier_2_9710" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" If you took it, I hope you do not mind.

					<description><![CDATA[This, though, is a post about illustrators I (and Team BadRep) are digging at the moment.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello, I&#8217;m Miranda and I am into illustration.</p>
<p>Illustration &#8211; or, as Wikipedia rather charmingly defines it, art <em>created to elucidate or dictate sensual information</em> &#8211; is really important to me. It&#8217;s basically what I would do <em>all the time</em> if I had my way. And I&#8217;m not the only arty person on Team BadRep, either, <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/tag/markgrafs-movie-adventures/">as you</a> <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/category/alphabet/">may know</a>. One of the things I&#8217;ve enjoyed most about being part of this site, in fact, is the opportunities it has raised for me to discover new illustrators from around the world, including <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/05/09/fairy-tale-fest-the-best-adaptation-of-the-little-mermaid-ive-ever-seen/">feminist Gond tribal art</a> and <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/11/03/parcel-from-india/">east Indian Mithili art</a>. As I write this, I&#8217;m awaiting my copy of <a href="http://www.tarabooks.com/blog/?p=791"><strong>Sita&#8217;s Ramayana</strong> from Tara Books</a>, so I&#8217;ll be talking about that on here soon.</p>
<p>This, though, is a quick post about illustrators I&#8217;m especially digging this minute. Each of them has done some work that I found interesting and beautiful with the added dimension that it also got my feminist braincogs turning, or straight up made me smile.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll probably come back to this topic every so often, but to start with here&#8217;s some people you should check out.</p>

I am <em>fangirlishly</em> proud that this site is on her links page, I can tell you! My favourite thing she&#8217;s done is probably <strong>Keha</strong> (The Ring) which is about growing up, falling in love, and boxing, but her zines are also beautiful.</p>

<p><em>What Lengths would you be prepared to go to?</em><br />
So I met Howard at a small press art fair Markgraf and I had a stall at, and I picked up issues 1 and 2 of his comic <strong>The Lengths</strong>. It&#8217;s now on issue 5. In his own words (quoted <a href="http://forbiddenplanet.co.uk/blog/2011/the-lengths-issue-2/">here</a>), &#8220;&#8230;it’s a comic based around a series of interviews I did with male escorts working in London a few years ago and tells the story of Eddie, one young escort&#8230; who’s struggling with trying to do the job while craving both the adventure it offers him and the prospect of a relationship with an old friend&#8221;.</p>
<p>It is also very good. It&#8217;s a thoughtful, introspective comic, meandering poignantly through ideas around sex work and attitudes to it, selfhood and masculinities. I really like his decision to portray all the characters as human/dog hybrids. It just works. </p>
<p>On another tack, Howard&#8217;s also writing <strong>The Peckham Invalids</strong>, talking of which, scroll down!</p>
<p>(Oh, and according to his <a href="http://howardhardiman.com/about/">site bio</a>, he&#8217;s been described by <strong>Simply Knitting</strong> magazine as &#8220;suave&#8221;. This has really only made us dig him more.)</p>

There&#8217;s a lot about Julia&#8217;s work I love &#8211; short mini-comics like <a href="http://juliascheeleartblog.tumblr.com/post/16118992638/single-ladies-2012">this</a> and <a href="http://juliascheeleartblog.tumblr.com/post/16118961723/things-that-make-me-anxious-2012">this</a>, for example. I&#8217;d recommend following her work generally, but I&#8217;d particularly recommend <strong>The Peckham Invalids</strong>. I have issue 1, and it&#8217;s off to a promising start. The entire premise is a Bechdel-busting pile of badass, and features <a href="http://thepeckhaminvalids.com/?p=72">women from</a> <a href="http://thepeckhaminvalids.com/?p=76">a range</a> <a href="http://thepeckhaminvalids.com/?p=62">of ages</a> <a href="http://thepeckhaminvalids.com/?p=66">and backgrounds</a>, y&#8217;know, having their stories told, and stuff.<br />
<em>In 1906, as Britain surges on a tide of industrialisation driven by the brave innovations of the boldest and the best, Ms York has opened the doors of her modest home in Peckham. A group of poor, young, ill-educated, disabled and abandoned girls found their way to her and under her auspices are learning about the power they have feared the most in the world of oppression and stark inequality: their own.</em><br />
So, to recap: <em>a comic about disabled teenage superheroines in 1906 Peckham.</em> My interest is hugely piqued, my hopes are high, and the art is looking great. </p>

<p><em>&#8220;I&#8217;m pretty sure that tiny, irrationally furious, pompously indignant animals are the funniest things on the planet.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>And who are we to argue?</p>
<p>Cat&#8217;s just launched her Etsy store this week, which is great, because the image above is surely the greatest alt-Valentines card imaginable (although <a href="http://wangleberry.tumblr.com/post/16489105903/well-here-are-two-of-the-four-card-designs"><em>Snails In Love&#8230; Totally Gross</em></a> is surely a contender). I am particularly jealous of her command of facial expressions, and particularly enamoured of this image of <a href="http://wangleberry.tumblr.com/post/15475163066/these-fuzzy-little-guys-are-always-around-but">the rainbow creatures that live in puddles</a>.</p>
<p>I am in the process of loudly petitioning her to produce a picture book or a comic. Pray add your voice to the clamour, and purchase a card on your way out.</p>
