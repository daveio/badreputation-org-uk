										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello to all our new visitors! Happy Friday. If you haven&#8217;t read us before, check out the links on the right for movie reviews, <strong>Unsung Heroes</strong>, <strong>Found Feminism</strong>, our <strong>Alphabet of Feminism</strong>, and us generally <A href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/06/06/found-feminism-what-science-fiction-means/" />being excitable at sharks with lasers on their heads.</a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Girl Wonder</strong>&#8216;s latest project is &#8220;<a href="http://nomoreinvisiblegirls.tumblr.com/" />No more Invisible Girls</a>&#8220;. They&#8217;re asking for feedback and stories from female comics fans &#8211; &#8220;Raising the visibility of women who love superhero comics, one post at a time&#8221;. Really great personal stories from readers!
<li>We do our feminism with a side of Pop-Culture, and quite often something will come up which reminds us why. Here it is. <A href="http://coelasquid.tumblr.com/post/9368726757/how-media-clearly-reflects-the-sexism-and-the">This is why TV, Movies, Comics and pop-culture are important, dammit.</a>
<li>Found on <A href="http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2011/08/18/against-giving-women-the-right-to-vote-the-case-of-massachusetts/" />Sociological Images</a>, here is an incredible <A href="http://trabasack.visibli.com/share/2DvzHy">1915 newspaper advert opposing giving women the vote.</a> You know who wants women to vote? Socialists! Mormons! Don&#8217;t push politics onto women who don&#8217;t want it! Think of the Divorce rate! Amazing.
<li>Back in May Ken Clarke spoke on a radio show about rape, and said that some types were &#8220;serious rape&#8221;. As opposed to the other types, including date-rape. (He&#8217;s the Secretary of State for Justice, by the way). Mumsnet did a <A href="http://www.mumsnet.com/Talk/_chat/1282091-The-entirely-unofficial-MN-rape-and-sexual-assault-survey-RESULTS">quick straw poll</a> and were completely unprepared for the response they got.<br />
(Found via <A href="http://bidisha-online.blogspot.com/2011/08/on-rape.html">Bidisha</a>: &#8220;<em>I &#8211; we &#8211; have tried everything. Rage, wit, sorrow, entreaty, rhetoric, statistics, events, pie charts, festivals, conferences, petitions, demonstrations, articles, activities, education, campaigns, art. We have given our life&#8217;s energy to achieve one simple thing: we want to be believed. The only thing I can think of to do now is beg. We are not liars. We have never been liars. We have not made a mistake. We didn&#8217;t misread the signs. We are not confused&#8230;&#8221;</em>)</p>
<li>Chile is in the middle of serious unrest, as the government violently responds to <A href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/aug/24/chile-student-leader-camila-vallejo">female student leader Camila Vallejo</a>. She&#8217;s calling for an end to their system of elite education hardly anyone can afford, and terrible education for the rest. This has moved into brutal territory very fast &#8211; tear gas, beatings of children and students, and ministers calling for Vallejo to be assassinated. The whole country just shut down for two days as public-sector workers joined the students. &#8220;Commander Camila&#8221; has become the voice of the Chilean youth, asking for the right to education they&#8217;d been promised.
