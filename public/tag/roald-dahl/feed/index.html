<p>It was at once a brilliant and thoroughly embarrassing afternoon.</p>
<p>I came home exhausted and tearful, clutching a new book and my partner&#8217;s sleeve.  &#8220;But I can&#8217;t write about that!&#8221; I protested.  &#8220;What would I draw for it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hello, BadRep readers.  I&#8217;m here to tell you about the time I embarrassed myself in a museum.</p>

<p>I live in Cambridge, which is a nice place, and contains the Fitzwilliam Museum, which is also nice.  Startlingly nice, in fact.  Long warrens of gold-framed paintings, glass cabinets full of glittering treasures, and ancient wooden tables polished to a mirror sheen with little toblerone notices on them telling you to keep your paws off, thank you.</ul>
<p>There&#8217;s marble busts that I could look at for years and never get old, myriad hoards of coins, terrible thorny ranks of daggers and swords, medieval Christian bling and a glorious rotating selection of temporary exhibitions.</p>
<p>Their temporary exhibitions are spectacular.  They recently had one on Chinese tomb treasures that I saw posters for when I was visiting London.  &#8220;I&#8217;ve been to that!&#8221; I exclaimed, pointing at a poster on the Tube.  But no-one was impressed, for they were cultured London types with the British Museum on their doorstep, and I am a scruffy Cambridge yokel with orange hair and visible underpants.</p>
<p>The most recent standout exhibit &#8211; which was so busy they had to implement a timed ticket system &#8211; was the <a href="http://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/whatson/exhibitions/article.html?3680" target="_blank"><strong>Quentin Blake: Drawn By Hand</strong></a> exhibition.</p>
<p>You all know who <strong>Quentin Blake</strong> is, of course.  He illustrated all of <strong>Roald Dahl&#8217;s</strong> books for children and many other things besides.  I wasn&#8217;t very familiar with his &#8220;many other things besides&#8221;, though, and that was what this exhibit showed me.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t know, for example, that he has done public paintings for hospitals.  There were many of his maternity-unit paintings, all involving cheerful mothers having fun in a variety of scenes (some are <a href="http://quentinblake.com/gallery/hospitals/item/344-2011sallesdebain1-100x100cm" target="_blank">underwater for a water-birthing unit</a>) and all very sweet and soothing to look at.</p>
<p>And there was this one that made me lose my shit comprehensively.</p>
<p>I was already on delicate emotional footing because I have a lot of feelings about Quentin Blake, and then I came across this painting he&#8217;d done for the Vincent Square eating disorder treatment unit in London.</p>
<p>The painting, titled <strong>Ordinary Life No. 8</strong>, is of <a href="http://quentinblake.com/gallery/hospitals/item/334-2010edu8" target="_blank">a young woman in her hospital room in a gown</a>, feeding birds on her windowsill through the open sash window.  She looks happy, and all the birds are eating seeds.</p>
<p>This just in: I have just started crying writing that paragraph.</p>
<p>I am at work.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s in her room, where she has to stay until she&#8217;s better, but the birds can go where they please; she is happy to feed the birds, and the birds are happy to be fed.  Oh my god, there are so many things in that piece that kind of punched me in the heart until I burst into a fire hydrant of noisy tears in the middle of the reflective silence of the exhibit.</p>
<p>Some very well-behaved children turned around and scowled at me.  My partner ushered me on.  The next piece was <a href="http://standpointmag.co.uk/files/blake3.jpg" target="_blank">from the lithograph series <strong>Girls and Dogs</strong></a>, of a young girl in a red dress, happily showing a gigantic pitch-black terrifying-looking wolf monster a painting she&#8217;d done.  The tears came again, only worse.</p>
<p>And then, at the end, there was an illustration for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boy_in_the_Dress" target="_blank"><strong>The Boy In The Dress</strong></a> (a children&#8217;s novel by <strong>David Walliams</strong>, of all people) and it was all too much and I had to leave.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mummy,&#8221; said a small child with crisp, angelic gold ringlets bearing aloft a blue ribbon, &#8220;That man is crying&#8221;.</p>
<p>Blake&#8217;s paintings, with their characteristic loose, expressive style &#8211; fluid washes of watercolour and ink contained by haphazard spidery cages of scratchy black ink somehow conspiring to be more life-accurate than anything photorealism could ever offer &#8211; capture and reflect simple happiness and freedom.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to use words like &#8220;innocence&#8221;, because I don&#8217;t like its implications of fetishising a lack of knowledge.  Blake&#8217;s paintings are very canny; their veneer of simplicity disguising a great depth of self-awareness and knowledge of the subject.</p>
<p>The young girl showing the big wolf her painting isn&#8217;t afraid of the big wolf.  The big wolf likes her painting, and looms in front of her with giant, masonry-nail fangs bared in an appreciative grin.  She has nothing to fear from her playmate, however, because she is brave and has made friends with something that others would find terrifying and avoid.</p>
<p>The young woman in her hospital room is finding joy in feeding the birds.  The birds don&#8217;t know why she&#8217;s in hospital, or of her own difficulties with food; they just like seeds and she&#8217;s put some out for them.</p>
<p>I bought a copy of <strong>The Boy In The Dress</strong> on the way home.  An entire exhibition of mostly women, magic and birds and I end up with a book about a boy who likes to wear dresses.  That&#8217;s top marketing, that.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll let you know how it is.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SPOILER ALERT: You really ought to have seen <strong>Psycho</strong> by now but on the offchance you haven&#8217;t I shall be giving away the twist at the end. Likewise Roald Dahl&#8217;s superb short story <strong>The Landlady</strong>, but you can read it quickly <a href="http://www.nexuslearning.net/books/holt-eol2/collection 3/landlady.htm">here</a>.</p>
<h3>My taxidermy adventure</h3>
<p class="mceTemp">After reading about <a href="http://www.amandasautopsies.com/"><strong>Amanda&#8217;s Autopsies</strong></a> taxidermy workshops on the fabulous <strong><a href="http://www.mookychick.co.uk/how-to/interesting-hobbies/amandas-autopsies-taxiderny-workshop.php">Mookychick</a> </strong>I signed up for the next one as quick as you could say “lifelong interest in stuffed animals”. Our victims: guinea pigs.</p>
<div id="attachment_12379" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Photo-on-16-09-2012-at-15.37-5.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12379" data-attachment-id="12379" data-permalink="/2012/09/21/taxidermy-women-and-horror/photo-on-16-09-2012-at-15-37-5/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Photo-on-16-09-2012-at-15.37-5.jpg?fit=1080%2C720&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1080,720" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="SJ with Boudica G Pig" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Photo-on-16-09-2012-at-15.37-5.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Photo-on-16-09-2012-at-15.37-5.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-12379" title="SJ with Boudica G Pig" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Photo-on-16-09-2012-at-15.37-5-300x200.jpg?resize=300%2C200" alt="Sarah holds up a stuffed guinea pig in a Boudica costume, looks dubious" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Photo-on-16-09-2012-at-15.37-5.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Photo-on-16-09-2012-at-15.37-5.jpg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Photo-on-16-09-2012-at-15.37-5.jpg?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-12379" class="wp-caption-text">Me with Boudica G. Pig</p></div>
<p>The workshop was fascinating, absorbing, and not as gruesome as I had feared. Having been frozen and bashed about a bit, my subject (who I&#8217;ve since named Boudica) didn&#8217;t look anything like a live guinea pig when I met it, so its <em>thingness</em> made it surprisingly easy to cut into.</p>
<p>Although I&#8217;m a big fan of badly stuffed animals, from the famous <a href="http://www.horniman.ac.uk/collections/browse/object/190371">Horniman Walrus</a> to the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Badly-Stuffed-Animals/325523944124623">facebook page</a> du jour, following the workshop I have a newfound respect for the taxidermist&#8217;s art. Taking the skin off was reasonably straightforward, but my god it&#8217;s difficult to get the creature into the right shape.</p>
<p>But I was reasonably pleased with the result, and Boudica G. Pig proudly adorns my mantelpiece. At some point I need to get her a spear, helmet and tiny chariot but that&#8217;s a project for another day.</p>
<h3>Women wield the scalpel</h3>
<p>Interestingly, as well as the glamorous Amanda herself and her assistant on the day I&#8217;d estimate that the workshop participants were nearly all women. Taxidermy is clearly kinda fashionable at the moment, and although I can&#8217;t say it was at the top of my equality agenda I&#8217;m pleased that women are getting stuck in.</p>
<p>As noted on the brilliant <a href="http://www.ravishingbeasts.com/">website</a> of academic Rachel Poliquin who has just written a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Breathless-Zoo-Taxidermy-Animalibus/dp/0271053720">book</a> about taxidermy, there are a surprising number of stuffed animals finding their way into contemporary art. I first heard about <a href="http://pollymorgan.co.uk/">Polly Morgan</a>&#8216;s work a few years ago, but there&#8217;s also <a href="http://www.ravishingbeasts.com/taxidermy-artists/2011/9/9/well-they-were-death-anyways.html">Merel Bekking,</a> <a href="http://www.claire-morgan.co.uk/">Claire Morgan</a>, and the incredibly disturbing work of <a href="http://www.kateclark.com/">Kate Clark</a>.</p>
<p>There are even signs that the tired old <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TaxidermyIsCreepy">TV trope</a> of taxidermy as a hobby for creepy men is being eroded, with a friendly, sympathetic taxidermist as a central character in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0427152/">Dinner for Schmucks</a> and even a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1468313/">sexy indie flick</a> with a kooky girl taxidermist as the romantic lead.</p>
<h3>Creepy cool</h3>
<p>That said, no matter how cool it becomes I doubt taxidermy will ever stop being creepy altogether. Firstly because it makes you think of death. Stuffed animals act as a kind of hipster memento mori. Secondly because part of taxidermy&#8217;s appeal (particularly as part of an artwork) is its uncanny effect, the ambiguity of animate or inanimate, alive or dead. And finally because taxidermy is so firmly lodged in the symbolic language of horror, where it also takes on a fascinating gendered aspect.</p>

<div></div>
<p>As <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TaxidermyTerror">TV Tropes</a> notes most haunted houses, villain lairs, and cabins in the wood contain a trophy deer head with antlers that cast eerie shadows, or a stuffed owl, wolf or bear with glinting eyes and gleaming teeth. Whether predator or prey these creatures provide a handy visual signal for danger to the audience (and occasionally the protagonist) and get them meditating on the theme of death.</p>
<h3>Taxidermy and patriarchy</h3>
<p>But there&#8217;s also a number of influential horror films that contain some form of human taxidermy as an especially unsettling treat, most of which draw some of their grisly inspiration from the sickening &#8216;trophies&#8217; of real life serial killer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Gein">Ed Gein</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.albany.edu/scj/jcjpc/vol2is4/horror.html">The Horror of Everyday Life: Taxidermy, Aesthetics, and Consumption in Horror Films</a> Jeffrey Niesel argues that taxidermy in horror films is often used as a way to silence feminine subjectivity. He quotes from Jane Caputi&#8217;s book <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6naKaWROJ0gC&amp;lpg=PA158&amp;ots=6LkIcNOyWc&amp;dq=the age of sex crime&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"><strong>The Age of Sex Crime</strong></a>, in which she argues that sexual serial killings, far from being &#8216;deviant&#8217;, represent the logic of patriarchy taken to an especially brutal extreme:</p>
<blockquote><p>Serial sexual murder is not some inexplicable explosion/epidemic of an extrinsic evil or the domain only of the mysterious psychopath. On the contrary, such murder is an eminently logical step in the procession of patriarchal values, needs, and rule of force.</p></blockquote>
<p>For Niesel, “taxidermy represents the most literal expression of male violence, and reveals both the violence and the ultimate instability located at the core of a patriarchal system that relies on validation from passive feminine subjects.” He views taxidermy in <strong>Psycho</strong>, <strong>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</strong> and <strong>The Silence of the Lambs</strong> as an expression of the crisis of masculinity as Norman Bates, the Sawyer family and Buffalo Bill strive to possess women while silencing their subjectivity, turning them into objects. As Niesel observes, “a stuffed woman is the perfect woman because her male companion can make her say whatever he wants.”</p>
<h3>&#8220;As harmless as one of these stuffed birds&#8221;</h3>

<p>I&#8217;ll share some of his thoughts on <strong>Psycho</strong>, because it&#8217;s my favourite, and because it features animal <em>and</em> human taxidermy, hooray! In <strong>Psycho</strong> the connection between women and &#8220;stuffed birds&#8221; is made pretty clear. Norman tells Marion that “you eat like a bird&#8221; and shortly afterwards describes his mother as being &#8220;as harmless as one of those stuffed birds&#8221;, a comparison &#8216;she&#8217; herself makes later. He also tells Marion “I think only birds look well stuffed because they&#8217;re kind of passive to begin with.” As Niesel points out:</p>
<blockquote><p>Birds are not really any more or less active or passive than other creatures, but his statement resonates throughout the film because it describes the way women are treated. Women are expected to be stuffed birds, and there is a constant tension involved in trying to enforce their &#8220;passivity.&#8221; Women pose a threat in the film because they might do something like steal $40,000 (as Marion does)</p></blockquote>
<p>I particularly like Niesel&#8217;s reading of the moment when Lila Crane finally confronts the stuffed Mrs Bates: she is in fact confronting the full horror of violent suppression of female agency and subjectivity. She is facing herself. Well no wonder it always makes me jump.</p>
<h3>Turning the tables</h3>
<p>Applying Niesel&#8217;s analysis to one of my very favourite examples of taxidermy in popular culture, Roald Dahl&#8217;s short story <a href="http://www.nexuslearning.net/books/holt-eol2/collection 3/landlady.htm"><strong>The Landlady</strong></a> (published in 1959, a year before <strong>Psycho</strong> was released) gave me an insight into why it&#8217;s so incredibly effective. It&#8217;s not just the chill as you realise that the unnamed landlady is a serial killer with a penchant for human taxidermy, but her tremendous gender transgression in being so. She collects handsome young men, and wants the protagonist, Billy, as her latest possession. She even eyes him up in an objectifying gesture that will be familiar to most women on the planet:</p>
<blockquote><p>“And it is such a pleasure, my dear, such a very great pleasure when now and again I open the door and I see someone standing there who is just exactly right.” She was halfway up the stairs, and she paused with one hand on the stair rail, turning her head and smiling down at him with pale lips. “Like you,” she added, and her blue eyes traveled slowly all the way down the length of Billy’s body, to his feet, and then up again.</p></blockquote>
<p>Even though he can see she&#8217;s a bit unhinged Billy&#8217;s mistake is to assume that she is harmless (“there was no question about that”) because she is a middle-aged woman. He is not prepared for such a dramatic reversal in their gender roles, from predator to prey, from subject to object.</p>
