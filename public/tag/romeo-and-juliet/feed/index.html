<p>Ahem. <em>Yes </em>is the last of our Old English words. It&#8217;s <em>gise </em>or <em>gese, </em>meaning &#8216;so be it&#8217;, perhaps from <em>gea, ge </em>(= &#8216;so&#8217;), plus <em>si</em> (=&#8217;be it!&#8217;), the third person imperative of <em>beon</em> (= &#8216;to be&#8217;). In this form, <em>yes</em> was stronger than its Germanic cognate, <em>yea </em>(much like today) and, apparently, was often used in Shakespeare as an answer to negative questions. We could do with one of them nowadays, no? How many times have you answered a question with <em>yes </em>when you mean <em>no</em>? (&#8216;Doesn&#8217;t she&#8230;.?&#8217; &#8216;&#8230;Yes, she doesn&#8217;t&#8217;).</p>
<p>The penultimate word in our Alphabet, <em>yes </em>is frequently one of the first words we learn on earth; its meaning is clear and unequivocal, by turns disastrous, passionate, exhilarating, loaded and humdrum &#8211; but always positive in the full sense of that word. It is almost invariably repeated, as in Joyce (and Usher) &#8211; &#8216;yes I will, Yes&#8217;, the successive affirmations underlining and confirming the first &#8211; just like a <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=W7eLlRE-5OwC&amp;pg=PA253&amp;lpg=PA253&amp;dq=ulysses+gramophone+hear+say+yes+in+joyce&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OCKYHR7yyY&amp;sig=Y5Za4Hwk3Sfp2sFGKGxS0xR5Nfw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=9MbzTNvyEOCAhAfmrJCLDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=ulysses%20gramophone%20hear%20say%20yes%20in%20joyce&amp;f=false">signature</a> under your printed name, if you listen to Derrida</p>
<h3>Sure &#8216;Nuff n&#8217; Yes I Do</h3>
<p>James &#8216;<a href="http://www.bedeutung.co.uk/theblog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/james_joyce.jpg">Awesome Glasses</a>&#8216; Joyce apparently made much of his novel &#8216;novel&#8217; <strong>Ulysses</strong> ending on this, which he considered &#8216;the female word&#8217;. The final chapter, &#8216;Penelope&#8217;, often also referred to as &#8216;Molly Bloom&#8217;s soliloquy&#8217;, is 42 pages of just eight sentences, wherein Molly, wife of Leopold Bloom, muses to herself in bed.</p>
<p>For those who have better things to do than wrestle with a modernist doorstop, as the wife of the novel&#8217;s &#8216;Ulysses&#8217;, Molly is a counterpart to &#8216;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penelope">Penelope</a>&#8216;, wife of Odysseus / Ulysses and conventional model of <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/03/28/an-alphabet-of-feminism-23-w-is-for-widow/">marital fidelity</a>. The similarity expires fairly quickly, since Joyce&#8217;s Penelope is having an affair with &#8216;Blazes Boylan&#8217;, but nonetheless her chapter is often named after Ulysses&#8217; wife. It begins and ends with this <em>yes</em>, and in a letter to Frank Budgen, Joyce explained that &#8216;Penelope&#8217; rotates around what he considered the four cardinal points of the female  body &#8211; &#8216;breasts, arse, womb and cunt&#8217; &#8211; expressed respectively by the words <em>because, bottom, woman</em> and <em>yes</em>. Some of the comparisons are clear – the <em><a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/03/14/an-alphabet-of-feminism-21-u-is-for-uterus/">womb</a></em> has long been seen as synonymous with &#8216;woman&#8217; (however reductively); <em>bottom / arse –</em> ok; <em>because / breasts&#8230; </em>um?; <em>yes / cunt – </em>hmm.</p>
<p>I suspect this last pairing has a lot to do with the affirmation of sex: interaction with this organ <strong>should</strong> be one preceded by <em>yes </em>and punctuated with repetitions of this confirmation (<em>yes yes yes</em>). (Why James Joyce, you filthy&#8230;). We see a similar thing in Usher (first time for everything): the repeated <em>yeah, yeah, yeah </em>is a sexual affirmation – &#8216;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiXbRBS5Z58">How the hell am I supposed to leave??</a>&#8216;. This is about a female seduction (&#8216;she&#8217;s saying &#8220;come get me&#8221;!&#8217;), but one that we suspect will not end in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCss0kZXeyE">when-i&#8217;m-sixty-four</a> style knitting by the fire. For one thing, we learn that Usher already has a &#8216;<a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/11/15/an-alphabet-of-femininism-7-g-is-for-girl/">girl</a>&#8216;, who happens to be &#8216;the best of homies&#8217; with this club seductress; for another, Ludacris announces they will leave after a couple of drinks because they &#8216;want a <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/12/20/an-alphabet-of-femininism-12-l-is-for-lady/">lady</a> in the street but a freak in the bed&#8217;. So actually, the art of being a <em>lady </em>lies in effectively concealing a consent that, in private, becomes loud, repeated and unstoppable.</p>
<h3>Yes Indeed</h3>

The 'Easy Girlfriend' Poster, 1943-4</p></div>
<p>This is a well-trodden path, and all part of the old idea of how consent given too easily (<em>yes yes yes</em>) – or, in some cases, even given at all – is liable to get females into trouble. A less well-trodden example is Richardson&#8217;s <strong>Sir Charles Grandison </strong>(1753), which devotes several hundred of its thousand or so pages to what happens after the protagonist has proposed to his fiance: though she has accepted the proposal, she fears that to &#8216;name the day&#8217; herself – or even to consent to a &#8216;day&#8217; suggested to her – would be to show a forwardness disturbing in a woman. Disturbing perhaps, but probably a relief to the exhausted reader, for she manages to suspend her final consent to &#8216;thursday a month hence&#8217; for an entire blushing, confused volume of this hefty tome.</p>
<p>We can go further back, of course: in Shakespeare-times, Juliet fears Romeo will think she is &#8216;too quickly won&#8217;. To correct this, she offers to &#8216;frown, and be perverse, and say thee <em>nay</em>&#8216; (<em>no no yes</em>), artificially constructing a well-won consent where positive affirmation already exists (history does not record whether or not Juliet was &#8216;a freak in the bed&#8217;). Many would-be Romeos have seized on such fears to assume (or convince themselves) that this is just what their ladies are doing when they give an unequivocal &#8216;no&#8217;, so seduction narratives are littered with lovers assuming their lovers really mean <em>yes </em>when they reply in the negative<em> – </em>examples have spanned Austen&#8217;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWx7AF8B0R8&amp;feature=related">Mr Collins</a> to modern day Mills &amp; Boon. Apparently, in the latter case, one is supposed to find this irresistible.</p>
<h3>Go No More A-Roving</h3>
<p>We&#8217;re teetering around something rather insidious here, and one aspect of this finds its expression in a 1940s propaganda poster. The &#8216;Easy Girlfriend&#8217; anti-VD advert placed the blame for the Second World War venereal epidemic squarely with the momento-mori type be-hatted skull (a sexually experienced re-appropriation of the medieval <a href="http://www.abcgallery.com/B/baldung/baldung16.JPG">Death and the Maiden</a> trope). &#8216;The &#8220;easy&#8221; girlfriend spreads syphilis and gonorrhea&#8217;, it blazed – she who says <em>yes </em>too easily is to be shunned by polite society, and will be – <em>naturellement </em>– riddled with disease. Of course, syphilis&#8217; original spread throughout Europe had followed the path of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Tour">Grand Tour</a>, but this must have been because Venetian prostitutes were taking expensive package holidays throughout France, Spain, Rome, Switzerland and Turkey, mustn&#8217;t it, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Byron">Lord Byron</a>?</p>
<p>So while you probably disagree with Joyce&#8217;s view that <em>yes </em>is an intrinsically female word, it&#8217;s certainly one whose utterance is littered with potential problems for women. <em>Yes </em>means <em>yes. </em></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">NANNY</h2>
<h3><strong>Sonic Nurse</strong></h3>
<p>After the army of Important Academic Languages, and their Distinguished And Layered Relationship With Modern English, we reach this. <em>N</em><em>anny </em>has no real relation to Latin, Greek, French, Middle or even Old English, but derives from &#8216;a child&#8217;s corruption of the word <em>nurse</em>&#8216;, tellingly akin to <em>mamma</em>. <em>Nurse</em>, it must be granted,<em> </em>has slightly more pedigree: it derives from the twelfth-century Old French term <em>norrice</em>,<em> </em>via the Latin <em>nutricius </em>(=<em> </em>&#8216;that suckles, nourishes&#8217;). It<em> </em>first appears in 1530 as a verb &#8216;to suckle&#8217;, and as a noun fifty years later, where it has the meaning we probably use most often: &#8216;one who takes care of the sick&#8217;.</p>

<p><em>Nanny</em> is first cited as an independent word meaning &#8216;a child&#8217;s nurse-maid&#8217; in 1795, whence it proves itself as fluid as you would expect, also encompassing a quasi-proper name, <em>Nana</em> (Cf. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUhwA-C-ACg">Katy Nana</a> in <strong>Mary Poppins</strong>, and the Newfoundland dog in <strong>Peter Pan</strong>). In 1830s America, we meet another deviant form of the same idea: <em>mammy,</em> a dialect corruption of <em>mamma</em> referring to &#8216;a black woman who looks after white children&#8217;. In extended form, <em>mammy </em>refers to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammy_archetype">racial stereotype</a>: &#8216;the loud, overweight and good natured black woman&#8217;, epitomised (in proper name form) in <strong>Gone With The Wind</strong>, and controversially brought to life in an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92kLpKuRJfo">Oscar-winning performance</a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hattie_McDaniel">Hattie McDaniel</a> (above, right). And it&#8217;s not all the Americans: this phenomenon has certain similarities to the British use of native women as nursemaids in colonial India, <em>ayah</em>s, so named in reference to the Hindi word meaning &#8216;nurse&#8217;.</p>
<h3>Dude Ranch Nurse</h3>
<p>All this leads back to one place: the whistleblowing potential of an <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/11/29/an-alphabet-of-femininism-9-i-is-for-infant/">infant&#8217;s cries</a>, in this instance naming the truly maternal figure in their formative years. But then, of course, until the late eighteenth century (the nineteenth, in France), no fashionable woman would even consider nursing her own child: on the contrary, <em>wet nursing </em>(sending your kid out to be suckled by a hired breast) was so common as to be automatic. Newborns were generally sent away for up to two years to be <em>nourished</em>, at a rate of anything from a few shillings a week to between £25 &#8211; 50 a year.</p>
<p>The reasons were as varied as the price, spanning the apparently trivial (social custom, and the desire to return to public life ASAP); the medical (fears for the mother&#8217;s health after the strain of lying in <em>sans </em>twenty-first century advantages), and the &#8216;medical&#8217; (the widespread notion that sex with a nursing woman would damage her milk and therefore the child, and the belief that conception was impossible during this time anyway). It also seems possible that rampant infant mortality may have contributed: parents would send their children away until they had survived their most dangerous years, rather than invest emotional energy in a little&#8217;un who might well leave you before their first birthday.</p>
<p>That said, the enduring influence of the nanny <em>qua</em> mother-figure lasted long into the twentieth century, albeit mostly among the mega-aristocracy: <strong>The King&#8217;s Speech </strong>(2011) imagines the future George VI to have been closer to his nannies than his family; one of these, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Bill">Charlotte Bill</a>, was famously also an effective mother to his autistic and epileptic younger brother, Johnny (re-created in the 2003 BBC serial <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lost_Prince">The Lost Prince</a></strong>).</p>

<p>The women who actually did all this nursing were inevitably of a lower social class than their clients – if not a different race – although they could earn good money (and possibly a nice pension) in the process. Here we tumble into a parallel nanny universe: the word in its more formal sense originating from another <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/10/25/an-alphabet-of-femininism-4-d-is-for-doll/">proper name</a><em>. </em>Through a bit of shuffling, good old <em>Ann</em> became first <em>Nan</em> and then <em>Nanny</em>, in which incarnation, around 1788, the word came to simply connote femininity, as in <em>Nanny-goat </em>(= &#8216;a female goat&#8217;, on which see also &#8216;Jenny Wren&#8217; and &#8216;jenny-ass&#8217;). Like <em>Doll</em>, Nan&#8217;s trajectory suggests commonness, generic feminine identity, and while the dictionary is specific on the two <em>nannies</em>&#8216; separation, its stated origin in an infant&#8217;s mouth is by definition uncertain, language development fluid, and the connections between milking and the farmyard in need of little exposition – compare the nineteenth-century term <em>baby farmer</em>, a lower-class wet nurse happy to let her charges die because her one-off fee encouraged little else. The term was always pejorative, and synonymous with the dangerous, non-nurturing female.</p>
<p>In contrast, we have the <em>nannies </em>who stayed with one family for generations (like the <em>mammy</em> and the <em>ayah </em>abroad): these last are inevitably conventionally &#8216;older&#8217; than their baby-farming colleagues, and presumably played a more extended mothering role. It is these strange insider-outsiders who appear in literature as bawdy and decrepit old women, inevitably depicted as their job title suggests: firmly on the side of the children they raise, to the extent that they will happily aid their improper sexual dalliances. It is thus that the <em>Nurse</em> appears in <strong>Romeo and Juliet</strong>, and in Keats&#8217; <strong>The Eve of St. Agnes</strong>. The suspicion inevitably directed at these figures is certainly class-based: wet nursing&#8217;s detractors had been arguing for years that by withholding mothers&#8217; milk parents risked their children absorbing working-class mannerisms – and criminal tendencies – from their surrogate teats.</p>
<h3>Na na na na na.</h3>
<p>The next stop for the <em>nanny </em>is in the inter-war years, with representatives including P.L. Travers&#8217; <strong>Mary Poppins</strong>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Now_We_Are_Six">poems </a>of A. A. Milne, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noel_Streatfeild">Noel Streatfeild</a>&#8216;s legion of sexless &#8216;cottage loaf&#8217; Nanas. Streatfeild&#8217;s children are almost invariably orphaned, and their Nana-figure keeps them nourished through &#8216;nursery ways&#8217;, a stubborn lack of sentimentality, and a feeling of permanence sadly lacking in the increasingly fragmented world of war-torn Britain. A similar idea is repeated in the 1964 Disney film of Travers&#8217; novel, which makes the significant decision to backdate events to 1910, when the focus is on &#8216;moulding the breed&#8217; for future colonial greatness:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIamxYhVfnI">A British nanny must be a general! </a><br />
The future empire lies within her hands.<br />
And so the person that we need<br />
To mould the breed<br />
Is a nanny who can give commands!</p>
<p>Walt Disney&#8217;s <strong>Mary Poppins </strong>(1964)</p></blockquote>
<p>In so doing, Disney&#8217;s film situates the<em> nanny </em>as part of &#8216;tradition, discipline and rules&#8217;, nurturing Britain&#8217;s future rather than its children, and flying in the face of its very etymology.</p>
<p>Mr Banks&#8217; song does, however, lead us to the final stop on <em>nanny&#8217;</em>s childishly simple word-journey: its modern incarnation as the Dreaded <em>Nanny State </em>(first appearing some time between the fifties and sixties). Always an opprobrious term (<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4044815.stm">attempts to re-appropriate it</a> have met with derision)  critics of government intervention ranging from the welfare state to the smoking ban hark back to the <em>nanny </em>to point up &#8216;mollycoddling&#8217;, the infantalisation of the people (who are presumably thus reduced to the baby-talk of the nursery) returning to <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=F3vwrJQWukUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false">childhood with a fussy female at the helm</a>. Wash your face, dearie.</p>
