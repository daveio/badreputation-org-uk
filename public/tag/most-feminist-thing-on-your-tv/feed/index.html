										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What, Steve, ANOTHER post about the sequel to cartoon series <strong>Avatar: The Last Airbender</strong>? Why would you do such a thing?</p>
<p>Well, because given <A href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/01/11/avatar-%E2%80%93-no-the-other-one/" />how good the original was</a>, the <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/03/24/avatar-the-legend-of-korra-gets-badass-on-gender-expectations/">sequel</a> might just be the <em>Most Feminist Thing On Your TV</em> when it comes out next year.</p>
<p>Also several of team BadRep are raving fans already, so you&#8217;ll just have to put up with us jumping up and down every time they release new material. <A href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmsT63BgFPw">Which is exactly what happened when we saw this trailer</a>, which just premiered at San Diego Comic Con! </p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/jmsT63BgFPw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Produced by Nickelodeon, <strong>Avatar: The Legend of Korra</strong> is a show with the female lead character in the title. This is actually incredibly important, and of course vanishingly rare in a series which then goes on to be mostly about fighting, growing up, choosing your own path, and not pre-packaged &#8216;girl content&#8217; that some networks assume must follow from a female name on the poster. Korra is the Chosen One, not the sidekick, doing real-world martial-arts, with added fire. Buffy can claim to have done it, maybe Max in Dark Angel, but we&#8217;re still looking back for only a handful of shows in the past 20 years. </p>
<p>As for the trailer, we love that she&#8217;s the star, but a lot of our current excitement is based on how fair and equal the previous show was, while still remaining incredibly exciting and not at all preachy. If you don&#8217;t understand why the shots of statues and cities are AWESOME and IMPORTANT then that&#8217;s because you need to go and watch it!</p>
<p>We will update you when more <strong>Avatar: The Legend of Korra</strong> material shows up. (We&#8217;ll have to, because it&#8217;s the only way to get at least three of us to shut up about it.)</p>
