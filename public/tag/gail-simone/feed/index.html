										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my ongoing quest for image-and-word combinations with female characters that aren&#8217;t made of boobs in jumpsuits, I&#8217;ve been doing some trawling of the internet for webcomics for your edu-tainment. Here&#8217;s some of the best of them.</p>
<h3>Strong Female Protagonist</h3>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Strong-Female-Protagonist.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="13972" data-permalink="/2013/09/23/webcomics-to-watch-out-for-part-one/strong-female-protagonist/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Strong-Female-Protagonist.jpg?fit=684%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="684,1024" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Strong Female Protagonist" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Strong-Female-Protagonist.jpg?fit=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Strong-Female-Protagonist.jpg?fit=684%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-13972" alt="A black and white panelled comic with thick drawn line art and grey shading. A ground level image of a pair of feet in trainers walk past an angry crowd who are hurling abuse. A teenage girl in shorts and tshirt holds aloft a man in an overcoat and gasmask, demanding to know if the crowd know who he is. When they do not answer, she picks up a car and throws it. A huge, angry text bubble with NOW! appears by the wreckage." src="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Strong-Female-Protagonist-200x300.jpg?resize=200%2C300" width="200" height="300" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Strong-Female-Protagonist.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Strong-Female-Protagonist.jpg?w=684&amp;ssl=1 684w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> Yes, I found this by doing a lazy Google search after &#8220;decent webcomics that won&#8217;t make me scream&#8221; didn&#8217;t turn up anything useful. But it worked, and here we are. <a href="http://strongfemaleprotagonist.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Strong Female Protagonist</strong></a> by Brennan Lee Mulligan (writer) and <a href="http://www.mollyostertag.com/" target="_blank">Molly Ostertag</a> (art) is a superheroine comic about an American teenager trying to deal with being an ex-superhero, her former comrades and enemies, and going to university whilst still having epic superpowers.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s an X-Men-esque backdrop of mutation-hatred, and so she exists, like many superheroes, in a world that is not entirely happy about <em>having</em> superheroes. The black and white thick line art is really nice, I like the emphasis on characters&#8217; faces and expressions rather than bodies, and the themes of power, responsibility and morality are something I think the &#8220;super&#8221; genre is well-placed to tackle.</p>
<p>The main exploration is, naturally enough, about what it means to be a Strong Female Protagonist, and links neatly to <a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2013/08/i-hate-strong-female-characters" target="_blank">this nice article on the subject in the New Statesman recently</a>. Yes, the lead character is &#8220;strong&#8221; &#8211; she&#8217;s a physical powerhouse, and strong-minded too. Her strength isn&#8217;t just physical, but also emerges in terms of her blunt decision-making and clearly held beliefs about right and wrong. Strength ostensibly defines her, but the comic is about the questions and complications behind what that might mean.</p>
<h3>Delilah Dirk</h3>
<p>I was absolutely bowled over by the quality of the artwork in <a href="http://www.delilahdirk.com" target="_blank"><strong>Delilah Dirk and the Turkish Lieutenant</strong></a>. The colouration is superb, and the detail in each of the panels makes the whole thing look absolutely lush: there&#8217;s a &#8220;classic story&#8221; feel to the whole piece, and the pages, like our titular heroine, are full of life and activity.</p>
<p>The comic is set in (sort of) Constantinople in 1805, and is very much in the style of <strong>The Mummy</strong> and <strong>Adele Blanc-Sec</strong> (watch the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Extraordinary_Adventures_of_Ad%C3%A8le_Blanc-Sec_(film)" target="_blank">movie</a> now, if you haven&#8217;t). I won&#8217;t lie, I do like a good swashbuckling, wisecracking character in a gung-ho Sinbad the Sailor-style universe, where bad guys are bad and the goodies might do slightly naughty things, but it&#8217;s all in a Robin Hood sort of way.</p>
<p>This is one of those narratives: Delilah is half English, half Greek, all Action Famous Adventure Lady, and all tongues should remain in cheeks, except when they&#8217;re lolling at the beautiful landscapes of <a href="http://www.tonycliff.com/" target="_blank">Tony Cliff</a>, whose work has also graced <strong><a href="http://www.flightcomics.com/" target="_blank">Flight</a></strong>. It&#8217;s not particularly deep or meaningful, but hey, not all narratives with female characters need to be about what it is to be a female character, right? It&#8217;s definitely a damn good yarn, and worth a look for the art if nothing else.</p>
<h3>The Fox Sister</h3>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Fox-Sister-33.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="13971" data-permalink="/2013/09/23/webcomics-to-watch-out-for-part-one/foxsister_ch1_interior_redeux-indd/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Fox-Sister-33.jpg?fit=600%2C783&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="600,783" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;foxsister_ch1_interior_redeux.indd&quot;}" data-image-title="foxsister_ch1_interior_redeux.indd" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Fox-Sister-33.jpg?fit=229%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Fox-Sister-33.jpg?fit=600%2C783&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-13971 alignleft" alt="A four panel vertical comic. A woman in an overcoat steps into a darkened alleyway, the sun setting above her. The shadows darken and lengthen. After a moment, a many tailed fox with gleaming red eyes pads out of the bottom panel towards the reader." src="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Fox-Sister-33-229x300.jpg?resize=229%2C300" width="229" height="300" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Fox-Sister-33.jpg?resize=229%2C300&amp;ssl=1 229w, https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Fox-Sister-33.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w" sizes="(max-width: 229px) 100vw, 229px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>A fox-spirit comic? I don&#8217;t mind if I do.</p>
<p>Rather than the more familiar Japanese shapeshifter, <a href="http://www.thefoxsister.com/" target="_blank"><strong>The Fox Sister</strong></a> is about the Korean <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumiho" target="_blank">Kumiho</a>. It&#8217;s another gorgeously-drawn webcomic and the product of a very welcome collaboration between <a href="http://chirart.deviantart.com/" target="_blank">Jayd Aït-Kaci </a>and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina_Strain" target="_blank">Christina Strain</a>, who is departing from her usual colourist work to write this modern fairytale of two sisters.</p>
<p>The thick line-brush work and open panels sit well with the thoughtful, slow-paced writing in a landscape of snow and secrets. I love the way the fox spirit steps out of the panel on the page I&#8217;ve included here.</p>
<p>Something about the artwork reminds me of a pre-Blu-ray cleanup <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055254/" target="_blank">Disney&#8217;s <strong>101 Dalmations</strong></a>, especially in the colour palette and faces of characters, but this is not a Disney story, though the elements make it appear like it might be &#8211; we have an all-American hero, and his ongoing terrible attempts at both speaking Korean and trying to get romantic with our heroine, Yun Mee, who is far more interested in fighting the fox-demon that took over her elder sister&#8217;s life.</p>
<h3>Gunnerkrigg Court</h3>
<p>A mysterious school, in a mysterious city, by a mysterious forest, separated by a large (mysterious) moat. This is a webcomic of teenagers, demons, spirits, folktales, ghosts, robots and the usual school-related growing pains. <a href="http://www.gunnerkrigg.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Gunnerkrigg Court</strong></a> is <strong>Harry Potter</strong> meets <strong>Malory Towers</strong> meets something deeper and darker altogether.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a huge, sprawling world, crammed full of interesting female characters. The story focuses on the central pair of Antimony and Katriona, who are best friends, and their experiences going to school and becoming part of a magical/technological war which is threatening to move from cold to hot.</p>
<p>The comic is subtle, curious, funny and strange, with tones of <a href="http://www.serenavalentino.com/projects/gloomcookie/" target="_blank"><strong>Gloom Cookie</strong></a>, although the art is cleaner and more colourful; slightly French and manga-esque in feel. I particularly like the fact that the world has rules that are revealed as you go along, and how many things (and people) are left unexplained and without immediate resolution. Relationships are equally complicated &#8211; this is a world where love and feelings are explored in detail.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all for the moment &#8211; more in the next post. Please share any webcomics you find with the team here, as we&#8217;re always looking for more reading material. For bonus points, here&#8217;s a link from the <a href="http://www.themarysue.com" target="_blank">Mary Sue</a> on Gail Simone&#8217;s griping about <a href="http://themarysue.tumblr.com/post/58248295528/gailsimone-claysad-gail-simones-twitter" target="_blank">writing those troublesome male characters</a>. Because it made me laugh this afternoon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>When we heard that author <strong>Maura McHugh</strong>&#8216;s latest graphic novel <strong>Róisín Dubh</strong> &#8211; starring a young bicycle-riding suffragette who fights dark supernatural forces! &#8211; would soon be hitting stores at last, we were bubbling over with excitement.

To get us started, why don&#8217;t you tell us a bit about <em>Róisín Dubh </em>, which has just gone on release.</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://roisindubhcomic.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Róisín Dubh</strong></a> is a three-issue comic book series that will also be collected and bound as a graphic novel. It&#8217;s set in Ireland in 1899 and follows the adventures of Róisín Sheridan, an eighteen-year-old woman who harbours ambitions to be an actress. Her life is altered forever when she and her parents are attacked on the road by a bloodthirsty man called Abhartach who has just risen from the earth. Róisín&#8217;s parents are killed and she is left for dead&#8230; until she is given a mission by ancient powers. She has to go against the conventions of the day, and her previous notions of what is possible, to try and put Abhartach back in the ground&#8230; but the person who raised Abhartach from his 1,400-year stasis has other plans.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>What might feminist readers enjoy about the comic? As if an Irish suffragette killing demons isn&#8217;t enough to get anyone interested&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I hope there&#8217;s plenty there for everyone, but the women&#8217;s suffrage movement was on my mind from the start. Róisín has had a liberal, educated upbringing, she was allowed a lot of leeway as a child, but as a woman she&#8217;s starting to discover that there are more limits on her than she imagined.</p>
<p>For instance, that simple thing her father says to her: <a href="http://roisindubhcomic.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/rd1-1-3new1.jpg"><em>of course women should have the right to vote&#8230; but a career on the stage? It&#8217;s disreputable.</em> </a>The struggle for equal rights is a slow erosion of the <em>but</em>s. People are always full of reasons why you can have some rights, but not all.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why Róisín has a bike. People forget that the bicycle was a huge boon to women in the nineteenth century &#8211; it gave them a freedom of movement that they didn&#8217;t enjoy previously, and it also helped bring about a change in clothing.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_B._Anthony">Susan B. Anthony</a> said in 1896 that she thought the bicycle &#8216;has done more to emancipate women than anything else in the world, It gives a woman a feeling of freedom and self-reliance. The moment she takes her seat she knows she can&#8217;t get into harm unless she gets off her bicycle, and away she goes, the picture of free, untrammeled womanhood.'&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>What sort of heroine is Róisín &#8211; who is she as a character? Which other comic book heroines have inspired you in the past and what do you like about them?</strong></p>

The events in the comic book means she&#8217;s forced to deal with tragedy while learning she has far less control over her life. These are the kinds of lessons we often learn in life, although in Róisín&#8217;s case they involve an undead creature, magicians and ancient Irish divinities!</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t drawn upon any other comic book heroines consciously in relation to Róisín, but there were a number that had an impact upon me over the years. First was Judge Anderson in <strong>2000 AD</strong>. I didn&#8217;t read many American comics when I was growing up in Ireland as there weren&#8217;t many available at the time. <strong>2000 AD</strong> was the premiere title for young teens then, so I read it too. Her first appearance in the Judge Death storyline (written by John Wagner and drawn by Brian Bolland) ticked all the boxes for me: horror and a great female lead.</p>
<p>What I loved about Anderson was her humour. She was the only one who poked fun at Dredd, and I loved that the Psi-Division were given loads of leeway because of the job they did and the high risk of their brains being fried in the process. Plus, she saves the world through an extreme act of self-sacrifice (thankfully, she didn&#8217;t remain in stasis forever!).</p>
<p>A while ago I read a comment on a website by one of the early artists of Anderson, in which he said he thought that she wasn&#8217;t very complex and was created for a bit of titillation for the lads. That comment disappointed me greatly. I guess he didn&#8217;t realise that Anderson was one of the <em>very few</em> women in <strong>2000 AD</strong> at the time, and for that reason alone she had a big impact on the girls/women who read the series. Having a representation of women in comics book series is really important, and Dredd himself is not exactly the most complex character! I don&#8217;t usually hanker after writing particular characters, but writing Anderson would be a dream project.</p>
<p>Another character that had a big impact was <strong>Tank Girl</strong> (Jamie Hewlett and Alan Martin). She had a punk sensibility and a sense of humour, and liked sex, drugs and driving a tank &#8211; what was not to love?</p>
<p>Other characters I like are David Mack&#8217;s <strong>Scarab</strong>, <strong>Storm</strong> from the <strong>X-Men</strong> (woefully underused, I think), Alan Moore&#8217;s <strong>Halo Jones</strong> (another character I&#8217;d kill to write) and <strong>Promethea</strong>, Warren Ellis&#8217;s <strong>Jenny Sparks</strong>, and finally, the goddess herself, <strong>Wonder Woman</strong>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve only fallen in love with the Wonder Woman character in the past year, which is completely the result of <strong>Gail Simone</strong>&#8216;s amazing writing. I&#8217;m also now a big fan of Simone&#8217;s <strong>Secret Six</strong> and <strong>Birds of Prey</strong> &#8211; so you can include all the (many) female characters in those series on my list now. Simone is one of the best comic book writers in the industry in my opinion, and she&#8217;s particularly adept at dialogue, especially for the female characters. Her comic books consistently pass the <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2005/10/16/badrepwiki-the-bechdel-test/">Bechdel Test</a>, which so many titles still don&#8217;t do.&#8221;</p>

What have you learned from this so far, and has it ever worked against you?</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;No change occurs if you remain silent. It&#8217;s that simple &#8211; but it&#8217;s not necessarily easy to speak up.</p>
<p>As a woman you know a likely response to raising an issue &#8211; such as the lack of women at an event &#8211; is that you will be dismissed or attacked (especially on the Internet).</p>
<p>So, I always strive to be fair and logical in how I present my case. Sometimes that&#8217;s difficult because I feel so passionately about women getting a fair shake &#8211; well, everyone getting a fair shake, no matter their gender, ethnicity, sexuality, etc.</p>
<p>A number of people have asked me if I think I&#8217;m damaging my career with some of the issues I&#8217;ve raised. So far I&#8217;ve never experienced it, but would it stop me? No.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s be realistic. I&#8217;m speaking out on issues from a pretty safe environment. If I was a female union representative in Mexico &#8211; for example &#8211; I would have a genuine risk in speaking up. Or a mother trying to access education for her girls in Afghanistan. Those people inspire me &#8211; they are taking real risks with their lives and yet find the courage to stand up for what is right.</p>
<p>When I think of that it puts what I do in perspective! (And it makes me donate to aid organisations that help people in those risky situations.)&#8221;</p>
