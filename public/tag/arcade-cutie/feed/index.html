										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>In which Team BadRep discuss Halloween costumes via email in a thoroughly serious and academically high-flying manner.  </em></p>
<h3>Final Round: What are <em>you </em>wearing?</h3>
<p><strong>Miranda:</strong> Before we answer this question, I have to say I was almost tempted by this, the most surreal thing Yandy has ever spawned. I give you <a href="http://www.yandy.com/Arcade-Cutie-Costume.php ">ARCADE CUTIE</a>. So unhinged I might actually wear it. </p>

Look at the FACIAL EXPRESSION on the skirt. The skirt is actually <em>embarrassed</em> to be part of the outfit, which contains not one but THREE STRATEGICALLY PLACED FACES. It&#8217;s even better than <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/10/31/the-halloween-costume-interlude/">Boob Fury</a>. Absolutely blew me away in the sheer entropic blaze of its own wrong-glory. Katy Perry has nothing on it. But anyway, what are we all wearing? I suspect almost none of us are going down the off-the-peg costume route? </p>
<p><strong>Sarah J</strong>: I’m going to two parties so I&#8217;m attempting to combine the themes <em>The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe</em> and <em>Le Tigre</em> into one outfit. I haven’t really worked out how yet, but I think I’ll probably be Riot Lucy (who looks pretty similar to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/artists/b/bis/">Manda Rin from Bis</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Miranda:</strong> Alternate-Universe Lucy, who survives that horrible train crash in <strong>The Last Battle</strong>! Maybe you&#8217;re undead, too, and vowing revenge on CS Lewis for such a terrible plotting decision. </p>
<p><strong>Jenni:</strong> I was actually the<em> wardrobe</em> from <strong>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe </strong>one year at school. </p>

Needless to say, I did not use a shop-bought costume. Pirates do particularly badly in terms of costume-shop gender separation &#8211; all the women&#8217;s clothes are labelled &#8220;VIXEN PIRATE&#8221;, &#8220;WENCH PIRATE&#8221;, &#8220;MAIDEN PIRATE&#8221;, and so on, while the dudes get to be &#8220;CUT THROAT JACK&#8221;. So I just bought some plastic pistols and raided Age Concern. There was slightly more boob-coverage going on than in this 1700s etching. This year I think I&#8217;m going more trad-gothic-novel-heroine, but hopefully with an impressive amount of lace and waft. </p>
<p><strong>Rhian:</strong> My Halloween costumes tend to be ridiculous rather than sexy &#8211; in the past five years I&#8217;ve dressed as Terry Hall (incredibly vague tangential &#8216;Ghost Town&#8217; joke), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Bateman">Patrick Bateman</a> once, and Thatcher twice. Last year I had an entire party themed around Tory/Coalition Horror, but I fully accept that&#8217;s just me being slightly self-parodic. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever knowingly done Sexy!Halloween, it feels like a bit of a cop-out almost in the dressing-up stakes (as in, I&#8217;d far rather someone react to me with &#8216;That&#8217;s really funny&#8217; than &#8216;Wow, you look hot&#8217;). </p>
<p><strong>Jenni:</strong> Your predilection for dressing as Thatcher has <em>always</em> worried me, Rhian.</p>
<p><strong>Markgraf:</strong> As I warned at the start of this chat, I&#8217;m going as a sexed-up <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Misdreavus_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">Misdreavus</a>. That&#8217;s a Pokemon. <a href="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6144/6041520314_0c6f7ae54b_o.jpg">And I&#8217;m not even sorry</a>. I love the shit out of Hallowe’en, and dressing up, and monsters, and bodypaint, and Pokemon, and horrible outfits that try to be sexy but aren’t.  I love the former five for obvious reasons, but I love the latter because they’re so incongruous. I mean, sexy <em>takeaway food?</em> What the fuck? The allure of dressing as a tarted-up cartoon ghost from a videogame with the assistance of stripper heels and bodypaint is always going to be too much for me to resist. <em>Also,</em> I’m a boy.  Hyper-femme incongruous drag is something I can pull off.  So why not?  Halloween is for dressing up as things that’ll impress or terrify, and I can’t think of anything more impressive and terrifying than sexy Pokemon cosplay in little more than paint and a wig.</p>
<p><strong>Miranda:</strong> Thatcher, a sexed-up Pokemon, and Riot Grrrl CS Lewis. We know how to party in here.  How do I compete? Maybe I&#8217;ll just build some kind of furry several-headed contraption that fits over my shoulders and just go as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Wolf_Moon">Three Wolf Moon</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Jenni:</strong> Or <a href="http://www.themarysue.com/pixar-luxo-costume/">the Pixar lamp.</a> </p>
<p><strong>Miranda:</strong> That person wins the entire internet. </p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong>: Well, I <em>was</em> going to dress as a pumpkinhead &#8211; as in, I am going to hollow out a pumpkin and wear it on my head &#8211; but this whole exchange is making me think maybe <em>I</em> should sex it up a bit. Me, with a pumpkin on my head&#8230; and a bikini. </p>
<p><em>Happy Halloween from Team BadRep!</em></p>
