					<description><![CDATA[The more children's books I read and the more princesses I come to know, the more I realise that 'kickass' probably wasn't the best term to use.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>When I think about everything about womanhood that hamstrung me with fear when I was thirteen it all came down, really, to princesses. I didn’t think I had to work hard to be a woman (which is scary but obviously eventually achievable). I thought I had to somehow magically &#8211; through superhuman psychic effort &#8211; transform into a princess instead. That’s how I’d get fallen in love with. That’s how I’d get along. That’s how the world would welcome me.</p>
<p>&#8211; Caitlin Moran, <strong>How to be a Woman</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Welcome to part two of Kickass Princesses – a look at some subversive female protagonists in children&#8217;s literature. <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/03/28/kickass-princesses-part-1/">You can read Part 1 here.</a></p>
<p>The more children&#8217;s books I read and the more princesses I come to know, the more I realise that &#8216;kickass&#8217; probably wasn&#8217;t the best term to use. Some of these characters do kick ass, but the main feature is turning out to be simply that they make unconventional princesses.</p>
<p>As the archetype of a fairytale princess is so ingrained, it takes looking at a wide variety of &#8216;unprincessy&#8217; examples to unpick exactly what some of our starting assumptions are. A closer look at the &#8216;unconventional&#8217; princesses here, and in my previous post, reveals that these women and girls have agency, interests, and are more than just a beautiful, delicate, unsullied physical appearance. Sometimes they aren&#8217;t even beautiful at all. What they are – what, we realise, makes them &#8216;unprincessy&#8217; – is often simply the fact that they are two-dimensional characters.</p>
<p>Ouch. This stereotype needs subverting roughly forever ago. On with the show&#8230;</p>
<h3>The Ordinary Princess</h3>

<ul>
<li><em>Written and illustrated by MM Kaye, published in 1980 by Doubleday</em></li>
</ul>
<p>At 107 pages, this one&#8217;s aimed at a slightly older age group than the rest of the books in this post, which are all picture books.</p>
<p>The plot begins when the seventh princess is born in the land of Phantasmorania, and even the fairies are invited to the Christening, despite the King&#8217;s reservations. The bad-tempered and seaweedy fairy Crustacea, pissed off by the bad journey in to the palace, gives the baby the gift of ordinariness. Instantly the baby cries for the first time, and becomes considerably less attractive. As she grows up, our girl Amethyst (known as Amy) doesn&#8217;t look great in fine gowns like her blonde, willowy, ethereal and frankly boring and unknowable sisters. Instead, she loves climbing down the wisteria which grows up the castle walls and sneaking out to the forest.</p>
<p>Thanks to her extremely ordinary looks, Amy turns out to be impossible to marry off. Oh, the shame of it all! Not that our girl is bothered, but the rest of the kingdom is. When she learns of a harebrained scheme to get her rescued from a dragon so a prince will be obliged to marry her, she runs away to the forest, where she lives happily until her clothes start falling apart. So, in need of money to buy a new dress, she goes and gets a job in another palace, living in disguise as an ordinary girl. Where she meets a prince – but I&#8217;ll leave some plot to those who want to read it.</p>
<p>The style of writing makes for a truly luscious fairytale, and the black and white line-drawn illustrations by the author are very pretty too (just the right side of twee). Plot-wise, this book is strongest in its treatment of Amy&#8217;s interaction with Crustacea, her Godmother, who is practical, warm-yet-tough, and advises her to get on with it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s weakest – in my humble socialist opinion – when our girl loves every minute of working insane hours on the lowest rungs of the servant-ladder. C&#8217;mon, girlie, you&#8217;ve worked out it&#8217;ll take you roughly a year to earn enough to buy a new dress. Aren&#8217;t you a bit annoyed at the sucky pay? Also: the insinuation throughout the book that freckles and an upturned nose make someone undateable got on my nerves quite a bit. Freckles can be well hot, and don&#8217;t get me started on pixie faces&#8230;</p>
<p>(Interestingly, each book I&#8217;ve looked at for these posts has often pushed an idea of what a typical beautiful princess looks like, but none of them quite match.)</p>
<p>I was a little disappointed in how conventionally the ends got tied up, but I suppose how the plot came to be is more important than what came to be. Our girl has agency, there&#8217;s no doubt about it. And there&#8217;s nothing wrong with a happy ending.</p>
<h3>Princess Pigsty</h3>

Image shared under Fair Use guidelines, (c) Chickenhouse books." width="227" height="185" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><em>By Cornelia Funke and Kerstin Meyer, Chickenhouse, 1997</em></li>
</ul>
<p>In <strong>Princess Pigsty</strong> our girl is one of three sisters, who live the traditional fairytale princess life:</p>
<blockquote><p>Their beautiful clothes filled thirty wardrobes. They had footmen to blow their noses for them and ladies-in-waiting to tidy up their rooms, hang up their clothes and polish their crowns until they shone.</p>
<p>Every morning, three teachers taught them royal behaviour – how to sit on a throne without fidgeting, how to curtsey without falling over, how to yawn with your mouth closed and how to smile for a whole hour without taking a break.</p></blockquote>
<p>Isabella, the youngest, despite being perfectly capable of walking the princessy walk, is not happy, and makes her feelings known by waking up the whole castle shouting:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I am tired of being a princess! It&#8217;s boring, boring, boring!”<br />
Her older sisters looked up from their feather pillows in surprise.</p>
<p>“I want to get dirty!” cried Isabella, bouncing around on the bed. “I want to blow my own nose. I don&#8217;t want to smile all the time. I want to make my own sandwiches. I don&#8217;t want to have my hair curled ever again. I do not want to be a princess any more!”</p>
<p>And with that she took her crown and threw it out of the window. Splash! It landed in the goldfish pond.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the pitched battle of wills with the King that follows, Isabella is sent to work in the kitchens until she changes her mind. When she enjoys her work in the kitchens, learning about how their food is made and essentially having too much fun to relent, she&#8217;s sent to the pigsty – where she gets along with the pigs and enjoys their company even more.</p>
<p>Eventually, seeing there is no way around it, her father relents and says she doesn&#8217;t have to be all princessy if she doesn&#8217;t want to – but by now our girl likes the pigs and stays in the pigsty just as often as in her feather bed.</p>
<p>Though no mention is made of any innate unprincessy looks (beyond curled hair), Isabella rejects her princessy role in life quite actively. While Amy of <strong>The Ordinary Princess</strong> is a failure at traditional princessy things (but isn&#8217;t that bothered about it, either) Isabella has lots of guts and lots of agency, not to mention an upbeat and cheerful nature. Eventually her father is won round. The patriarch isn&#8217;t a baddie, and – once it&#8217;s clear she&#8217;s happier that way – he accepts her as she is. Tangled, mucky and doing things that interest her. Hip-hip hooray for doing what you want! Hip-hip hooray for converting people! Hip-hip hooray for male allies!</p>
<h3>Shrek!</h3>

<ul>
<li><em>William Steig, Macmillan, 1990</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Didn&#8217;t know <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrek"><strong>Shrek</strong></a> started out as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrek!">a book</a>? It did, and it was&#8230; not a huge amount like the movie franchise. (Have the first part read to you by Stanley Tucci <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmUC7nsrzlg">here</a>, though sadly without pictures.) Shrek, in both media, is a famously revolting and ugly character, who delights in his own disgustingness (“wherever Shrek went, every living creature fled. How it tickled him to be so repulsive”) &#8211; but that&#8217;s where most of the similarities end.</p>
<p>The book is a very short picture book with a quest narrative. A witch tells Shrek&#8217;s fortune: “Then you wed a princess who/Is even uglier than you.” Shrek decides this sounds great, and goes off in search of this princess.</p>
<blockquote><p>He strode in and his fat lips fell open. There before him was the most stunningly ugly princess on the surface of the planet.</p></blockquote>
<p>When they meet they declare their love for each other&#8217;s revoltingness, and live “horribly ever after.” But if you&#8217;ve seen any of the movies, you&#8217;ll know this wasn&#8217;t quite how it went down when Dreamworks got their hands on it.</p>
<p>In the movie Princess Fiona (who has a name, unlike in the book) is only ugly after dark, &#8211; during the day she appears as a beautiful woman, and during the night she is an ogre, and she&#8217;s self-conscious about it. The only way to cure this is with “true love&#8217;s kiss” – and it&#8217;s initially an unpleasant surprise for her to learn that when the spell is broken she&#8217;s actually stuck with ogre mode constantly.</p>
<p>While the movie does feature a green monster called Shrek and an (eventually) &#8216;ugly&#8217; princess – their unconventionality is treated as something they&#8217;re both self-conscious about. Fiona, especially, with all the princessy expectations heaped upon her, needs reassurance that she&#8217;s loveable.</p>
<p>Alhough the movie doesn&#8217;t mention weight specifically, one of the main factors of Fiona&#8217;s transformation (apart from the green skin) is that she becomes considerably heavier. Fiona is more of an everywoman – learning that she doesn&#8217;t need to be a size 8 to find love – and literally kicking ass. Caitlin Moran tracks the rewrite as part of a post-feminist trend:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the last decade the post-feminist reaction to princesses has been the creation of alternative princesses: the spunky chicks in <strong>Shrek</strong> and the newer Disney films who wear trousers, do kung fu and save the prince.</p></blockquote>
<p>While some cool people (I&#8217;m looking at you, <a href="http://www.babette-cole.com/">Babette Cole</a>) have been subverting these roles for a long time, it takes a while before the effect trickles down to a Hollywood blockbuster and the much wider audience that a movie like <strong>Shrek</strong> can reach.</p>
<p>While the original very short picture book is more about two people with unconventional values and no qualms or neuroses about them – a la <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twits"><strong>The Twits</strong></a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addams_family"><strong>The Addams Family</strong></a> – the movie <strong>Shrek</strong> presents Fiona as someone extremely kickass, but with a fairly conventional narrative of body issues (though admittedly hers are mythical ones) and a postmodern self-consciousness about breaking the known conventions of the &#8216;fairytale&#8217; wedding.</p>
<p>In this way Fiona is far more relatable (and has infintely more agency) than the nameless princess in the book, but part of me is sad that she doesn&#8217;t start with the self-assurance of our happily ugly picturebook princess. After all – if this is a world where gingerbread men can talk and cats can fence – surely we can have a princess who can just get on with her thang <em>without</em> worrying about being pretty enough?</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Here's why I think Caitlin Moran's book should be compulsory reading for boys.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re a diverse bunch here at BadRep towers, and sometimes we don&#8217;t agree. When that happens, we sometimes offer a second opinion from another of the team. Sarah C <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/07/04/bookworm-caitlin-moran-how-to-be-a-woman/">reviewed Caitlin Moran&#8217;s book for us last month</a> &#8211; with one or two exceptions, she thought it was brilliant. For contrast, here is my review:</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s BRILLIANT.</p>
<p>Sarah C lent me <strong>How To Be A Woman</strong>, Caitlin Moran&#8217;s recent feminism handbook/memoir, and I expected to like it. I follow Moran <a href="http://twitter.com/caitlinmoran">on twitter</a> where she&#8217;s always deeply funny, and I thought this would be an enjoyable read even if it&#8217;s just her personal take on the issues. What surprised me is how incredibly effective the book is &#8211; and how it does some things which are amazing from a male point of view.</p>
<p>Of course, cis male points of view aren&#8217;t automatically important in feminism (with some arguing that they have no place in it at all). When it comes to deciding what women want their future to be, and what they feel is harmful or unacceptable to that, men don&#8217;t really need to be part of the process. And most male feminists that I know understand that.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to <em>implementing</em> feminism against the status quo of patriarchal bullshit, when women are fighting for their rights from one direction it helps if men are on board too. If men feel threatened by coming changes, they&#8217;re more likely to do the kind of heinous, disgusting, and frequently violent things that we see thrown back at women who challenge anything the patriarchy is currently comfortable with.</p>
<p>Which is why I think that Caitlin Moran&#8217;s book should be compulsory reading for <em>boys</em>.</p>

<p>Moran does two things which are absolutely crucial. She actively calls bullshit on the many forms of misogyny which have somehow become acceptable in society, and then she <em>laughs</em> at them.</p>
<p>Calling bullshit is not a small thing. It takes incredible strength to say &#8220;no&#8221; to Hollywood, magazines, posters, tv and the expectations of your friends, family, colleagues and boss. By being brutally honest about becoming a woman &#8211; periods, body hair, boobs, everything about a teenager&#8217;s brain &#8211; she humanises it and makes it possible to go against expectations. Of COURSE the idea that every single woman needs a Brazilian shave by default is stupid bullshit. Step back a moment and compare it to real life as she does, and it becomes easy to laugh&#8230; and more importantly to finish laughing and shout HELL NO.</p>
<p><em>Boys will read this.</em> They want to know what girls think, and what the changes happening to girls&#8217; bodies and minds are actually like. The book is full of comedy but also danger, which keeps it exciting and holds your attention. I&#8217;m always going on about how pop culture is great because it engages people and slips messages past them while they&#8217;re having fun &#8211; this does exactly that, really well.</p>
<p>Importantly, when talking to the male side of the equation, it also demystifies. Male readers can look at the stupidity of some conventions, see what the reality is for women and it will become easier for them to realise where the bullshit lies.</p>
<p>Moran speaks directly to men in the book as well as women. After telling female readers to say the words &#8220;I am a feminist&#8221; out loud, possibly while standing on a chair (&#8220;<em>Say it. SAY IT. SAY IT NOW! Because if you can&#8217;t, you&#8217;re basically bending over saying &#8216;Kick my arse and take my vote, please, the patriarchy.&#8217;</em>&#8220;) she adds this:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;And do not think you shouldn&#8217;t be standing on that chair, shouting &#8216;I AM A FEMINIST!&#8217; if you are a boy. A male feminist is one of the most glorious end-products of evolution. A male feminist should ABSOLUTELY be on the chair &#8211; so we ladies may all toast you, in champagne, before coveting your body wildly.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Note to men: this is relatively true. Identifying as a feminist in actions as well as words (unless you&#8217;re a lying weasel who is just doing it to get into their knickers) will by itself put you quite far into the &#8220;not a raging asshole&#8221; category. That&#8217;s hot. I&#8217;m just saying.</p>
<p>I agree with Sarah on the minor disappointments. The author&#8217;s use of &#8220;retard&#8221; on page 5 really jars and stands out, just plain doesn&#8217;t work, and isn&#8217;t okay. Where Sarah found it limiting that the events are focused only on Moran&#8217;s personal experiences, though, I didn&#8217;t think this mattered as much to the message. Where Caitlin says she doesn&#8217;t feel that the word &#8220;boobs&#8221; really describes any part of her body (and &#8220;breasts&#8221; is worse), I know some women who feel comfortable with that word &#8211; but her final decision doesn&#8217;t seem as crucial as long as the reader is made aware that girls face the situation of having to find the right words for themselves. Making everyone ask themselves the question means the answer <em>she</em> chooses almost doesn&#8217;t matter.</p>
<p>There are plenty of universal truths in there. The chapter where she reveals how the word &#8220;fat&#8221; has basically become weaponised to a greater degree than previous nuclear-level playground insults, and gives examples, all rings totally true. The stories of her 16-year-old self veer between amusing and devastating, but it just helps the reader identify with the general problem. Hell, it made *me* identify with it, when my 16-year-old self was dangerously underweight, gangly, six-foot and male.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s the secret. The reason I&#8217;m excited about this book is that it&#8217;s the first one I think will be hugely <em>effective</em>, to women but especially to the average man. There are many modes of communication which just don&#8217;t work: language is important, but I think we can frequently become so removed from daily discourse in our attempts to avoid discriminatory words that we lose the audience entirely. Caitlin Moran will change male attitudes a million times more powerfully than, say, a paper by feminist academics which would only be read by feminist academics, containing newly invented language that boys barely understand and have not been convinced they need.</p>
<blockquote><p>You can tell whether some misogynistic societal pressure is being exerted on women by calmly enquiring, &#8220;And are the *men* doing this, as well?&#8221; If they aren&#8217;t, chances are you&#8217;re dealing with what we strident feminists refer to as &#8220;some total fucking bullshit&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>How to be a woman</strong> engages the reader with great humour and truth, says things of interest, and is entertaining enough to do the pop-culture stealth-feminism thing. The early reaction from feminists was &#8220;This is an important book!&#8221;, but the opinions then swayed back and forth a bit afterwards. I think &#8220;important&#8221; is precisely the right word, because it&#8217;s going to <em>work</em>.</p>
<p>Teenage boys! Want to know about teenage girls? Read this book. Men! Want to read something that&#8217;s genuinely hilarious and interesting, even if you don&#8217;t &#8216;do&#8217; feminism? <em>Read this book.</em> It&#8217;s angry without being exclusionary, very funny, very honest, and has a real shot at inspiring a new generation to become feminists.</p>
<p>Top marks, Moran.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let&#8217;s be clear here, I love<strong> Caitlin Moran</strong>. Her <a href="http://twitter.com/caitlinmoran">tweets</a> make me laugh until milk comes out of my nose, often at times when I have not drunk milk. That is how magic she is. So once I found out she had written a book on feminism I almost broke land speed records on the way to the bookshop. <a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Caitlin-Moran-Book.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="6321" data-permalink="/2011/07/04/bookworm-caitlin-moran-how-to-be-a-woman/caitlin-moran-book/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Caitlin-Moran-Book.jpg?fit=312%2C500&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="312,500" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Caitlin Moran Book How to be a Woman Cover" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Caitlin-Moran-Book.jpg?fit=187%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Caitlin-Moran-Book.jpg?fit=312%2C500&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6321" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Caitlin-Moran-Book-187x300.jpg?resize=187%2C300" alt="Caitlin Moran How to be a Woman book cover showing a colour portrait of the author, a woman in her thirties with dark hair with a blonde streak in it" width="187" height="300" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Caitlin-Moran-Book.jpg?w=187&amp;ssl=1 187w, https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Caitlin-Moran-Book.jpg?w=312&amp;ssl=1 312w" sizes="(max-width: 187px) 100vw, 187px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Which is high praise as these days, as I usually balk at the price of books when they can be gotten for free from your local library &#8211; and indeed should be for the most part, because otherwise those fools in power will try to close them.</p>
<p>Torygeddon aside, I&#8217;ve recently been really happy with the &#8220;new&#8221; (over the past ten or so years; they aren&#8217;t appearing like the rash of teenage vampire novels) books about feminism &#8211; like <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/jan/31/living-dolls-natasha-walter"><strong>Living Dolls</strong> by Natasha Walter</a>. Angry books, clever books, often books by young women. But at the same time I did get a little turned off by them &#8211; they were also difficult books, thoughful, smart books that needed full your full attention and dealt with very big, very important feminist issues in very serious ways. After which you tend to feel sad, or angry and a bit frustrated.</p>
<p>Whilst there is certainly room and need for those books, there&#8217;s also a need for this book. Because this isn&#8217;t about the big stuff, not entirely. It&#8217;s about one woman and her journey through a very personal feminism. It&#8217;s about pants being annoyingly too small, fashion, eating too much cheese, having a crap dog, rowing with your family and the general business of living.  It&#8217;s pop-feminism, and we at BadRep are all behind that &#8211; the kind of feminism that is easy to access, relevant and doesn&#8217;t require you to have digested a thesaurus or the entire works of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helene_Cixous">Helene Cixous</a> in the original french. It&#8217;s a &#8220;normal&#8221; book, and normalising feminism is something I am all for. It does cover some &#8220;serious feminist&#8221; topics &#8211; such as abortion (covered in more detail in a review by <a href="http://www.abortionrights.org.uk/index.php/media-and-resource-centre/news/257">Abortion Rights over here</a>), having children, not having children, prostitution, rape, sexism in all its many forms. But you never feel preached at, or patronised.</p>
<p>So, what&#8217;s it like to read? Well, it&#8217;s a bit like being in the pub with our Editor, Miranda, when she&#8217;s had a couple of ciders and is &#8220;holding forth&#8221;. Certainly as far as goes the excessive use of CAPS LOCK AND EXCLAMATION POINTS TO MAKE THINGS STAND OUT!!!<sup><a href="/2011/07/04/bookworm-caitlin-moran-how-to-be-a-woman/#footnote_0_6320" id="identifier_0_6320" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" &ldquo;Oh GOD, guilty as charged&rdquo; &ndash; Ed ">1</a></sup> To call it &#8220;friendly and personal&#8221; sounds a bit pat and cliched, but it is. The book takes the form of an autobiography of growing up &#8211; poor and in Wolverhampton &#8211; and dealing with the challenges of becoming a woman. It&#8217;s deeply refreshing to find some non-university educated, working class feminism. Feminism that doesn&#8217;t rely heavily on theory. Feminism that makes me laugh, and read sections out to my flatmate so we can both spew milk from our noses. It&#8217;s a book that&#8217;s easy and fun (yes, feminism can be fun!) to read, and I devoured it in a few hours.</p>
<p>I recommend it, naturally. But I also offer a few caveats. There were a couple of points that I didn&#8217;t like, and they came from the same place as the stuff I did like. You see, when you write informally, personally and from the heart, you also tend to be a bit less careful than you might with word use. And sloppy language is very perilous when you are criticising sexism, which is also about sloppy language, in part. The word &#8220;retarded&#8221; for example, is used a couple of times, to describe being like someone with a learning disability. This is not cool. It&#8217;s a word that we should all stop using (much like &#8220;n*gger&#8221;). There is no reclaiming this word. End of.</p>
<p>I also found myself getting a bit twitchy with some of her assumptions &#8211; and again, these were down to the personal, anecdotal approach. Her feminism is not exactly my feminism. I do not believe, for example, that women are quite so biologically constrained that cystitis is the reason we didn&#8217;t found empires. I found the focus in on the experience of living in a cisgender woman&#8217;s body and the assumption of  &#8220;natural&#8221; consequences to this a bit disarming. But then, my teenage years were not hers. My growing pains were different.</p>
<p>It is a brave book. It doesn&#8217;t pull any punches, and there will be bits that you disagree with. But that&#8217;s part of the point of polemics; they stand their ground, pitbull-like, and assert a view. The ensuing debate carries them forward. And the jokes. Still cleaning milk off my t-shirt over the high-heeled shoe bit.</p>
