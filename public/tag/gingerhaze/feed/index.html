					<description><![CDATA[It is a thing of beauty. Let me show you what I mean. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hawkeye, introduced to many by the <strong>Avengers</strong> film but a Marvel character since his first appearance in <strong>Tales of Suspense</strong> all the way back in 1964, has struck a bit of a chord on Tumblr &#8211; particularly in his incarnation as Jeremy Renner in <strong>Avengers Assemble</strong>. <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/07/09/guest-post-in-defence-of-fanfiction/" target="_blank">Shipped</a> mercilessly with the Hulk in <a href="http://tumblr.com/tagged/hulkeye">the Hulkeye fandom</a> &#8211; and <a href="http://gingerhaze.tumblr.com/post/23086933818/hulk-like-to-look-at-the-pictures">particularly adorably by Noelle ‘gingerhaze’ Stevenson</a> &#8211; not a day goes by without Hawkeye in some incarnation crossing my dash.</p>
<p>Lately, though, something has been stirring in the Tumblsphere (which is definitely a word shut up SHUT UP). Comic portrayals of female characters have been questioned, dissected, and found to be both objectification-tastic, and downright anatomically impossible.</p>
<p>Now, if there’s anything that Tumblr loves, it’s mixing up social justice with fandom.</p>
<p>Thus, <a href="http://www.thehawkeyeinitiative.com"><strong>The Hawkeye Initiative</strong></a> was born. The rules are simple: find a female character in comics being portrayed as an object and/or in a position that human anatomy would simply laugh at, then redraw Hawkeye in that pose, wearing the same outfit.</p>
<p>It is a <em>thing of beauty</em>. Let me show you what I mean. Click a thumbnail to open each image without leaving this page.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> [<a href="/2012/12/10/the-hawkeye-initiative/">See image gallery at badreputation.org.uk</a>] </p>
<p>If you’re a Tumblr user, <a href="http://www.thehawkeyeinitiative.com">The Hawkeye Initiative</a> is a Tumblr despite its domain, and can be followed like any other. If you have a sense of humour and an understanding workplace, I think it’s unlikely that you’ll regret doing so.</p>

<h2> Comics: Gingerhaze</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re on tumblr and involved in fandom at all, you might have seen her art around, but if not, <a href="http://gingerhaze.tumblr.com/aboutme">Gingerhaze</a> (aka Noelle Stevenson) is a talented young artist based in Maryland, working on her illustration degree and spending her spare time drawing some pretty neat comics on her Wacom tablet.</p>
<p>Covering franchises such as the<a href="http://gingerhaze.tumblr.com/post/11335514665/wait-were-supposed-to-be-fighting-loki-i"><strong> Avengers</strong></a>, <strong>X-Men</strong>, <strong>Sherlock</strong>, <strong>Lord of the Rings</strong>, <strong>Supernatural </strong>and<a href="http://gingerhaze.tumblr.com/tagged/Katniss"><strong> The Hunger Games</strong></a>, Noelle&#8217;s simply drawn yet instantly recognisable characters, together with her sense of humour, have won her a lot of fans. She says: &#8220;I mercilessly make fun of everything I love. It’s my particular way of disguising the sheer magnitude of the feelings that I have.&#8221; And the running jokes in her art &#8211; the hipster hobbits of <a href="http://gingerhaze.tumblr.com/tagged/The_Broship">the broship of the ring</a>, Marvel Comics&#8217; Loki characterised as Thor&#8217;s <a href="http://gingerhaze.tumblr.com/post/9978999971/loki-i-told-you-not-to-bug-me-when-im-hanging">annoying</a> <a href="http://gingerhaze.tumblr.com/post/9237966525/lokis-about-to-get-so-many-wedgies">little</a> <a href="http://gingerhaze.tumblr.com/post/7441763875/then-maybe-ill-pin-him-down-under-mjolnir-and-eat">brother</a> &#8211; could be what keep people coming back.</p>
<p>Here at BadRep Towers, we love her take on the <strong>Scooby Doo</strong> characters Daphne and Velma: <a href="http://gingerhaze.tumblr.com/tagged/velma">&#8220;You hurt my nerd, you&#8217;re going down!&#8221;</a> There should be a word for bromance between two women, because that is CLEARLY what tattooed, chain-smoking Daphne and hipster glasses-wearing Velma have going on. A ladybromance? We also love how Noelle highlights the marginalisation of Mystique, or at least the limitations of the way the character was written, in the <strong>X-Men: First Class</strong> movie and fandom in her ongoing GO AWAY MYSTIQUE series (<a href="http://gingerhaze.tumblr.com/post/6310306293/i-was-supposed-to-be-writing-a-scholarship-essay">Jesus, Mystique</a>, <a href="http://gingerhaze.tumblr.com/post/6342086876/were-having-a-moment-here-mystique-why-are-you">stop ruining everything, seriously</a>).</p>
<h2>Novel: Gaie Sebold&#8217;s Babylon Steel</h2>
<p>You may or may not know (depending on whether you&#8217;ve ever read the <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/about/">Team BadRep bios</a>) that I&#8217;m an editor at a science fiction and fantasy publishing imprint. I left Solaris in October to go to another SFF publisher,  so I hope you&#8217;ll take that as proof I have no commercial motive when I recommend a badass little fantasy that Solaris publish &#8211; <strong>Babylon Steel</strong> by Gaie Sebold. It&#8217;s coming out in January 2012. <a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/babylon_steel_250x384.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/babylon_steel_250x384-195x300.jpg?resize=120%2C186" alt="cover art for Babylon Steel showing a caucasian woman with dark hair and tanned skin in armour" width="120" height="186" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<blockquote><p>Babylon Steel, ex-sword-for-hire, ex… other things, runs the best brothel in Scalentine; city of many portals, two moons, and a wide variety of races, were-creatures, and religions, not to mention the occasional insane warlock. She’s not having a good week.  The Vessels of Purity are protesting against brothels, women in the trade are being attacked, it’s tax time, and there’s not enough money to pay the bill.  So when the mysterious Darask Fain offers her a job finding a missing girl, Babylon decides to take it&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Babylon Steel</strong> is not for the kind of feminist who thinks all sex workers are evil or need to be saved from themselves, but I really hope we don&#8217;t have any of those here &#8211; it&#8217;s more for the kind of fantasy fan who&#8217;s read Terry Pratchett&#8217;s <strong>Discworld</strong> books and wishes he&#8217;d write one about the, er, <a href="http://wiki.lspace.org/wiki/Seamstresses%27_Guild">Seamstress&#8217;s Guild</a> (hem hem!). It acknowledges the bad and the good side of the job, featuring a wicked sense of humour, S&amp;M in the basement, a big green troll cooking breakfast in the kitchen, and a great epic fantasy story with a fun cast of characters, too. </p>
<h2>The Hunger Games Trailer</h2>
<p>The trailer finally came out! And it looks just as good as we hoped&#8230;</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/OgssLmsOa2s" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>A YA dystopian story with a kickass female protagonist, a great cast of characters and set in a gritty, well-realised post apocalyptic world? Sign us up!</p>

<li>&#8220;I am beginning to get the serious arse on at this trope&#8221;: <a href="http://davesaysthings.com/2011/07/alphas-cliches-and-glue/">Dave is cross about new superhero show <strong>Alphas</strong></a>.</li>
<li>USA Today would like us all to know that vampires are over, and <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2011-05-12-mermaids-make-splash_n.htm">&#8220;mermaids are the next big thing&#8221;</a>. Stephenie Meyer&#8217;s gotten involved. This can only end well, right?</li>
