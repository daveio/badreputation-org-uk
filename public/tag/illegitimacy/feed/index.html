										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<h6 style="text-align: center;">I</h6>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">INFANT</h2>
<blockquote><p>So runs my dream: but what am I?</p>
<p>An infant crying in the night:</p>
<p>An infant crying for the light:</p>
<p>And with no language but a cry.</p>
<p>Alfred Tennyson, <strong>In Memoriam A.H.H. </strong>(1849)</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>LinkedIn.</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever noticed how many I-words have the in/im prefix? These clarify what something is not.</p>
<p>Thus, <em>in-nocent</em>,<em> in-nocuous</em> = not harmful (the same root as &#8216;noxious&#8217;), <em>im-potent</em> = not powerful, <em>in-capable </em>= self explanatory; &amp;c.</p>
<p><em>Infant</em> is one such, but cleverly concealed by an unexpected etymology. Along with its archaic variants (<em>enfaunt, infaunt</em>), it derives from the Latin <em>infans</em>,<em> </em>which is the Greek &#8216;phemi&#8217; in its plundered Roman form, &#8216;femi&#8217;, plus the Latinate negative (<em>in- =</em> &#8216;without&#8217;).</p>
<p>And <em>p</em><em>hemi / femi</em>? &#8216;To make known one&#8217;s thoughts, to declare&#8217; or, simply, &#8216;to speak&#8217;.</p>
<h3>Don&#8217;t Speak.</h3>
<p>So an <em>infant </em>is &#8216;without speech&#8217;; or, as its first definition clarifies, &#8216;a child during the earliest period of its life (or still unborn)&#8217; – Shakepeare&#8217;s &#8216;Infant, Mewling and puking in the Nurses Armes&#8217;.</p>

<p>Newborns / kittens must indeed rely on &#8216;mewling&#8217; for their day-to-day needs, but paradoxically such speechlessness gives them a symbolic potency that rings in the ear.</p>
<p>Indeed, they (babies, not kittens) have &#8216;spoken&#8217; throughout history, from whistleblowing on promiscuous parents to confirmation of marital fidelity.</p>
<p>But hold on just one gosh-darned minute: that&#8217;s <em>female </em>fidelity, of course. The maternal connection is the only one you can prove, sans DNA testing. Male extra-curricular activity is neither here nor there.</p>
<p>And history is full of those awkward occasions when &#8216;speaking likenesses&#8217; gives rise to speculation about <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2273498.stm">what the child&#8217;s mother was up to nine months previously.</a></p>
<h3>Mother&#8217;s Ruin.</h3>
<p>Strangely, the infant&#8217;s own inevitable silence simply compounds the seeming power of what &#8216;they&#8217; are saying: you&#8217;re hearing with your eyes rather than your ears. Or just reading.</p>
<p>Indeed, Paulina, the faithful lady-in-waiting in <em>The Winter&#8217;s Tale</em> would prove her mistress&#8217; daughter legitimate by pointing to her book-like qualities: &#8216;Behold, my lords, / Although the print be little, the whole matter / And <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxlEH9HUt1Q">copy of the father</a>&#8230;&#8217;</p>
<p>Well into the seventeenth century, the village gossip could also deduce parental naughtiness through something as seemingly random as a child&#8217;s constitution: weakness or disease suggested either that the parents had been having too much sex to copulate at their full vigour, or else that conception had happened during menstruation. You slags.</p>
<p>And it didn&#8217;t stop there: <em>infants </em>could also tell tales through the very time of their arrival. It was commonly believed that young&#8217;uns entered the world nine months to the day after their conception. Consequently, no child born on a Sunday could be christened until its parents had made a public apology for their desecration of the Lord&#8217;s Day. Busted.</p>
<p>Even a child&#8217;s existence could be disastrously significant.</p>
<h3>To sea, To sea&#8230;</h3>
<p>In 1741, the retired sea-captain Sir Thomas Coram set up London&#8217;s first <a href="http://www.foundlingmuseum.org.uk/"><span style="color: #000000;">Foundling Hospital</span></a>, whence came unfortunates from all walks of life to ensure that their screamingly ill-begotten infants would be cared for and kept from incriminating them (not necessarily in that order).</p>
<p>In many instances, such abandonment was the alternative to killing the child or leaving it to die. So Coram was hardly acting on a whim: the social repercussions of Sin were severe, poverty and gin dependency rife (a woman&#8217;s problem, and also a means of inducing abortions – why else &#8216;Mother&#8217;s Ruin&#8217;?) and the streets covered with child corpses.</p>
<div id="attachment_1405" style="width: 276px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/the-angel.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1405" data-attachment-id="1405" data-permalink="/2010/11/29/an-alphabet-of-femininism-9-i-is-for-infant/the-angel/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/the-angel.jpg?fit=443%2C599&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="443,599" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="The Angel in the House" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/the-angel.jpg?fit=221%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/the-angel.jpg?fit=443%2C599&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1405 " src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/the-angel.jpg?resize=266%2C359" alt="Julia Margaret Cameron - The Angel in the House" width="266" height="359" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1405" class="wp-caption-text">Infantine... &#39;The Angel In The House&#39;, photographed by Julia Margaret Cameron</p></div>
<p>So Coram&#8217;s critics accused him of fostering sin, by giving it a Hospital wherein to hide: to offer succour to bastard <em>infants </em>was to shield the sinful and encourage further debauchery. Let the wages of sin speak loud and clear.</p>
<h3>Speak Now, Or Forever Hold Thy Peace.</h3>
<p>In its second meaning, <em>infant</em> becomes more defined: it does not simply signify a speechless-screaming babe-in-arms, but also &#8216;a person under legal age; a minor&#8217; (someone who has not &#8216;completed their twenty-first year&#8217;).</p>
<p>Here it is law-based, in reference, for example, to all those boy-kings of our early royal history (how many can you name????) – whose legitimacy is the most important thing of all, taking priority over minor considerations such as&#8230; oh, I don&#8217;t know, BEING OLDER THAN SIX.</p>
<p><em>Infant </em>in this sense connotes something like having yet to earn freedom <em>sui juris</em>; the legal understanding that a person is fit to govern themselves (and, in royal cases, a country), and consequent <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/11/01/an-alphabet-of-femininism-5-%E2%80%93-e-is-for-emancipate/">emancipation</a> from the rule of parent, guardian or Lord Protector.</p>
<p>Among Spanish royals – to this day – children who are not the direct heir to the throne have the title<em> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_and_Castle#Name">Infante / Infanta</a></em>; presumably giving us English our third definition for<em> infant</em> (&#8216;a youth of noble birth&#8217;), these are princes of the blood, but they ain&#8217;t ruling nothing.</p>
<h3>Exit, Pursued by a Bear.</h3>
<p>It is also worth considering the more direct fate of infants&#8217; mothers: &#8216;The very being or legal existence of the women is suspended during marriage&#8217; wrote William Blackstone in 1765. A financial, legal and social dependent – like the children she bore – a wife could be &#8216;infantine&#8217; through her official speechlessness, than which there is no more perfect example than Coventry Patmore&#8217;s poem <em>The Angel in the House </em>(1854-62):</p>
<blockquote><p>He&#8217;s never young nor ripe; she grows</p>
<p>More infantine, auroral, mild,</p>
<p>And still the more she lives and knows</p>
<p>The lovelier she&#8217;s express&#8217;d a child.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yet, like the screaming infants littering Coram&#8217;s Fields, the silent appendage speaks vicariously: <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/10/18/an-alphabet-of-femininism-3-c-is-for-crinoline/">dress</a>, jewellery and inactivity declare her husband&#8217;s wealth and status; &#8216;mildness&#8217; and &#8216;loveliness&#8217; (like <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/11/15/an-alphabet-of-femininism-7-g-is-for-girl/">youth and innocence</a>) embody the ideals men battle to protect, with smatterings of the overpowering Rightness of the domestic sphere.</p>
<p>She remains, of course, firmly on her <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/10/25/an-alphabet-of-femininism-4-d-is-for-doll/">pedestal</a>, and statues, as we know, do not speak (unless they are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Winter's_Tale">late Shakespearean</a> and have the rather badass Paulina fighting their corner).</p>
<p>So being <em>infantilised </em>does not mean saying nothing; rather, it means saying what those around you choose to hear.</p>
