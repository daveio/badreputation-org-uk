										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://filmburble.wordpress.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Emily McQuade</strong></a> takes the guest post slot now. She last wrote <a href="/2013/02/27/guest-post-the-countess-is-waiting-for-you-daughters-of-darkness/" target="_blank">a highly amusing piece for us on the movie <strong>Daughters of Darkness</strong></a>, so we asked her to pick another favourite female monster from the silver screen for Halloween. Then the Ed wasn&#8217;t well for a bit, so we didn&#8217;t put the post up for a while. But here it is now! Do you have a guest pitch? Pitch that pitch to <a href="mailto:badrepeditors@gmail.com"><strong>badrepeditors@gmail.com</strong></a>!</em></li>
</ul>
<p>One thing to be aware of when watching any of Ken Russell’s films is that you will spend at least three quarters of the running time saying to yourself, ‘What THE HELL am I watching.’</p>
<p>Mr Russell’s <strong>The Lair of the White Worm</strong> (1988) is so bizarre that&#8230; well, let’s just take a look at the notes I made the last time I watched it: </p>
<blockquote><p>‘How do you spot a snake vampire cultist lady? She’ll be playing snakes and ladders. In thigh high boots.’ </p>
<p>‘Gratuitous historically inaccurate nun torture.’ </p>
<p>‘Where IS Peter Capaldi keeping that mongoose?’ </p></blockquote>

<p>(Unfortunately, Bram Stoker’s <strong>The Lair of the White Worm</strong> is not a great read. It’s got potential – Lovecraftian horrors stirring beneath the English countryside – but it’s clunky as hell. And contains so much sexism and racism that it reads like an unsubtle parody of a Victorian horror tale.) </p>
<p>Peter Capaldi plays Angus, an archaeology student who finds the skull of some kind of monster in the garden of a B&#038;B in Derbyshire. The B&#038;B is run by two sisters – Eve and Mary (Catherine Oxenberg and Sammi Davis. Note the unsubtle choice of names) whose mother has disappeared in mysterious circumstances. </p>
<p>Then Lord D’Ampton (Hugh Grant) invites them to his ancestral hall for an 80s folk/rock party, where he re-enacts the legendary tale of an ancestor of his, who killed a giant worm (guess what colour it was.) that was terrorising the village some centuries previously. </p>
<p>(The beast that his ancestor had the squabble with was the D’Ampton Worm. As in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambton_Worm" target="_blank">Lambton Worm</a>. Both Stoker’s and Russell’s version of ‘White Worm’ take place in Derbyshire and not Durham. There were a lot of worm monsters about in the olden days, apparently.)</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/LairWorm.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="14255" data-permalink="/2013/12/03/guest-post-lady-sylvia-lair-white-worm/lairworm/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/LairWorm.jpg?fit=600%2C862&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="600,862" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="LairWorm" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/LairWorm.jpg?fit=208%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/LairWorm.jpg?fit=600%2C862&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/LairWorm-208x300.jpg?resize=208%2C300" alt="LairWorm" width="208" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-14255" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/LairWorm.jpg?resize=208%2C300&amp;ssl=1 208w, https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/LairWorm.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w" sizes="(max-width: 208px) 100vw, 208px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>This gets Angus wondering – could his new-found skull have something to do with the one in the tale? Lord D’Ampton is foppishly sceptical. And then Lady Sylvia slinks into view. And spits venom on a crucifix. I haven’t seen <strong>Downton Abbey</strong> for ages, but I’m pretty sure that her TV namesake is not in  the habit of doing such things.</p>
<p>What follows is an unsettling campfest. Lady Sylvia does some horrible things (that poor boy scout) but she’s also horribly fascinating. I don’t know if she was meant to be a satire on the ‘sexy sex ladies who are EVIIILL’ trope or an unsubtle parody of 80s decadence (see Kate Beaton’s <a href="http://www.harkavagrant.com/index.php?id=285" target="_blank">marvellous Dracula cartoon</a> for a nice pisstake of how this trope came up in Stoker’s most famous tale). But either way Ms Donohue looks to be really enjoying herself. </p>
<p>Eve and Mary are sketchily drawn characters – it transpires that Eve is a virgin, which makes her sacrifice fodder for the great big worm beast living under Sylvia’s mansion (paging Doctor Freud). Lord D’Ampton has some rude dreams and tries to fix things with his super posh man skillz. Eventually, Angus has to face vamped up Sylvia alone. Yep, Peter Capaldi is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_girl" target="_blank">Final Girl</a>. </p>
<p>He does a bit of snake charming with a kilt and a set of bagpipes. And a mongoose. If anyone’s concerned that <strong>Doctor Who</strong>-loving kids might come across Malcolm Tucker’s epic swears by accident online, wait until they get a load of this.</p>
<p><strong>Lair of the White Worm</strong> is basically awesome trash. Or it’s trash cinema French kissing arthouse cinema down a dingy alleyway. And sometimes that’s what you want.</p>

<li><em>This guest post was originally pitched for Halloween &#8211; big apologies to our guest writer <a href="http://i-conoclastic.co.uk/illumination/" target="_blank"><strong>Ruth Sullivan</strong></a> that the ed being unwell prevented it going up earlier. We reckon it&#8217;s still a great read any time of the year (and if you&#8217;re in London and enjoying or about to start enjoying the BFI&#8217;s <a href="http://www.bfi.org.uk/gothic" target="_blank">Gothic season</a>, which runs into January, this is an excellent primer!). If you have a guest post a-brewing, <a href="mailto:badrepeditors@gmail.com?subject=pitch">email us on badrepeditors@gmail.com</a>.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The nights have drawn in, there’s a chill in the air and it’s that time of year where I like to do what I, admittedly, like to do pretty much the rest of the year: gather the family around a nice cosy horror film and scare the bejeezus out of ourselves.</p>

<p>Last year they ran a day of screenings that traversed the decades from the Thirties to the Seventies. It was fascinating to watch an intricate snapshot of women in horror unfolding before me, reflective of Hollywood&#8217;s complex relationship with sexuality, equality, objectification and empowerment.</p>
<p>In just the five films screened &#8211; <strong>Mad Love</strong>, <strong>The Cat People</strong>, <strong>Them</strong>, <strong>Plague of the Zombies</strong> and <strong>Phantasm</strong> &#8211; a gamut of femininity was presented, from virginal innocent to sexual seductress, strident powerful woman to flailing damsel in distress, repressed lesbian to swooning romantic.</p>
<p>In almost all these films there is a notable slide towards objectification; the woman’s body as a object of desire for the monster or mad scientist, the virginal sacrificial lamb, or the slutty cannon fodder helpless to avert her fate. This is reflective of the wider problems within a genre that still churns out women&#8217;s bodies to be fondled, fucked, kidnapped and sliced up.</p>
<p>The brilliant, feminist-principled <a href="http://www.womeninhorrormonth.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Women in Horror Recognition Month</strong></a> campaign<sup><a href="/2013/12/02/guest-post-our-sinister-sisters-the-girl-monster-on-screen/#footnote_0_14170" id="identifier_0_14170" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" Ed&rsquo;s Tiny Note: We were ambassadors for the 2013 WiHM campaign, and you can read the blogfest we curated for it here. ">1</a></sup> recognises this difficult relationship with horror. Their campaign illustrates that it can be one of the most objectifying genres, but is also an important genre for exploring a vast array of issues &#8211; power, psyche, politics, social constructs, war, violence, gender &#8211; and therefore that it’s important that women’s roles are recognised and supported.</p>
<p>They provide a platform for women directors, writers, actors and aficionados to get their work seen and to address issues within the industry, as well as misogyny in the genre. They&#8217;ve also used social media, blogging and film festivals to explore what horror has to contribute to the female narrative.</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Cat-People.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="14243" data-permalink="/2013/12/02/guest-post-our-sinister-sisters-the-girl-monster-on-screen/cat-people/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Cat-People.jpg?fit=220%2C294&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="220,294" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Cat People" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Cat-People.jpg?fit=220%2C294&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Cat-People.jpg?fit=220%2C294&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Cat-People.jpg?resize=220%2C294" alt="Cat People" width="220" height="294" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-14243" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>It’s a massive area to dig into. There’s been a swathe of material written about women as survivors in horror films &#8211; they occupy a myriad of roles: the Final Girl, the matriarch (all hail Ellen Ripley!), the victim who finds her nerve and the avenging angel survivor &#8211; frequently a victim of sexual violence. </p>
<p>It’s a rich seam to explore, and there’s a whole other vein to mine exploring the ones who live and the ones who die in horror movies, and what this represents metaphorically, culturally and politically. Equally, there’s a huge area to address when it comes to representations of race in horror &#8211; for example, why the last one to live is often a white woman (think <strong>Night of the Living Dead</strong>). But what about when women themselves are the stuff of nightmares?</p>
<p>Women aren&#8217;t always the victims in horror, and whilst there have been significant problems in the history of the genre, it has also been willing to explore areas of female experience that other genres just weren&#8217;t ready for, often at times when it would have been deeply contentious to make a film that discussed, say, sexuality or sexual violence, let alone the fact that you’d still be hard pushed to find a film about what a nightmare getting your period can be! There are numerous examples of fantastic writing and performances in horror that explore the feminine diabolique whilst also touching on real world issues underneath.</p>
<p>1936’s <strong>Dracula’s Daughter</strong> is a fine example of how horror can reflect both the cultural perception of women and the abiding social currents, as well as exploring key issues for women through the figure of a female monster. It was produced as part of the Universal stable of horror films, following directly on the heels of Tod Browning’s <strong>Dracula</strong>.</p>
<p>Gloria Holden plays the troubled and lonely Countess Zaleska, desperate to cure herself of vampirism. She tries both the occult and psychiatry before giving in to her bloodlust. The film is a Gothic delight, and Holden is dark and intense, quietly terrifying and tragic at the same time.</p>
<p>The film barely contains its sapphic undertones. Zaleska lingers over her female victims, covets their bodies and beauty, and prowls the streets at night in search of blood. The countess is very much a creature of her time in cinematic history, reflecting both the notion that homosexuality was considered a psychiatric malaise, and the censorship movements of the 1930s, with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Production_Code" target="_blank">Hays Code</a> being introduced just a few years before. This was the first regulation code for cinema, reflecting religious and conservative views that any deviant behaviour had to be hidden, including sexual acts, prostitution, white slavery and homosexuality. The film is also a shining example of the demonisation of homosexuality, the portrayal of lesbians as predatory and dangerous and this is reflected in the scene where Zaleska attacks a young model, Lili.</p>
<p>1942’s <strong>Cat People</strong> likewise has a female monster at its heart. Irena moves to New York from Serbia, falling in love with the charming Oliver and marrying him. Underneath the surface, however, is the secret that she is descended from a wild people who can turn themselves into cats. Irena seems convinced that if she gives in to her passions she will lose control and turn into a cat herself &#8211; and her marriage becomes strained by a lack of intimacy.</p>
<p>Again, there is subtext around psychology, sexual repression and the power in a woman unleashing her sexuality. There is also a queer subtext as Irena stalks her husband&#8217;s mistress, Alice, and her inner cat is unleashed, suggesting that the repression she felt was her sexuality rather than her lack of ardour for her husband. All this is neatly tucked away from the heavy-handed censors, but easily readable.</p>

Both films provided bold representations of female sex and sexuality at a time when it just wouldn&#8217;t have been possible to do so in a straightforward feature film. Although the subtext was ultimately tragic and fatal, it was a fair reflection of both the turmoil of coming to terms with being queer and the risk of society’s response if the fact was made public. Horror was the perfect cypher.</p>
<p>Moving forward, horror has continued to provide the perfect medium to explore these themes. The female monster has been a great platform for exploring puberty and all its commensurate delights: it’s all blood, mayhem and rage, after all. Think <strong>Carrie</strong> at the prom, exploding with fear, confusion and violence at her tormentors, triggered by her menstruation. Think Ginger in <strong>Ginger Snaps</strong> (2000) &#8211; first period, first full moon, morphing to discover her sense of identity, her confidence and her sexual liberation.</p>
<p>Both <strong>Carrie</strong> and <strong>Ginger Snaps</strong> are reflective of the fact that we are also still culturally trained to view periods and puberty with a sense of revulsion. There are several key moments in <strong>Ginger Snaps</strong> where adult characters view menstruation with disgust, implying that the girls should be ashamed of even speaking about it. Our bodies are the centre of the change in puberty, and this is interpreted into a kind of body horror, where the confusion, pain, hormones of puberty are projected outwards.</p>

Ginger starts to pay attention to and receive attention from her peers &#8211; she becomes a sexual being as well as a creature of rage. Bianca Nielson’s fascinating article <a href="http://www.thirdspace.ca/journal/article/viewArticle/nielsen/176" target="_blank"><strong>Something&#8217;s Wrong, Like More Than You Being Female</strong></a> delves even further into <strong>Ginger Snaps</strong>’ representation of puberty and is well worth a read.</p>
<p>What is great about the film is the way that Brigitte and Ginger deconstruct their experiences together, sharing their views of their society, their bodies, and of their relationships. It&#8217;s notable how isolated Brigitte becomes when she can no longer share Ginger’s experiences. Although these conversations revolve around the fantastical, trying to deal with Ginger’s ‘wolfing out’, they’re also painfully familiar.</p>
<p>The female monster also allows us opportunity to address expectations of the female body. Hammer has a lot to answer for when it comes to heaving bosoms and frail victims in flimsy nighties, but in <strong>Countess Dracula</strong> (1971) it also addressed ageing. In particular, it addressed the fear of no longer meeting the expectation that women should be beautiful, and the anxiety that to age means to no longer be desirable.</p>

Played by horror queen Ingrid Pitt, she was also rooted in the real life <strong>Elizabeth Bathory</strong>, who was imprisoned for murdering over 80 women and allegedly bathing in their blood. <strong>Countess Dracula</strong> is a silly, campy horror film, but it also manages to contain moments of poignancy, especially as the countess is forced to face her fate &#8211; old, hated and done for. It’s not a cheery message, but it&#8217;s a fair reflection of the cultural obsession with youth and beauty.</p>
<p>The girl monster also allows us to explore the idea that what’s outside doesn&#8217;t necessarily reflect what’s inside &#8211; ideas around appearances that fall outside the norms of society, the idea that ‘the other’ isn&#8217;t necessarily horrific, and the idea that monsters, conversely, can come in appealing packages. This is especially powerful when it challenges perceived notions of womanhood and beauty.</p>

She uses pain and piercing to control herself and to make her outside appearance reflect the badness she feels within, self-harming, cutting, modifying and piercing until she loses control. Again, on the surface it’s a silly film, but it’s a powerful scene when we begin to unpick the body as an object of aberration for young women. When Julie modifies herself she appears dangerous and sinister, but ultimately she’s still Julie underneath &#8211; she’s still a young woman mortified by herself.</p>
<p>This issue is also brilliantly addressed in last year&#8217;s breakthrough horror <strong>American Mary</strong>. Filmed by twins Jen and Sylvia Soska, and from their point of view explicitly feminist, it deals with the world of extreme body modification &#8211; carried out by trainee doctor Mary.</p>
<p>The modified women are deeply challenging representations of femininity and beauty. Their appearances are shocking and extreme, although underneath, they are caring and gentle despite seeming monstrous. This is exemplified by the character Ruby Realdoll, who desires to become sexless and doll-like. Her body has been cut and sliced to become featureless &#8211; monstrous to the accepted notion of beauty, but beautiful to her and vital to her self acceptance. The modification has dire consequences and accurately reflects how society rejects the other, often violently.</p>

In part, this is due to the societal pressures on her, including the fact that surgery is a boys&#8217; club from which she is excluded as a young woman. It is also in part caused by an awful attack carried out by someone who presents themselves as the nice guy &#8211; nice job, caring profession, well respected, known to Mary. It’s a very challenging scene, mostly because the directors don’t allow you to look away, and because they refuse to fetishise it to make it more bearable. Horror reflects reality &#8211; as the directors themselves said, there are no cutaways in real life.</p>
<p>Importantly, though, Mary is also not a particularly nice person. She looks stunning, but she is not what we expect. She is sharp edged, cold, and self-absorbed; neither a fluffy air-headed beauty nor a bookish high achiever. Horror allows us to subvert some accepted tropes and often spits cultural expectations and stereotypes back in our faces. The fact that <strong>American Mary</strong> has generated so much discussion about what is and isn’t feminist cinema is fantastic.</p>
<p>Mainstream cinema is still deeply prescriptive about how women can act, talk and be &#8211; the girl monster refuses to be chained by these prescriptions. Horror is a brilliant, bloody palate for our real issues, and as a result it&#8217;s provided a forum for us to to talk about being a woman in a way that other genres could only dream of.</p>
<p>Of course we should enjoy the thrill of being scared. Of course we should immerse ourselves in the delight of a silly campy horror or a terrifying splatterfest &#8211; and no, I&#8217;m not suggesting that every horror fest should be an exercise in cinematic analytical criticism. But I love our sinister sisters. They&#8217;ve been reclaiming the night for decades.</p>

<li><em>As a nod to Halloween, here&#8217;s our longtime friend Libby of the wonderful <a href="http://treasuryislands.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">TreasuryIslands</a> blog &#8211; check out <a href="/tag/libby/">her previous posts for us</a>.

</ul>
<p>Representations of witches and witchcraft in literature and in popular culture generally are incredibly useful to us, providing a way of critiquing the situation of women under patriarchy that is both effective and accessible.</p>
<p>Children’s literature is particularly rife with such representations. From the wicked women of Grimm and Perrault and folkloric creations like Baba Yaga and Ceridwen, through C.S. Lewis’ Jadis and the maleficent creations of Mary de Morgan to 20th century inventions like TH White’s Madam Mim and the female students of Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry, lady sorcerers &#8211; both good and evil &#8211; have never been far from the pages of the books we have used to educate and entertain our children.</p>
<p>The witches of the classic fairytales and of the stories of the Victorian era are usually monstrous and spiteful, using their magic in service of the Devil &#8211; or worse, their own self-interest. They taunt because they can and have few, if any, redeeming characteristics.</p>
<p>In recent decades the image of the image of the witch in popular culture has undergone a transformation, in no small part due to the witches that have appeared in juvenile literature. Since the 1970s, the stories our children have read have overwhelmingly featured good witches (though the frequency with which they are presented as inept deserves some attention). These are my favourites of the modern circle.</p>
<h2>Mildred Hubble</h2>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/mildredhubble.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="14164" data-permalink="/2013/10/30/guest-post-five-witches-from-childrens-literature/mildredhubble/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/mildredhubble.jpg?fit=297%2C285&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="297,285" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="mildredhubble" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/mildredhubble.jpg?fit=297%2C285&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/mildredhubble.jpg?fit=297%2C285&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/mildredhubble.jpg?resize=297%2C285" alt="mildredhubble" width="297" height="285" class="alignright size-full wp-image-14164" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Created when Jill Murphy was a teenager, <a href="http://www.puffin.co.uk/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780141314501,00.html" target="_blank"><strong>The Worst Witch</strong></a> series follows the adventures of Mildred Hubble as she navigates the social and academic challenges of Miss Cackle’s Academy, a draughty old castle that perches atop a thickly forested mountain and ‘looks more like a prison than a school’.</p>
<p>It’s an uncomfortable enough environment for a youngster to be in, but Mildred has an added disadvantage, being marked as an outsider by her unkempt appearance and her tabby cat (given to her when the rest of the girls receive sleek black kitties).</p>
<blockquote><p>She was one of those people who always seem to be in trouble. She didn’t exactly mean to break rules and annoy the teachers, but things just seemed to happen when Mildred was around.</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>The Worst Witch</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The young witch is thoroughly well-meaning and a little too clever for her own good, but she’s also bumbling and frequently wrangling with authority figures. Despite her perceived inadequacies, there’s an air of serendipity that follows her around; her failures and misdeeds inevitably lead to a positive outcome of much greater consequence than the proceeding mishap.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is why she is so well-loved by young readers and so fondly remembered by adults. Often we can see a little of ourselves in Mildred &#8211; from her practical incompetence to her trailing shoe laces, she’s a reminder that you don’t have to be perfect to be wonderful.</p>

The protagonist of the book (and its sequel, <a href="http://www.celiarees.com/books/sorceress.html" target="_blank"><strong>Sorceress</strong></a>) is Mary Newbury, an adolescent witch forced to flee to the New World following the violent death of her grandmother at the hands of<br />
witch-hunters.</p>
<p>Caught between a desire to be true to herself and the hypocrisy of Puritanism, Mary is headstrong, smart, empathetic and brave. She exhibits a tolerance that is unusual for her era and generally makes herself an excellent role model for young readers.</p>
<p>For Mary, independence poses a threat &#8211; she lives in a time that fears capable women, and her agency and determination could lead her to the same fate as her grandmother. But still she forges onwards, using her wit and her alacrity to light the way and finding friendship and love among another marginalised group.</p>
<blockquote><p>I should flee, get away. They will turn on me next unless I go. But where to? What am I to do? Lose myself. Die in the forest. I look around. Eyes, hard with hatred, slide from mine. Mouths twitch between leering and sneering. I will not run away into the forest, because that is what they want me to do.</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>Witch Child</strong></p></blockquote>

But there is an incongruency to Pratchett’s feminism which undermines his intended message and ultimately, <strong>Discworld</strong> is, whisper it, <em>not that feminist</em>.</p>
<p>Tiffany Aching is, to paraphrase her creator, the most feminist of the feminists that he does not have. A child savant, she begins her witching career at nine years old when she embarks upon a quest to save her brother from a sinister fairyland <em>a la</em> <strong>Labyrinth</strong>. She’s got common sense and amazing chutzpah. While remaining a completely believable pre-teen, she’s shrewd, smart and she will not be condescended to.</p>
<blockquote><p>‘Zoology, eh? That’s a big word, isn’t it?’<br />
‘No, actually it isn’t,’ said Tiffany. ‘Patronising is a big word. Zoology is quite short.’</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>The Wee Free Men</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>As Tiffany grows up (she is approaching 16 at the time of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Shall-Wear-Midnight-Discworld-Novels/dp/0552166057" target="_blank"><strong>I Shall Wear Midnight</strong></a>) It becomes clear that she is the natural successor to Granny Weatherwax, the number one witch of the <strong>Discworld</strong> series, as she begins to display magical abilities rare in people of her age as well as exhibiting characteristics she shares with her mentor &#8211; gravitas, knowledge, a tendency towards literalism and the belief that a witch should remain single. Tiffany will ultimately become a better witch than Granny, and it is a pleasure to watch her get there.</p>
<h2>Minerva McGonagall</h2>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/SmithMcGonagallHP71.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="14155" data-permalink="/2013/10/30/guest-post-five-witches-from-childrens-literature/smithmcgonagallhp7-2/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/SmithMcGonagallHP71.jpg?fit=284%2C177&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="284,177" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="SmithMcGonagallHP7" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/SmithMcGonagallHP71.jpg?fit=284%2C177&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/SmithMcGonagallHP71.jpg?fit=284%2C177&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-14155" alt="SmithMcGonagallHP7" src="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/SmithMcGonagallHP71.jpg?resize=284%2C177" width="284" height="177" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Transfiguration Mistress &#8211; and latterly Deputy Headmistress &#8211; at Hogwarts, Minerva McGonagall is both wise and motherly, embodying a binary that women are frequently told they cannot.</p>
<p>McGonagall cares for her charges deeply, but not blindly. She is fair and ethical and has gained great respect within the Hogwarts hierarchy. She’s often sharp with students and teachers alike, she’s a keen believer in rules &#8211; without being mindlessly bound to them &#8211; and she’s a fan of order in her classroom.</p>
<p>With a witty remark or condescending quip never far from her thin lips, Minerva McGonagall is a force to be reckoned with.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8216;Oh, I can&#8217;t wait to see McGonagall inspected,&#8217; said Ron happily. &#8216;Umbridge won&#8217;t know what&#8217;s hit her.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Though she is a slight woman in her seventies, McGonagall is a fearless combatant in the battle that rages at the close of the series, directing the action and engaging directly with Voldemort in defence of the institution and the people that she loves.</p>
<p>There are many women in JK Rowling&#8217;s <strong>Harry Potter</strong> series that display fine qualities &#8211; caring and protective Mrs Weasley; book-smart Hermione; fearless Tonks; even Delores Umbridge can be admired for her sheer bloodymindedness and determination. But McGonagall seems to embody all these qualities and then some.</p>
<h2>Winnie the Witch</h2>
<blockquote><p>Winnie the Witch lived in a black house in the forest. The house was black on the outside and black on the inside. The carpets were black. The chairs were black. The bed was black and it had black sheets and black blankets. Even the bath was black.</p>
<p>Winnie lived in her black house with her cat, Wilbur. He was black too. And that is how the trouble began.</p>

<p>Created by Valerie Thomas and illustrated by Korky Paul, she’s a comical character by design, gangly and tall with an unruly mane of black hair and a reddened nose that I like to imagine comes from a fondness for gin. When we first meet her, she is the only colourful thing in a very dark world. A series of books for middle grade readers featuring Winnie is <a href="http://www.winnie-the-witch.com/the-authors.php" target="_blank">also available</a>, written by Laura Owen.</p>
<p>But Winnie has no qualms over using her magic to amend the world around her to suit her own purposes without considering the consequences. Winnie is heedless and impulsive, with a catch-all cry of &#8216;ABRACADABRA&#8217; that, predictably, gets her into scrapes.</p>
<p>She learns from her blunders, though, and she puts things right with grace and unerrring joy. Winnie the Witch lives a hedonistic life and she makes mistakes, but she’s always got a genuine smile on her face and that’s what makes her so refreshing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li><em><strong>Alyson Macdonald</strong>, who blogs for <a href="http://brightgreenscotland.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Bright Green</strong></a>, sent us this review. She&#8217;s previously written badass posts for us on the feminist issues in issue 1 of Kieron Gillen and Kamie McKelvie&#8217;s <a href="/2013/01/31/guest-post-young-avengers-1-sex-and-the-female-gaze/" target="_blank"><strong>Young Avengers</strong></a> and <a href="/2013/01/09/guest-post-found-feminism-rewatching-dirty-dancing/" target="_blank"><strong>Dirty Dancing</strong></a>.

</ul>
<p>Writer <a href="http://mattfraction.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Matt Fraction</strong></a> and artist <a href="http://zdarsky.tumblr.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Chip Zdarsky</strong></a> have created a warm and intelligent comic with an overtly pro-feminist take on sex and relationships. Don&#8217;t let the fact that it&#8217;s called <strong>Sex Criminals</strong> put you off – the title is a play on words and refers to the main characters&#8217; ability to literally stop time when they have sex, which they use to carry out bank robberies.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/sexcriminals1-cover.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="14092" data-permalink="/2013/09/30/guest-post-review-sex-criminals/sexcriminals1-cover/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/sexcriminals1-cover.jpg?fit=596%2C900&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="596,900" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="sexcriminals1-cover" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/sexcriminals1-cover.jpg?fit=198%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/sexcriminals1-cover.jpg?fit=596%2C900&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-14092 alignright" alt="Cover for Sex Criminals issue 1" src="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/sexcriminals1-cover.jpg?resize=271%2C409" width="271" height="409" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/sexcriminals1-cover.jpg?w=596&amp;ssl=1 596w, https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/sexcriminals1-cover.jpg?resize=198%2C300&amp;ssl=1 198w" sizes="(max-width: 271px) 100vw, 271px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a surreal concept, and one which is difficult to write well, but Fraction has built a successful career out of telling these kinds of stories, and is skilled in persuading readers to suspend their disbelief.</p>
<p>In <strong>Sex Criminals</strong>, time is not presented as strictly linear: events are shown out of sequence, and the adult version of the lead character Suzie narrates scenes from her adolescence, sometimes even appearing next to her younger self on the page. This time-travel effect makes it easier for the reader to accept Suzie&#8217;s time-stopping powers, while also establishing her as our link to the story.</p>
<p>By choosing a female lead character, writer Fraction is challenging popular culture&#8217;s tendency to shy away from female leads, as well as the relative taboo of women&#8217;s sexuality.</p>
<p>In particular, his willingness to discuss female masturbation is refreshing because, while male wanking is openly discussed, joked about, and accepted as a fact of life, there&#8217;s still a lingering sense that it&#8217;s dirty when women do it.</p>
<p>Early on in the comic, we see young Suzie discovering the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYzlVDlE72w" target="_blank">Greatest Love of All</a> in the bath, and it&#8217;s dealt with in a sensitive, not overtly-eroticised way &#8211; adult Suzie, narrating while fully clothed and perched on the edge of the bathtub, is the focus of the panel.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/SC1.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="14082" data-permalink="/2013/09/30/guest-post-review-sex-criminals/sc1/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/SC1.jpg?fit=802%2C352&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="802,352" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="SC1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/SC1.jpg?fit=300%2C131&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/SC1.jpg?fit=802%2C352&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-14082" alt="Panel from Sex Criminals 1. Suzie discusses her first orgasm." src="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/SC1.jpg?resize=578%2C254" width="578" height="254" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/SC1.jpg?w=802&amp;ssl=1 802w, https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/SC1.jpg?resize=300%2C131&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 578px) 100vw, 578px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Although we are aware that young Suzie is masturbating in this scene, the aim is not to sexualise her but to introduce her orgasm-related superpower, so the masturbation is less important than what happens immediately afterwards. In a pastiche of the old comics trope of an ordinary kid acquiring superpowers when they hit puberty, Suzie realises that time stops when she comes. Here, Fraction takes an inspired dig at the state of sex education in American schools, because Suzie has no idea whether her experience is normal, and she&#8217;s forced to rely on the dubious wisdom of a classmate when the adults won&#8217;t answer her questions.</p>
<p>Despite this, Suzie eventually becomes more confident about sex, and it&#8217;s made very clear to the reader that when she has sex with a partner it&#8217;s her choice to do so. As the narrator, she informs us that the first time she slept with her high school boyfriend Craig she had decided to do so in advance, and we see her enjoy the experience, even though it doesn&#8217;t live up to her expectation that it would be a profound, life-changing event. From a feminist point of view, the most interesting of the comic&#8217;s sex scenes is Suzie&#8217;s first encounter with Jon, who has just been introduced as the love interest. Jon explicitly checks for consent before initiating physical contact, in a way that seems natural, relaxed, and pretty damn sexy.</p>

<p>The admirable gender politics of the writing are perfectly complemented by Zdarsky&#8217;s art, which fits perfectly with a comic which is played for laughs as much as for titillation. It isn&#8217;t drawn in an overtly erotic style, and there isn&#8217;t as much nudity as you might expect. The fact that the art isn&#8217;t wank-bank material in and of itself highlights the more cerebral aspects of Suzie&#8217;s attraction to Jon; they fancy one another, but their interest is sparked by shared interests over looks.</p>
<p>The art is also key to conveying the comic&#8217;s humour, whether it&#8217;s in Craig&#8217;s ridiculous gurning expression when he&#8217;s frozen in time right at the point of orgasm, or the crude drawings of nonsensical sex acts that Rachelle uses to explain “the real raw sex shit” to teenage Suzie. There are also a range of less obvious visual gags worked into the art in backgrounds or on characters&#8217; clothes, including numerous references to a celebrity called “Sexual Gary” who appears to be a pin-up figure for teenage girls.</p>

<p>Although <strong>Sex Criminals</strong> is a very funny comic, it also has emotional depth. The scenes from Suzie&#8217;s adolescence aren&#8217;t solely about her sexual development, but also deal with her father&#8217;s sudden death and her mother&#8217;s difficulty in coping afterwards. Young Suzie&#8217;s reactions are balanced by the narration from her adult self, creating a richer and more satisfying narrative.</p>
<p>Sex comedies can often disappoint feminists, but <strong>Sex Criminals</strong> shows that writers don&#8217;t have to rely on tired sexist stereotypes when writing jokes about sex, and that decent gender politics don&#8217;t have to be po-faced and humourless. Whether you&#8217;re a devoted comics fan or simply curious, this one is definitely worth a look.</p>

<p>According to Eli Roth, it was a conscious choice for the first example of nudity in <strong>Hostel II</strong> (2007) to be that of a man. Following the credit sequence and a quick catch up with <strong>Hostel</strong> survivor Paxton (Jay Hernandez), we’re introduced to our victims.</p>
<p>Far from the seedy lights of Amsterdam, these beautiful college-age women are in a life drawing class in Rome. Within thirty seconds, the male nude is replaced by a female model, Axelle (Vera Jordanova), who disrobes to the sound of audible gasps. Her gaze lingers on our main character, Beth (Lauren German). Beth grits her teeth, her forehead puckered into a tense frown as she begins to sketch.</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/beth-and-axelle1.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="13614" data-permalink="/2013/05/14/guest-post-jeans-no-heels-gender-sexuality-in-eli-roths-hostel-part-22/beth-and-axelle-2/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/beth-and-axelle1.jpg?fit=454%2C303&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="454,303" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="beth and axelle" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/beth-and-axelle1.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/beth-and-axelle1.jpg?fit=454%2C303&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright  wp-image-13614" alt="Beth and Axelle talk in Hostel 2" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/beth-and-axelle1.jpg?resize=363%2C242" width="363" height="242" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>“Jeans, no heels,” is what Beth says when asked if she’s packed for their upcoming trip to Prague with friends Whitney and Lorna. Beth may as well be called Sidney or Laurie: she is masculinised, her relationship with the female model Axelle is eroticised (Whitney even jokingly refers to Axelle as Beth’s &#8216;girlfriend&#8217;) and it is revealed that Beth keeps her father on an allowance following the death of her wealthy mother.</p>
<p>Beth and Axelle’s encounters are carefully structured to be titillating, and yet Beth’s sexuality is never openly discussed. Compared to the view of male homosexuality depicted in the first <strong>Hostel</strong> film, we’re in full-on homophobic fratboy territory here: lesbians are hot (as long as they’re young, slim and not too gay), and gay men are scary and have to be repressed.</p>
<p><strong>Hostel II</strong> differs to <strong>Hostel</strong> in that we get a deeper understanding of how the whole operation works, focalised through two American clients, Todd and Stuart. “This isn’t like going to a whorehouse,” Todd explains to reluctant Stuart after they successfully bid a collective $100,000 on securing Whitney and Beth as their torture victims. “You can’t just back out.”</p>
<p>Roth works hard to ensure the viewer feels an iota of sympathy for Stuart: he is de-masculinised by a practical and demanding wife, he lacks charisma, and he has to be cajoled into the Hostel experience by the powerhouse Todd. Todd compares their first kill to losing their virginity; Stuart pensively asks, “Do you think we’re sick?”</p>
<p>“We’re the normal ones,’ Todd replies, taking a deep sniff of cocaine. As they draw up to the factory, a mournful serenade plays as we see the doubt flicker across Stuart’s face. Roth asks us to feel sympathy for someone who has essentially been peer-pressured into paying vast sums of money to torture a woman – who intentionally resembles his wife, no less – to death.</p>

The rich are powerful and the powerful are rich: the notion of power, and an individual’s lack of control over their own fate, presents a contemporary spin on the 18th century fear of the aristocracy, often portrayed through a vampiric allegory along the lines of Dracula.</p>
<p><strong>Hostel II</strong> even includes a female client who pays hard cash to writhe – naked, naturally – in an Elizabeth Bathory-esque tub as the blood of virginal Lorna showers down upon her bare skin. It’s interesting to note that this is one of the few onscreen deaths of torture victims: the franchise often shies away from the so-called money shot (another grotesque connection between torture flicks and pornography).</p>
<p>Additionally, the fact that the only female client – aside from a stern silver-haired horsey type who unsuccessfully bids on the trio – chooses to murder her victim in this rather specifically vain method reinforces the assertion that for women, beauty is a matter of life and death. (This is also articulated in <strong>Hostel</strong> when the infamous “eyeball” woman catches sight of her mutilated face and throws herself from the arms of safety to certain death under a speeding train).</p>
<p>The fate of Whitney is grisly: she is made up ‘for the client’ in a corset and smudged, clownish make up. Todd gets cold feet, and so she is offered around and sold to the highest bidder. Sensitive Stuart finds his sea legs and takes her on as a warm up for Beth, who is dressed in a suit and made to even further resemble his wife.</p>
<p>How does Beth survive? She seduces him, naturally, then chops his dick off and pays her way out because she’s stinkin’ freakin’ rich. Let’s not forget her place, though: after negotiating with the Alan Sugar of the Hostel world, she is bent over a table and tattooed on the small of her back, rather than her bicep, ankle or, oh I don’t know, anywhere on her body that wouldn’t liken the process to being fucked from behind.</p>
<p>In a world in which <strong>The Human Centipede</strong> exists (and actually manages to generate enough revenue to produce a sequel), the so-called “torture porn” movement seems to have finally tipped over the edge into self-parody. The golden age for splatter flicks was 2002-2007. Since then, things seemed to have waned.</p>
<p>The biggest horror titles of 2012 suggest a rekindled preference for things that go bump in the night, with poltergeists, paranormal happenings and possession pictures enjoying a rise in popularity. The washed-up sequels of classic Splat Pack originals, such as <strong>Hostel III</strong> and <strong>Saw</strong> ad infinitum, are slinking off into the background &#8211; and good riddance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li><em>Today we’re honoured to welcome <a href="https://twitter.com/smokintofu" target="_blank"><strong>Alice Slater</strong></a> to the BadRep Towers soapbox for the first of two posts. Wanna join the party? Send your pitch to <a href="mailto:badrepeditors@gmail.com"><strong>badrepeditors@gmail.com</strong></a>!</em></li>
</ul>
<p>It’s unsurprising to learn that the big names in the so-called “torture porn” movement are all blokes. Known as the Splat Pack, James Wan (<strong>Saw</strong>, <strong>Dead Silence</strong>), Alexandre Aja (<strong>The Hills Have Eyes</strong>), Eli Roth (<strong>Cabin Fever</strong>, <strong>Hostel</strong>), Greg McLean (<strong>Wolf Creek</strong>), Rob Zombie (<strong>House of 1000 Corpses</strong>, <strong>Halloween</strong>) and Darren Lynn Bousman (<strong>Saw II-IV</strong>) all specialise in a brand of horror that leans heavily on sadism and graphic onscreen gore – the more creative and toe-curlingly disgusting, the better.</p>
<p>Eli Roth met a wave of criticism for the gender roles in <strong>Hostel</strong> (2005), a film in which all the women are either sex workers, hypersexualised and morally repugnant, strung out on enough narcotics to render them completely obsolete as anything other than onscreen ass, or all of the above (with the exception of two Japanese twentysomething tourists, who are portrayed as giggling and coquettish – the stereotypical western idealisation of Japanese women as schoolgirlish and subservient).</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/404px-Hostel_poster.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="13609" data-permalink="/2013/05/13/guest-post-you-just-take-them-gender-sexuality-in-eli-roths-hostel-part-12/404px-hostel_poster/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/404px-Hostel_poster.jpg?fit=404%2C599&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="404,599" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="404px-Hostel_poster" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/404px-Hostel_poster.jpg?fit=202%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/404px-Hostel_poster.jpg?fit=404%2C599&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright  wp-image-13609" alt="Poster for Hostel" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/404px-Hostel_poster.jpg?resize=283%2C419" width="283" height="419" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Roth, being a sensitive chap at heart, created <strong>Hostel Part II</strong> as a response – kind of like Neil Marshall hopping from <strong>Dog Soldiers</strong> to <strong>The Descent</strong>. Nice try, Eli. The gender politics are equally terrible in <strong>Hostel II</strong>. I know &#8211; “I can’t believe it!” said absolutely no one.</p>
<p>Now, horror isn’t the most feminist genre, but it’s my genre of choice. Female nudity, themes of female virginity and scenes of a sexual nature are prevalent in horror, from chaste Janet Leigh’s infamous shower scene to the chesticular fireworks of <strong>Piranha 3DD</strong>. Sex and death – the circle of life, as Sir Elton calls it – are intrinsically linked, and often sit well side by side. We all know what the phrase “torture porn” refers to, but there’s a problematic duality created by suggesting that sadistic violence and sexual gratification are titillating in the same way. It reduces the whole horror genre to something akin to <strong>Bizarre</strong> magazine: <em>Blood! Tits! Tits covered in blooood!</em></p>
<p><strong>Hostel</strong> opens with an unsympathetic bunch of lads on tour as they weave through the streets of Amsterdam. The group laugh at sensitive, still-getting-over-his-ex Josh (Derek Richardson) for suggesting they take a break from smoking pot and chasing skirt to check out a museum or two. Then they fistbump and hi-five their way through the Red Light District. It leaves us all feeling well primed for the next hour and a half of blood, guts and dismemberment because they are quite possibly the most unlikeable people in the history of humanity (apart from Jeremy Clarkson, who retains his crown of The Worst).</p>
<p>“Paying to go into a room to do whatever you want to someone isn’t exactly a turn-on,” says Sensitive Josh, and we all cock our heads and recognise that he is <em>definitely</em> going to die. The anti-sex work comparison drawn between prostitution and the premise of <strong>Hostel</strong> – the rich paying high prices to torture and kill others – doesn’t go unnoticed.</p>
<p>Loutish and drunk, the lads are denied entrance to their hostel. As a rain of glass bottles smashes around their feet, an eastern European tourist offers refuge in his hostel room. Here, Sensitive Josh awkwardly explains the definition of ‘clitoris’ (“Women have it? It’s like right near the labia? Like, it hangs?”) and talk naturally turns to sex.</p>
<p>“Looking for girls?” their new friend Alex asks. He then creepily shows them photos of himself having sex with women “so hot, you won’t believe it”. He explains that the women of Bratislava “go crazy for any foreigner. You just… take them.”</p>
<p>After hearing one of the most chilling phrases in the history of patriarchy, off the threesome go to Bratislava. A creep on the train confirms that eastern European women are smokin’ hot and DTF. He then places a hand on Sensitive Josh’s thigh and Josh reacts as though he&#8217;s just had his Achilles tendons cut (and we can be accurate here because that is <em>exactly</em> what happens to him approximately twenty minutes later).</p>
<p>This brief moment of casual homophobia is not to be overlooked: Josh, the sensitive one, the most respectful and the least sexually repugnant of the three, later places his hand on this man’s thigh in a sincere yet hesitant apology – moments after being called a “faggot” by Paxton. “I would have done the same thing at your age,” the man says, regarding Josh’s extreme and aggressive reaction to the hand-on-thigh moment from before. “It’s not easy, but from my experience, choosing to have a family was the right choice for me. Now I have my little girl, who means more to me than anything. But you should do what’s right for you.”</p>
<p>Hold on, what? It’s no coincidence that the next shot is of Josh ‘making his choice’ – on the brink of having sex with an incredibly attractive woman. Because of course, sexuality is a choice and the option of having a family is strictly for those that choose ‘straight’.</p>
<p>Anyway, the hostel is everything they imagined and more: slender young women shoot them come-hither looks, are totally chill to hang out in the spa with their tits out, and laugh at their inane jokes. Reader, our trio of lads go dancing, pop pills and eventually fuck their roommates to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMSFSG7NVIo" target="_blank"><strong>Willow’s Song</strong></a>, the alluring siren’s song performed by Britt Eckland as she seduces the copper in 1973’s hit cult flick <strong>The Wicker Man</strong> (incidentally, another movie about a community seducing and eventually murdering outsiders).</p>
<p>The problem? These are not sexually liberated tourists, having a laugh and shagging a bunch of goons for the fun of it. They, like Willow of <strong>The Wicker Man</strong>, are duplicitous: the sex is the primer for the betrayal, because we all know that sexually liberated women are up to no good.</p>

<li><em>Here&#8217;s Part 2 of <a href="http://www.rarelywearslipstick.com">Rarely Wears Lipstick</a> founder and blogger <strong>Lori Smith</strong>&#8216;s guest post two-parter (which is possibly mildly NSFW depending on how relaxed your workplace is!) <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2013/03/26/guest-post-lingerie-women-and-eroticism-a-brief-study-of-the-21st-century-agent-provocateur-woman-part-12/">Read Part 1 here</a>.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>Part 2: The Myth of the Agent Provocateur Woman</h2>
<p>If it is understood that the dominant discourse still pertains to heterosexual and patriarchal ideologies, Agent Provocateur was certainly aiming to challenge this in 2008. The brochure for their Spring/Summer collection that year contains many examples of non-heteronormative behaviour.</p>
<p>A model in a swimming costume and stilettos <a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AP2.jpg?resize=547%2C410" target="_blank">stands in front of a seated, similarly attired woman</a>, who touches her leg and looks up to her. Two women in satin lingerie and high heels are seen walking together – one has her hand on the other’s buttocks. A woman in animal print lingerie brandishes a spanking paddle and leans over an anonymous prostrate naked woman, whilst holding a rope that is attached to the submissive woman’s neck like a leash. An anonymous red-haired woman straddles a seated gasping woman whose arm is being stroked by a blonde in lingerie, brandishing a riding crop. Another woman, who is standing with her legs apart and her hands on her hips, watches an athletic female pole dancer. A topless woman in a red wig climbs on top of a woman in lingerie who lies, restrained, on a table.</p>
<p>There are also many examples of dominant female behaviour. Two women in bright coloured wigs and lingerie tie up and blindfold a clothed man on his knees. A man in underwear stands, with hands tied behind his back, displaying marks on his chest that suggest he has been struck by the riding crop held by the woman to his left. A handcuffed man is disrobed by a woman, whilst another woman records the scene using a professional video camera. A man lying restrained on a table, has his trousers unzipped by a lingerie-clad woman who is holding a glass of brandy and is staring directly at the viewer.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AP4.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="13398" data-permalink="/2013/03/26/guest-post-lingerie-women-and-eroticism-a-brief-study-of-the-21st-century-agent-provocateur-woman-part-12/ap4/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AP4.jpg?fit=640%2C480&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="640,480" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="AP4" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AP4.jpg?fit=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AP4.jpg?fit=640%2C480&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13398" alt="AP4" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AP4.jpg?resize=540%2C380" width="540" height="380" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>In this image, the Agent Provocateur woman is powerful yet playful. She is passionate, determined to satisfy her own desires and, from the facial expressions depicted, is clearly enjoying herself. She is active, not passive, and has agency.</p>
<p>However, in the 2012 brochure, the Agent Provocateur woman appears to have little or no agency. She faces the camera as if directed to by the photographer and is entirely the subject of the gaze – continually watching herself. This appears to be a return to the woman John Berger describes in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ways_of_Seeing" target="_blank"><strong>Ways of Seeing</strong></a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>She has to survey everything she is and everything she does because how she appears to others, and ultimately how she appears to men, is of crucial importance for what is normally thought of as the success of her life.</p></blockquote>
<p>There is little or no resistance to dominant discourses in the images contained within this brochure. All of the women appear sexually available, but are inviting sex rather than pursuing it. A woman stands in lingerie and heels next to a similarly attired seated woman, both facing the viewer with their legs apart. A woman kneels on a velvet chair, glancing over her shoulder at the viewer, with her buttocks prominently displayed. A woman in lingerie reclines on a chaise longue. A seated woman with her legs apart, hand on hip, stares at the viewer. There is no interaction between these women, even when more than one appears in the same image. Their only purpose is to invite the viewer’s gaze.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AP10.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="13409" data-permalink="/2013/03/27/guest-post-lingerie-women-and-eroticism-a-brief-study-of-the-21st-century-agent-provocateur-woman-part-22/ap10/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AP10.jpg?fit=640%2C480&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="640,480" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="AP10" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AP10.jpg?fit=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AP10.jpg?fit=640%2C480&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-13409" alt="AP10" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AP10.jpg?resize=448%2C336" width="448" height="336" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://joc.sagepub.com/content/6/2/177.abstract" target="_blank">Christian Jantzen and others</a> conducted a series of interviews with white middle class women in Denmark. The results suggested that these women wear delicate lingerie in order to achieve a sensation rather than a look. They wear it for how it makes them feel – confident, sensual, happy and satisfied – not necessarily for how they will be perceived by their partner. Some of the interviewees even admitted that the men in their lives do not understand their desire for exquisite lingerie. For them, the purchase and wearing of beautiful expensive underwear is about much more than just sex. It is about identity, pleasure, knowing how to dress for the right occasion, and, occasionally, projecting a desired alternate self-image:</p>
<blockquote><p>The importance of lingerie to most of our respondents is due to the fact that this kind of garment enables them to demonstrate that they can manage a modern femininity. By adhering to a certain scheme of classification, they show how they master their performance in different situations. This confirms their <em>social self</em>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Their research suggests that presenting lingerie as something to be enjoyed by the viewer rather than the wearer would not appeal to women. Even if this is not always true of women outside of their small study sample, I would argue that the current representation of the Agent Provocateur woman would therefore not appeal to the customer the brand originally sought to attract.</p>
<p>To conclude, the Agent Provocateur woman’s identity is, like the identity of every woman, shaped by discourse and the ideologies she is exposed to. If the woman is surrounded by, and part of, discourse which challenges what is currently dominant, she will herself become part of a reverse discourse. Agent Provocateur was originally conceived by Corré and Rees as a celebration of femininity, and the initial representation of the Agent Provocateur woman emphasised the performativity of her gender and her rejection of the patriarchal ideologies so often present in lingerie advertising.</p>
<p>Although the association between Agent Provocateur lingerie and this playfully erotic yet not passive lifestyle is purely arbitrary, it was exceedingly easy for customers to see the brand’s values and decide whether or not they wished to adopt them. Through the act of putting on this particular brand of quality exotic lingerie, a customer would create her sense of self, create her gender and transform her life into that of the Agent Provocateur woman. All of this was successfully conveyed in the promotional images and advertising for the brand up until at least 2008.</p>
<p>In looking at the differences between the images used to promote the Spring/Summer 2008 collection and those of the Autumn/Winter 2012 collection, it could be argued that the sale of the brand to a multinational company had an effect on how the Agent Provocateur woman was represented. The brand’s ideal woman appears to now offer far less resistance to current discourses on gender, sexuality and femininity than she did when Corré and Rees first sought to use lingerie as a way to disrupt and question the fashion status quo.</p>
<p>In expanding the market for the brand, the new owners appear to be attempting to create erotic lingerie that does not offend, thus diluting the original ethos of Agent Provocateur. Perhaps it is the current discourse which has changed, or maybe the Agent Provocateur woman simply works with the current discourse rather than against it? However, it could also be claimed that what is considered to be erotic is entirely subjective.</p>

<li><em>Having had an awesome time at the <a href="http://www.rarelywearslipstick.com/2013/03/rwl-awards-the-winners/" target="_blank">Rarely Wears Lipstick Awards</a>, in which we were nominated for Best Feminist Blog (and congrats to <a href="http://stavvers.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Stavvers</a>, the fabulous winner!) we are very happy to have RWL founder and blogger <strong>Lori Smith</strong> back to BadRep Towers for a two-parter (which is possibly NSFW depending on how relaxed your workplace is! Maybe skip the vid)&#8230;</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>Part 1: Agent Provocateur, Discourse and Performativity</h2>
<p>In 1971, Vivienne Westwood and Malcolm McLaren set up ‘Let it Rock’, their first King’s Road boutique. Their son Joseph Corré followed in his parents’ footsteps and opened a shop in London with his wife Serena Rees in 1994. Named <a href="http://www.agentprovocateur.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Agent Provocateur</strong></a>, the unusual boutique bridged a gap between the erotic lingerie sold in Soho’s sex shops and the respectable prettiness of the established quality brands sold in department stores.</p>
<p>Corré and Rees saw the brand as a vehicle for their creativity and their ideas about women and femininity. In 1995, they began a search for a woman who ‘would represent the concepts behind the clothes, model new designs, and be a spokesperson at upcoming events’. They saw the face of their brand as ‘charming, glamorous, curvy, independent and intelligent’ (see <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Agent-Provocateur-Celebration-Femininity-Sexuality/dp/1858687586" target="_blank"><strong>Agent Provocateur: A Celebration of Femininity</strong></a>).</p>
<p>The finalists of their competition were used as part of a publicity stunt at London Fashion Week, staging a demonstration against bland passionless fashion that drew the attention of the assembled press. After a decadent Miss Agent Provocateur Party had been held, where the winner was announced, Corré and Rees realised that a single woman couldn’t represent their brand’s values as the concept was too diverse. Every woman has the potential to become an agent provocateur.<br />
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AP1.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="13386" data-permalink="/2013/03/26/guest-post-lingerie-women-and-eroticism-a-brief-study-of-the-21st-century-agent-provocateur-woman-part-12/ap1/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AP1.jpg?fit=912%2C684&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="912,684" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="AP1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AP1.jpg?fit=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AP1.jpg?fit=912%2C684&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-13386 aligncenter" alt="Agent Provocateur invitation brochure page" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AP1.jpg?resize=438%2C328" width="438" height="328" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Corré and Rees have since divorced, and in 2007, Agent Provocateur was purchased by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3i" target="_blank">3i Group</a>. This gradually led to a significant change in how the Agent Provocateur woman was represented in the brand’s advertising campaigns. The brochure to showcase the Spring/Summer 2008 collection retained a lot of the ethos of Corré and Rees’ original vision. It has a cover designed to look like an invitation to an exclusive party, featuring the text ‘you are cordially invited to attend a very private affair […] Bring a blindfold and an open mind!’. Each image inside forms part of a digitally-created montage, with the pages containing small parts of the panoramic whole, unfolding to reveal one uninterrupted tableau.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AP2.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="13390" data-permalink="/2013/03/26/guest-post-lingerie-women-and-eroticism-a-brief-study-of-the-21st-century-agent-provocateur-woman-part-12/ap2/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AP2.jpg?fit=912%2C684&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="912,684" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="AP2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AP2.jpg?fit=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AP2.jpg?fit=912%2C684&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-13390 aligncenter" alt="Shot of models at party for AP brochure." src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AP2.jpg?resize=547%2C410" width="547" height="410" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>The models are depicted as attendees of the party and are engaging in activities of a sexual nature. Nothing pornographic is depicted, merely hints of erotic and light BDSM play. Most of the party guests are women, clothed in Agent Provocateur lingerie and swimwear, but there are also a number of men in the image. The women take both dominant and submissive roles, whilst the men are purely submissive.</p>

<p>Product information about the lingerie sets featured, such as name and price, is listed on the back of the image. With this choice of layout, it could be argued that the images are designed to be enjoyed first, and to be informative second.</p>

<p>By contrast, the Autumn/Winter 2012 collection is presented in a brochure containing separate images for each named set of lingerie, with the product details directly underneath each photograph. The theme of the collection is ‘Wilhelmina: Show Your True Self’ and the associated campaign focuses on a woman in Victorian London whose inner sensuality is revealed by a backstreet photographer’s magical camera.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/7DY728GDWI0" height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Each image contains between one and three female models, with little or no interaction between them. The women are not engaged in any activity other than modelling the clothing for the viewer, and are, as such, passive subjects of the gaze. Hair and make up is consistent throughout and maintains the look of a catwalk show, where the models are presented as a homogenous entity – a representation of how the brand’s woman should physically embody that season’s look.</p>

<p>Each model’s &#8216;true self&#8217; appears to be no different from the others. This presents us with a single type of Agent Provocateur woman, as opposed to the idea that she is present in all women, as Corré envisioned seventeen years previously.</p>

<p>It has often been suggested that the female body in lingerie is more erotic than the nude female body. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_Barthes" target="_blank">Roland Barthes</a> touches on this in his essay on striptease, published in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythologies_(book)" target="_blank"><strong>Mythologies</strong></a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Woman is desexualized at the very moment when she is stripped naked. We may therefore say that we are dealing in a sense with a spectacle based on fear, or rather on the pretence of fear, as if eroticism here went no further than a sort of delicious terror, whose ritual signs have only to be announced to evoke at once the idea of sex and its conjuration.</p></blockquote>
<p>At the very heart of the original concept of the Agent Provocateur brand, when it was founded by Corré and Rees, was the idea of lingerie as a ritual sign which evoked the idea of sex. Although they sought to design underwear which referenced socially acceptable quality French lingerie, eroticism was very much a part of Agent Provocateur’s core values. They made the brand accessible to women who would not normally venture into sex shops to purchase erotic lingerie.</p>
<p>It could be argued that Corré and Rees were also responding to dominant discourse on sexuality and gender when they set up Agent Provocateur in the 1990s. In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_History_of_Sexuality#Volume_I:_The_Will_to_Knowledge" target="_blank"><strong>The History of Sexuality Volume 1</strong></a>, Michel Foucault analyses changes in discourse on sexuality and argues that discourse is a productive force; for example, leading to definitions of “normal” and “other”. He also looks at the concept of docile bodies versus active agency, discussing reverse discourse as an empowering method of countering the dominant discourse.</p>
<p>There is little doubt that Agent Provocateur – whose name refers to an undercover agent employed to provoke suspects to commit illegal punishable acts – originally sought to engage in a reverse discourse on female sexuality. In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_History_of_Sexuality#Part_II:_The_Repressive_Hypothesis" target="_blank"><strong>The History of Sexuality Volume 2</strong></a>, Foucault delves further and discusses what he calls ‘techniques of the self’, emphasising the role of practices and instruments in generating a sense of self.</p>
<p>Clothing is very much a ‘technique of the self’. People use their clothes to transform, change and project a chosen image on a daily basis. Although society still often restricts the individual’s choice of outerwear, <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/12/19/found-feminism-agent-provocateur-the-chase/" target="_blank">unseen underwear</a> offers the wearer a sense of agency. Lingerie is considered by many to be an instrument in generating a sense of self, and it is worth considering here that the self is also shaped by gender.</p>
<p>It is widely understood that gender is a cultural construction that is shaped by discursive forces. One of the main issues considered by Judith Butler is the performativity of gender. Gender is not a performance – as that suggests the performer returns to a more genuine self once they leave the stage – but it is performative, as we are all constantly putting on an act. Lingerie is but one aspect of the act of femininity.</p>
<blockquote><p>Because there is neither an “essence” that gender expresses or externalizes nor an objective ideal to which gender aspires, and because gender is not a fact, the various acts of gender create the idea of gender, and without those acts, there would be no gender at all.</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>Judith Butler</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Therefore, what could possibly be more “womanly” than dressing oneself up in Agent Provocateur lingerie? In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_Trouble" target="_blank"><strong>Gender Trouble</strong></a>, Butler explores the spaces of resistance to dominant discourses. Like Foucault, and with reference to his work, she asks how we can go beyond the boundaries imposed on us by discourse, and explores the concept of agency. Gender and identity are more of a “doing” than a “becoming”, and are constantly shaped by discourse. Like any woman, the Agent Provocateur woman’s identity is fluid. She is constantly made and remade by the forces around her.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li><em>Today we’re honoured to welcome <strong>Lydia Harris</strong> of feminist DJing duo <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2013/01/23/guest-post-the-girl-germs-guide-to-starting-a-feminist-diy-club-night/" target="_blank">Girl Germs</a> and other awesomeness back to BadRep Towers. Wanna join the party? Send your pitch to <a href="mailto:badrepeditors@gmail.com"><strong>badrepeditors@gmail.com</strong></a>!</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Everybody has an opinion about Quentin Tarantino. Is he racist for using the ‘N’ word so often in his scripts? Is he a genius, or a copycat? Is he some sort of sicko, in love with violence for its own sake? Can he act? (No, he can’t.)</p>
<p>But underneath the gore, profanity, and wooden cameos, is there anything for feminists to celebrate? As unlikely as it sounds, I think there is.</p>
<p>Tarantino has written some pretty amazing parts for women. He puts them on screen, not just as eye candy or the girlfriends of the heroes, but as people with stories of their own to tell. They know how to defend themselves and their friends, and they do their own stunts. They fight (and dance) barefoot, and aren’t afraid to get their hands dirty.</p>
<p>This isn’t to say that the man himself is a feminist icon, or that his films are entirely unproblematic. Some of the violence perpetrated against the women characters has an uncomfortably voyeuristic feel to it, and every now and again his films feel more like depictions of his own sexual fantasies rather than true fiction. <a href="http://www.londonnet.co.uk/cinema/interviews/inglourious-basterds-quentin-tarantino-interview">He professes a love for ‘strong women’</a> (he grew up with a single mother), but this sexualisation of women characters does call his motives into question.</p>
<p>It’s worth bearing in mind though, that these characters haven’t sprung new and fully formed from Tarantino’s imagination &#8211; they’re loving reimaginations of the deadly but beautiful women of the B-movies and exploitation flicks Tarantino watched as a youngster. These women were usually a bit too ‘empowered’ for their own good, and often ended up getting their comeuppance. Dodgy source material, sure, but Tarantino regularly flips this trope on its head. The rapists, murderers and crooks in his movies rarely escape without feeling the wrath of their female ‘victims’.</p>
<p>Try watching Zoe Bell playing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L_FvGQsflk">‘Ship’s Mast’</a> at 100mph without feeling a heart-swelling sense of sisterly pride. And I don’t know a woman who has seen <strong>Pulp Fiction</strong> and not thought Mia Wallace would be a pretty sassy best friend (if it weren’t for the cocaine abuse).</p>
<p>As feminists, we sometimes have to dig about in the mud of misogyny to find some empowering gold dust. In honour of that, here’s a rundown of the baddest, sassiest women in QT’s weird world.</p>
<h2>Mia Wallace (Pulp Fiction)</h2>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/mia.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="13292" data-permalink="/2013/03/04/guest-post-determined-and-death-proof-the-women-of-tarantino/mia/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/mia.jpg?fit=350%2C400&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="350,400" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="mia" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/mia.jpg?fit=263%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/mia.jpg?fit=350%2C400&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-13292 alignright" alt="mia" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/mia.jpg?resize=280%2C320" width="280" height="320" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Oh, Mia Wallace. The woman who spawned a million copycat hairstyles. She doesn’t kick any ass, except in a twist contest, but she’s a seriously cool customer.</p>
<p>Did her husband Marsellus <em>really</em> throw a man over a balcony for giving her a foot-rub? Maybe not, but it’s easy to see why he might. Everybody in the movie is afraid of him, and perhaps so is Mia (she asks Vincent not to tell him about the overdose), but she seems to do pretty much what she wants anyway.</p>
<p>She flirts with Vincent over dinner, and we never find out what might have happened between them had she not mistaken his heroin for cocaine. Something of an enigma, she’s a sassy, straight-talking woman with a preference for silence over chatter (“That&#8217;s when you know you&#8217;ve found somebody special. When you can just shut the fuck up for a minute and comfortably enjoy the silence.”) This combination of beauty and brains seems to have a profound effect on the men who meet her, and enables her to survive in her world populated by crooks and murderers.</p>
<h2>Jackie Brown (Jackie Brown)</h2>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/pam_grier.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="13293" data-permalink="/2013/03/04/guest-post-determined-and-death-proof-the-women-of-tarantino/pam_grier/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/pam_grier.jpg?fit=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="300,300" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="pam_grier" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/pam_grier.jpg?fit=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/pam_grier.jpg?fit=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-13293 alignright" alt="pam_grier" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/pam_grier.jpg?resize=300%2C300" width="300" height="300" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Jackie Brown is a black woman in her forties, and the star of the movie that bears her name as its title. In the youth-obsessed, whitewashed culture of Hollywood, this is exciting and unusual in itself (depressing, huh?).</p>
<p>The legendary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pam_Grier" target="_blank">Pam Grier</a> plays a flight attendant, who works for a crappy airline. She makes some extra bucks on the side by smuggling in ill-gotten cash for a gun-dealer named Ordell, until she gets busted.</p>
<p>As she says: “Well, I&#8217;ve flown seven million miles. And I&#8217;ve been waiting on people almost 20 years. The best job I could get after my bust was Cabo Air, which is the worst job you can get in this industry. I make about sixteen thousand, with retirement benefits that ain&#8217;t worth a damn. And now with this arrest hanging over my head, I&#8217;m scared. If I lose my job I gotta start all over again, but I got nothing to start over with. I&#8217;ll be stuck with whatever I can get. And that shit is scarier than Ordell.”</p>
<p>But Jackie is a survivor in the truest sense of the word. When things look bad for her, she takes matters into her own hands, using her brains and courage to rip off the gangsters and escape a jail sentence in one outrageously brave scheme.</p>
<p>She plans everything herself, knows who she can trust, and isn’t afraid to turn a gun on a man who she knows to be a killer. She’s a smart, older, black woman who, despite being a total fox (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxy_Brown_(film)">Foxy Brown, geddit?</a>), doesn’t use her sexuality to get ahead. With media portrayal of black women usually relying heavily on sexualized stereotypes, Jackie Brown is a breath of fresh air.</p>
<h2>The Bride / Beatrix Kiddo (Kill Bill)</h2>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/beatrix2.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="13294" data-permalink="/2013/03/04/guest-post-determined-and-death-proof-the-women-of-tarantino/beatrix2/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/beatrix2.jpg?fit=400%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="400,300" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="beatrix2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/beatrix2.jpg?fit=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/beatrix2.jpg?fit=400%2C300&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-13294 alignright" alt="beatrix2" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/beatrix2.jpg?resize=320%2C240" width="320" height="240" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>When people talk about ‘empowered’ female characters in Tarantino movies, Beatrix Kiddo is who they’re usually thinking of. The woman is dragged through hell backwards, and still manages to exact bloody revenge on everybody who hurt her, or kept her from her child.</p>
<p>The trope of the vengeful woman is not a particularly progressive one. But Beatrix Kiddo is no <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bunny%20boiler">‘bunny boiler’</a>. She was shot in the head and left for dead, raped whilst in a coma, and led to believe that her unborn child had died. As much as we might find the gore and violence hard to stomach, it’s hard to argue with her motives. From Beatrix herself: “It&#8217;s mercy, compassion, and forgiveness I lack. Not rationality.”</p>
<p>She’s a woman who knows how to protect herself, and believes her life is worth fighting for. Even when she’s been buried alive, it’s still impossible to see her as a victim. And she’s not the only strong woman in the film (although she’s the only one you’re rooting for).</p>
<p>The women in <strong>Kill Bill</strong> are <em>scrappy</em>. The fights between The Bride and other female ex-members of the Deadly Viper Assasination Squad aren’t sexy ‘girl fights’. They fight with skill, knocking seven shades of shit out of each other with terrifying ferocity. They’re fighting for their lives, and it isn’t pretty.</p>
<p>But The Bride isn’t just violent and vengeful. She’s a mother who longs to be reunited with her child. Somehow, this duality doesn’t cause the dissonance you would expect. She’s a three-dimensional character, more than capable of being many different things at once. The shock of that highlights just how rare it is in a Hollywood film.</p>
<h2>Zoe Bell, Kim and Abernathy (Death Proof)</h2>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/zoeandco.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="13295" data-permalink="/2013/03/04/guest-post-determined-and-death-proof-the-women-of-tarantino/zoeandco/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/zoeandco.jpg?fit=450%2C294&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="450,294" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="zoeandco" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/zoeandco.jpg?fit=300%2C196&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/zoeandco.jpg?fit=450%2C294&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-13295 alignright" alt="zoeandco" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/zoeandco.jpg?resize=360%2C235" width="360" height="235" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><strong>Death Proof</strong> is a film of two halves, linked by one gross, murderous ex-stunt driver. In the first half, he stalks and kills a group of beautiful friends with his car. But we know that in Tarantino’s world, creeps don’t get away with things like that. When he attempts to do the same thing with another group of women, he makes a fatal error by messing with a stuntwoman, stunt driver, and their super-cool make-up artist friend.</p>
<p>I have some serious qualms about the first half, as the violence perpetrated against the victims is fetishised to an almost ludicrous degree. But things take a turn for the better when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zo%C3%AB_Bell" target="_blank">Zoe Bell</a> and her pals (played by Tracie Thorns and Rosario Dawson) arrive on screen.</p>
<p>Zoe Bell is a real-life stuntwoman, who plays herself in this movie. When you see her perched on the bonnet of a car being driven at 100 mph, that’s really her, and she’s really doing that. Which is <em>wicked</em> cool.</p>
<p>Stuntman Mike grows tired of chasing these women who refuse to be victims, but they haven’t finished with him. Instead of letting him get away, they go after him. And their intentions are clear, with Abernathy declaring “Let’s kill this bastard.”</p>
<p>In the real world, women rarely receive justice for the violence they experience. Although this vigilante-style justice is probably not what we want for our own society (however satisfying it might be), watching it on screen is incredibly cathartic. When Abernathy puts the final boot into Stuntman Mike, the urge to cheer is almost overwhelming.</p>
<h2>Shoshanna (Inglourious Basterds)</h2>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/shoshanna.png"><img data-attachment-id="13296" data-permalink="/2013/03/04/guest-post-determined-and-death-proof-the-women-of-tarantino/shoshanna/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/shoshanna.png?fit=400%2C267&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="400,267" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="shoshanna" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/shoshanna.png?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/shoshanna.png?fit=400%2C267&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-13296 alignright" alt="shoshanna" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/shoshanna.png?resize=320%2C214" width="320" height="214" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Shoshanna is the self-styled “face of Jewish vengeance” in <strong>Inglourious Basterds</strong>, Tarantino’s ‘creative’ re-imagining of World War Two. She escapes the &#8216;Jew Hunter&#8217;, who kills her whole family whilst they are in hiding. When we next see her, she’s running a cinema in occupied Paris, where the Nazis want to screen their latest propaganda film.</p>
<p>As painful as this is to her, she sees it as an opportunity to exact revenge for what was done to her family, and other Jewish families across Europe. Her single-minded resolve, and calm in the face of extraordinary pressure, is the perfect foil to the disastrous exploits of the Basterds.</p>
<p>Women in war films are usually relegated to the roles of tearful wife or showgirl. In <strong>Inglourious Basterds</strong>, it is a woman who changes the course of the war, and thus history. This epitomises one of the key attributes of Tarantino’s women: agency. They make decisions for themselves that change their lives, and the lives of others around them.</p>
<p>Of course, we know that women made a huge and valuable contribution to the war effort, in many different ways. It’s just a shame that it took a film with a fictionalised version of history to depict a woman having any sort of meaningful involvement in the conflict.</p>
<p>So, there you have it. Those are my own favourite Tarantino women. Broomhilda from <strong>Django Unchained</strong> didn’t quite make it in, as I’ve only seen it once. But I think she should get an honourable mention here, if only for <em>surviving</em>.</p>
<p>Obviously, Tarantino’s movies are far from perfect feminism-wise, and the man himself doesn’t have a great track record when it comes to saying <a href="http://www.thefword.org.uk/reviews/2007/11/is_tarantino_re_1">sexist douchebag</a> things. But with so few interesting or positive representations of women on-screen, we should celebrate the few characters who break the mould. Especially if they make us leave the cinema feeling a little cooler, a little braver and a little more willing to stand up for ourselves.</p>

It’s a hypnotic cocktail of horror and arthouse. The DVD has a campy Hammer-style cover and the tag line, ‘An erotic nightmare of vampire lust!’ Subtle. For some reason, there were a lot of lesbian vampire movies released in the 70s. However anyone looking for straight-up naughtiness will be disappointed with <strong>Daughters of Darkness</strong>. The vampires are beautiful women, but it’s not about titillation. It’s a lot weirder than that.</p>
<p>The story: a pair of newlyweds arrive at an out-of-season hotel in chilly Ostend. The bride – Valerie – is dressed all in white and appears to be the picture of naïve innocence. The groom – Stefan – has a handsome face, but there’s something not quite right about his smile. It almost looks like a sneer.</p>
<p>Their relationship appears to be a bit, well, peculiar. She’s concerned that he hasn’t told his mother about their marriage. He seems to be in no hurry to do so. Prior to their unscheduled stop-in at this beautiful but lonely place, they have both confessed that they don’t love one another and both seem okay with this. And then, during dinner, the sapphic vampire aristocrat arrives with her assistant/lover.</p>
<p>The Countess Bathory, played with otherworldly grace and just a hint of vulnerability by Delphine Seyrig, tells the couple that she is a descendant of the infamously murderous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_B%C3%A1thory" target="_blank">Hungarian countess</a>. (A real historical character and template for the ‘glamorous female vampire’ archetype, Elizabeth Bathory was supposed to have been a serial killer but apparently wasn’t really into drinking virgins&#8217; blood. That was a rumour that came about years after her death. The real Countess was never a vampire, just as Catherine the Great probably never even got to first base with any horses.)</p>
<p>Her loving description of the horrors her ancestor inflicted on young ladies gets Stefan a bit excited. Valerie is horrified. At first. And then the couple are drawn into the vampire’s world. In which the notions of victim and monster get turned sideways. And then the film briefly shows us Stefan’s ‘Mother’. (As the the none-more-seventies voiceover man enthuses in the film’s trailer, ‘She’s something else!’).</p>
<p>And there are some deaths. Including death by bowl.</p>
<p>Yes, bowl. And a lovely crystal bowl it is too. And someone knocks an entire lobster on the floor in the act. Such decadence! The film could be read as a mediation on power and relationships. (In their own ways, Countess Bathory and Stefan are both bullies.) Or an exercise in playing around with genre tropes. Or a daft-but-enjoyable confection of crazy featuring some splendid outfits (sequins, feathers, PVC capes!).</p>
<p>Actually, it’s probably a bit of all of these. It’s a strange and beautiful work. Even the bits that make you snigger might crop up in your dreams a long time after you’ve seen it.</p>
