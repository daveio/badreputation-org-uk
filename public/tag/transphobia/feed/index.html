					<description><![CDATA[What happens if you dress as a monster people can't easily gender, go to a comic con, and troll the FREE HUGS meme? Here is what happens.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re reading this, I assume you know what a comic convention is. Right? Cool. We&#8217;re on the same page.</p>
<p>You may also be aware of the FREE HUGS meme. It&#8217;s quite sweet: you hold a sign with &#8220;FREE HUGS&#8221; on it, and people can come to you to claim their free hug. Because free things are nice, hugs shouldn&#8217;t be charged for, and aaahhh and d&#8217;awww and other such sentiments. FREE HUGSing is very prevalent at comic conventions.</p>
<p>Having set that up, let me tell you a tale.</p>
<p>The scene: a large and popular comic convention held in a large and popular UK city. It&#8217;s spring, verging on summer, and it&#8217;s warm.</p>
<p>Cosplayers roam the convention with absurdly large props and wigs, and excited teenagers clutch bags of stash from their favourite webcomic artists, faces flushed with glee. Someone is dressed as a cardboard box. Someone else has a large plush Totoro. Gangs of Stormtroopers march about, videogame demos blare and cameras flash.</p>
<p>Numerous people saunter about, idly holding scraps of paper with &#8220;FREE HUGS&#8221; scrawled on them in pen, either because it&#8217;s what everyone is doing, or because they hope for a tiny scrap of human affection in this amazing sea of other people&#8217;s playtime.</p>
<p>Something terrible jingles past.</p>
<p>A long, thin, white jingling thing, with no real face and long tentacular horns. It has claws and hooves and no eyes and&#8230; a FREE HUGS sign all of its own.</p>
<div id="attachment_12554" style="width: 322px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/IMG_3557.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12554" data-attachment-id="12554" data-permalink="/2012/10/24/free-hugs-or-markgrafs-comic-convention-adventure/img_3557/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/IMG_3557-e1350399512342.jpg?fit=2304%2C3072&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="2304,3072" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;3.5&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon DIGITAL IXUS 75&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1338020814&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;8.462&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;250&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.016666666666667&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="baylonatmcm" data-image-description="&lt;p&gt;A pale-skinned person, almost fully encompassed by their costume, wearing a white monster mask which has no facial features except two long vertical slits with protruding antler-like tentacles.  The monster has a long, shimmering iridescent mane that hangs to their waist, and long, blood-soaked talons.  The costume also has several coin belts around the hips, a fur collar, and long, thigh-length white boots with a high platform and no heel, giving the impression of hooves.  The boot heels have long, backwards facing tentacles, also white, tipped with pink.  The monster is standing in a convention hall, between some comic stalls.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Do you hug it?</p>
<p>My costume monster, Babylon, is a non-gendered-but-femme creature, with no anthropomorphic secondary sex characteristics, but with performatively femme behaviour.</p>
<p>Now, as it is rare for women to &#8220;perform&#8221; their femininity, performative femininity generally tends to be the preserve of people that don&#8217;t identify as women &#8211; because &#8220;performance&#8221; indicates a degree of &#8220;artifice&#8221;, and it is unusual for someone to &#8220;put on&#8221; the presentation that&#8217;s generally considered &#8220;appropriate&#8221; for their identity.</p>
<p>(But of course, it does happen, because everything does, and identity and presentation are two different things and being a woman doesn&#8217;t make your presentation femme by default, so of course one <em>can</em> identify as female and also perform your femininity. That&#8217;s a thing that happens too. I don&#8217;t need to explain these things to you: you know about stuff, you&#8217;re all down with this. Back to telling the tale.)</p>
<p>So. Big, sparkly performance femme-ness is A Thing and a grand one at that &#8211; just, not necessarily tethered to a gender identity.  So Babylon is very hard to read. It&#8217;s too over-the-top femme to be a girl, but surely boy monsters are big and spiky, right?</p>
<p>Obviously, the answer is that Babylon is non-binary, but our average member of the public in need of a full Gender 101 isn&#8217;t going to assume that.</p>
<p>I had lots of fun wearing Babylon during the convention, mostly because it is nice to dress as a monster, but also because I discovered a few interesting things about how people interact with an ungenderable non-human costume.</p>
<ul>
<li>Teenage girls with stripy armwarmers shrieked with delight at Babylon, largely gendered it male, and happily gave it hugs.</li>
<li>Women my age wanted photographs and loved Babylon&#8217;s boots.</li>
<li>Older steampunk gentlemen gendered it female and wanted photographs.</li>
</ul>
<p>But the most hilarious demographic by far was teenage boys, and other men in costumes.</p>
<p>Teenage boys roam in knots about conventions, all holding papery requests for hugs. Their knuckles blanched as their grip on their FREE HUGS signs tightened when Babylon indicated that their desire for hugs was the same, and came over to hug them.</p>
<p>Oh, they didn&#8217;t like it. Oh, teenage boys didn&#8217;t like the Babylon. Oh no.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; they said.<br />
&#8220;Urgh,&#8221; they said.<br />
&#8220;Oh man, it&#8217;s a <em>bloke</em>, mate,&#8221; they said.</p>
<p>Babylon is not a bloke. I&#8217;m a bloke; Babylon is a Babylon. They didn&#8217;t want photographs.</p>
<div style="width: 394px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" title="babylondrawing" src="https://i2.wp.com/farm8.staticflickr.com/7041/6939472029_6d7720793b_o.jpg?resize=384%2C476" alt="A drawing of the white, tentacled monster from the costume, emerging from a hole in the ground.  It is facing left, and has its claws on the edges of the hole, pulling itself up.  Its arms are thin and muscular, and have apparen veins.  The whole image is coloured and richly textured.  The background is a dirty, earthy colour, making a sharp contrast with the pure white monster and its bloody pink and red tentacles and talons." width="384" height="476" data-recalc-dims="1" /><p class="wp-caption-text">slrrrrrrrpp</p></div>
<p>You probably see where I&#8217;m going with this. My next example is brilliant.</p>
<p>I Babyloned up to a group of Star Wars <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormtrooper_(Star_Wars)" target="_blank">Stormtroopers</a>. Now, I rather like masks and men in uniform, so I saw this as a brilliant opportunity to put the &#8220;play&#8221; into &#8220;cosplay&#8221; and be an alien at them. Which is what I did.</p>
<p>Babylon jingled everywhere and posed for photographs, and one of the chaps, reading Babylon as female, got a bit saucy with it. This is fine, and Babylon, of course, sauced right back, all jingly silver bits and long talons &#8211; and then the Stormtrooper asked us, &#8220;Getting a bit hot are we, ma&#8217;am?&#8221;</p>
<p>Babylon made a surprised gesture (it doesn&#8217;t have a mouth) and indicated that he was wrong, and it wasn&#8217;t a &#8220;ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>

He backed right off.</p>
<p>I wondered if this was the first time in his life that he had ever had anyone he had not been sexually interested in being flirtatious and forward at him.</p>
<p>I idly thought about all the times I&#8217;ve been out with lady friends of mine who&#8217;ve experienced street harassment. Random strangers making sexual advances they weren&#8217;t comfortable with. I suppressed the urge to tear off my monster mask and bellow, &#8220;HUURARRRGGH, FEMINISM, NYERRRGH&#8221; and spray liquid feminism at him from my nipples.</p>
<p>Remembering that I&#8217;ve been told that sort of behaviour &#8220;hurts the cause&#8221;, I kept my mask on and flounced off elsewhere.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the moral to this post? There isn&#8217;t one, really. It was just an amazing, beautiful, interesting and inspirational experience to be both fully androgynous and have no face.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m androgynous myself in presentation and I get gendered more-or-less randomly, but I have a <em>human face</em>, and this means I get treated differently from if I don&#8217;t. <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/06/21/slutwalk-where-are-we/" target="_blank"><strong>Some of the roughest transphobia I’ve ever had was when I was masked</strong></a>, and I don’t think that was a coincidence. Babylon doesn&#8217;t have anything like a human face: just two slits with emergent tentacles, and this simultaneously intimidates people and makes them feel more free to loudly express their opinion of it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be at the large, popular comic convention again at the end of October. If you&#8217;re going too this Hallowe&#8217;en, come and find us and give us a hug!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Remembrance can be a deeply political, even radical act. Especially if you’re remembering people that many would prefer to forget.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This weekend is Remembrance Sunday, and I’ve been umming and ahhing as usual about whether to wear a <a href="http://www.poppy.org.uk/support-us/give-money?gclid=CLjRraXHp6wCFQEd4Qodkj9F_w">red poppy</a>/a <a href="http://www.ppu.org.uk/whitepoppy/index.html">white poppy</a>/no poppy. Whatever your personal poppy choice, I think most people would agree that there’s value in the remembering.</p>
<p>The memorialising of the First World War is long established and institutionalised, to the extent that no politician will be photographed poppyless. But remembrance can also be a deeply political, even radical act. Especially if you’re remembering people that many would prefer to forget.</p>
<p>In a couple of weeks, on the 20<sup>th</sup> November, it will be the 13<sup>th</sup> International <a href="http://www.transgenderdor.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Transgender Day of Remembrance</strong></a>.  Before I started blogging at BadRep this wasn’t a big date in my calendar, but two <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/12/09/we-need-allies-a-day-in-transgender-remembrance/">moving</a> <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/12/09/we-came-here-together/">posts</a> by other team members last year made me realise that it should have been.</p>
<p>Why does it matter? As Gwendolyn Ann Smith of the Remembering Our Dead project puts it:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Transgender Day of Remembrance serves several purposes. It raises public awareness of hate crimes against transgender people, an action that current media doesn’t perform. Day of Remembrance publicly mourns and honors the lives of our brothers and sisters who might otherwise be forgotten. Through the vigil, we express love and respect for our people in the face of national indifference and hatred. Day of Remembrance reminds non-transgender people that we are their sons, daughters, parents, friends and lovers. Day of Remembrance gives our allies a chance to step forward with us and stand in vigil, memorializing those of us who’ve died by anti-transgender violence.</p></blockquote>

I’m a big gender history nerd, and although I&#8217;ve spent years reading about changing gender roles and expectations; women in history; gay, lesbian and bisexual history, there’s are gaps in my knowledge around the experiences and heritage of the transgender community.</p>
<p>So I went along to a recent talk by <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/juliet-jacques" target="_blank">Juliet Jacques</a> at <a href="http://westminster.skepticsinthepub.org/">Westminster Skeptics in the Pub</a> about transgender history from the 19<sup>th</sup> century onwards. My ignorance was laid bare. I knew about the 2004 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_Recognition_Act_2004">Gender Recognition Act</a> – I was working at the Equal Opportunities Commission helping to implement it in 2005. But I’d never heard of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compton%27s_Cafeteria_riot">Compton Caféteria Riot</a> in 1966 (there’s a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0464189/">documentary</a>) nor of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulton_and_Park">Boulton and Park</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Barry_%28surgeon%29">James Barry</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lili_Elbe">Lili Elbe</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_Hirschfeld">Magnus Hirschfield</a>. (Fun fact: most of the pictures of Nazis burning books show the bonfire that took place at the Hirschfield Institute.)</p>
<p>Jacques’s talk is available as a <a href="http://poddelusion.co.uk/blog/2011/10/03/westminster-skeptics-juliet-jacques-thinking-critically-about-transgender-issues/">podcast here</a> and here are a few other quick history resources: a brief history of trans people <a href="http://julietjacques.blogspot.com/2011/03/brief-incomplete-history-of-trans.html">in the media</a> on Jacques’ blog, a <a href="http://www.transgenderzone.com/features/timeline.htm">trans timeline</a> here, and this nifty interactive LGBT history<a href="http://www.help.northwest.nhs.uk/lgbt_timeline/timeline.html"> timeline</a> which includes a lot of dates and events significant to trans history. I also found <a title="Transexuality on film" href="http://www.glbtq.com/arts/transsexuality_film.html" target="_blank">this post</a> on film representations of transsexuality interesting.</p>
<p>Recording, recognising and remembering the histories of marginalised groups might seem like an academic endeavour, but it has a vital political function. The stories of transgender, gay and bi people, of disabled people, of women, of ethnic and religious minorities, of the poor, have been both accidentally and deliberately erased over the centuries. By remembering, we can restore these missing voices to history, and we have ammunition when we’re told that x behaviour or y social group is a modern scourge, that they’re unnatural or against tradition, or that this is the way things have always been.</p>
<p>Note: Between writing this post and publishing it I also found out about the <a title="The F Word - Intersex Day of Remembrance" href="http://www.thefword.org.uk/blog/2011/11/intersex_day_of" target="_blank"><strong>International Intersex Day of Remembrance</strong></a>, on 8 November.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Influential sci-fi author <strong>Joanna Russ</strong> died recently, aged 74. She was one of the first not only to be a major name in a male-dominated market, but to write specifically feminist SF.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m only familiar with a tiny portion of her work, but there are many memorable quotes which immediately show just where she was coming from (thanks to <strong>Ian S</strong> who sent in the third one to our Facebook page!):</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;There are plenty of images of women in science fiction. There are hardly any women.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Long before I became a feminist in any explicit way, I had turned from writing love stories about women in which women were losers, and adventure stories about men in which the men were winners, to writing adventure stories about a woman in which the woman won. It was one of the hardest things I ever did in my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In a perfect world, I would not have to be a feminist and gay activist, and I could spend my life discussing H.P. Lovecraft.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

What I didn&#8217;t know until yesterday was that Russ&#8217;s blistering short story &#8220;<A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_It_Changed"><strong>When It Changed</strong></a>&#8221; was directly inspired by Le Guin&#8217;s <strong>The Left Hand of Darkness</strong>. Le Guin tried to break down gender expectations by showing universality &#8211; in <strong>Left Hand</strong> she has a planet of genderless people. What Russ was infuriated by was that the pronoun &#8220;he&#8221; was still used in that novel by default.</p>
<p>Joanna Russ was not aiming for that universality &#8211; she was all about binary. Her message wasn&#8217;t that gender expectations shouldn&#8217;t be forced onto individuals, it was that <em>women are oppressed by men. Right now</em>. Le Guin was often much more subtle &#8211; despite many aspects of feminism (and anti-patriarchy) in her most famous books such as the <strong>Earthsea Trilogy</strong>, she wouldn&#8217;t be as specific as this until she wrote <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehanu"><strong>Tehanu</strong></a>.  In later novels such as<strong> Voices</strong> it is quite a few pages from the start of the book before the reader even discovers that the narrator is female &#8211; it is simply not important. With Russ, it was central and vital.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s tempting to look at some of the first feminist SF in the 1960s and 70s as being too enthusiastic: less considered or accurate because it had to shout twice as loud and was opening new ground. Russ did shout loudly, but she was dead right, and <em>wow</em> could she show it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard one account personally (and another on the internet) of women reading <strong>When It Changed</strong> and crying in the bookshop. It is only 8 pages long, and describes the coming of four men to a planet which suffered a plague 30 generations ago; all the male colonists have died, and women now reproduce by artificial fertilisation. They marry, work, explore, fight duels, and it doesn&#8217;t occur to anyone that men could be part of the picture. When the four newcomers greet them, their assumptions are so alien that the two groups can barely hold a conversation.</p>
<p>It won the Nebula award and was nominated for a Hugo. It is bitterly sad, and the men&#8217;s repeated assurance that &#8220;they have sexual equality on Earth, now&#8221; doesn&#8217;t even sound likely to the character saying it.</p>
<p>That female-only planet is an important part of Russ&#8217; best-known work <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Female_Man"><strong>The Female Man</strong></a>. There, it is one of four places which she uses to explore the situations women are imprisoned by and wonder what could be instead. There is a version of the real world (at the time of writing); a much poorer America where the female character&#8217;s only hope for survival is marriage; the all-female planet from her previous short story; and a world where men and women are openly fighting a cold war against each other.</p>
<p>It is a staggeringly influential book. I can remember seeing it on every library sci-fi bookshelf since I was a child. The number of authors who quote it or write about it is huge.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;C.J. Cherryh and Lois McMaster Bujold have taken their cue from Russ, writing gung-ho Realpolitik space operas that make the author of &#8216;Gor&#8217; look like the wimp he was.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8211; Thomas M. Disch, &#8216;The Dreams Our Stuff is Made Of&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;In my humble opinion Joanna Russ is simply one of the most important writers who has written in the United States in the last 50 years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8211; Samuel R. Delany
</p></blockquote>
<p>There is an entire book named <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=cegaLU7oAMwC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=oEfnQH8YZF&amp;dq=%22on%20joanna%20russ%22&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">On Joanna Russ</a>.</p>
<p>The explicitly binary approach I&#8217;ve mentioned above can read offensively now, though Russ also shared many ideas in common with third-wave feminism and was a voice in later decades too. She <a href="http://wiki.feministsf.net/index.php?title=Joanna_Russ_Interview_with_Samuel_Delany_%28WisCon_30_event%29#Buffy">praised <strong>Buffy</strong></a> when it first started, and was positive about slash fiction. But Joanna&#8217;s writing is not without its critics, especially regarding one aspect of <strong>The Female Man</strong>. There is a section (in the alternate world which has men and women  openly at war) where any men deemed less masculine than others are used degradingly as &#8216;substitute women&#8217; by the others. It is extremely offensive to trans people, and<a href="http://krackenburg.wordpress.com/2010/04/21/i-didnt-like-the-female-man-it-will-probably-take-three-posts-for-me-to-tell-you-how-much/"> there is</a> <a href="http://www.cheryl-morgan.com/?p=10581">discussion</a> <a href="http://www.cheryl-morgan.com/?page_id=4207">online</a> about how much this should count against Russ today. Her focus on a strict male/female binary was very much a product of the time, and she (quite truthfully) illustrated how men can bully those perceived as weaker, and how femininity in men is almost always linked with weakness, from the school playground onwards. (This is exactly what I was talking about in <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/12/16/big-dog/" />my post on modern alpha males</a>, and why they can&#8217;t allow themselves to <em>ever</em> be seen to be ruled by a woman, even briefly.) The issue of Russ&#8217;s writings in the 70s is more complicated than that, though, and we&#8217;re hoping to look at that decade&#8217;s approach in more detail here on BadRep at some point in the future. Russ did, at least, retract her views in later life, <a href="http://wiki.feministsf.net/index.php?title=Joanna_Russ_Interview_with_Samuel_Delany_%28WisCon_30_event%29#questions_from_the_audience.">albeit in an interview</a> given at a convention rather than in any published work. For now, it should be noted that we&#8217;re not recommending her work without reservation &#8211; there are criticisms which need to be recognised.</p>
<p>Generally though, she continued to be acclaimed as a feminist in recent years after producing non-fiction works such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Suppress_Women%27s_Writing">How To Suppress Women&#8217;s Writing</a> and also further fiction. Her sci-fi isn&#8217;t as famous with modern readers as I feel it ought to be. When I was scouring the library bookshelves as a child and teen, her name (highly ranked in Feminist SF circles) never came up as a force in mainstream SF. I think it deserves to &#8211; <strong>When It Changed</strong> hasn&#8217;t lost any of its urgency or relevance, and I&#8217;ll certainly be reading <strong>The Female Man </strong>this week. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s to a visionary and ground-breaking author who was able to brilliantly show the incredible web of assumptions and rules which not only affected women&#8217;s lives, but affected how they were allowed to write about it. Rarely has someone been able to show men&#8217;s assumptions as the intrusive, arrogant and bewildering prisons they can be.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;If you expect me to observe your taboos, I think you will have to be more precise as to exactly what they are.&#8221;<br />
&#8211; Joanna Russ</p></blockquote>
