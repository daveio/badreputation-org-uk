										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the past year, a lot of my spare time has been spent researching and writing on women in post-punk for Julia Downes&#8217; new history of the girl band, <a href="http://www.foyles.co.uk/Public/Shop/Detail.aspx?itemId=22095722"><strong>Women Make Noise</strong></a>. </p>
<p>A surprisingly difficult part of this was establishing what we talk about when we talk about post-punk. Roughly, the term refers to the wave of musical experimentation which took place in the wake of punk from the late 1970s to the mid-1980s. It was informed conceptually by the art-school background and grounding in political and cultural theory of many of its members, and distinguished by musical, vocal and lyrical experimentation and by a frequently self-conscious and self-critical approach to the idea of being in a band and making music. All of which meant that it sounded, to varying degrees, original, arresting, and odd.</p>
<p>Post-punk’s disorderly, subversive and category-resistant nature has seen it marginalised in accounts of its era, although the past few years have produced a handful of <a href="http://ripitupinfohype.blogspot.co.uk/2007/08/info-on-rip-it-up-and-start-again.html">useful retrospectives</a>, as well as the early-2000s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-punk_revival">revival</a> of post-punk musical techniques which, if you still can’t explain what it is, at least make it easier to explain what it sounds like.</p>
<p>For me, a large part of the significance of post-punk was that it seemed to involve an unprecedented amount of women as artists, fans, and critics. Its musical, political and aesthetic influence can be traced in many subsequent female-friendly movements, including twee, riot grrrl, grunge and electro. Some post-punk women – <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/03/06/rhian-jones-cover-girls-and-typical-girls/" target="_blank">the Slits</a>, <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/09/29/subtle-subversion-how-i-learned-to-love-the-raincoats-a-bit/" target="_blank">the Raincoats</a>, Lydia Lunch – have made a more enduring dent in popular consciousness than others, and some of them are more ‘hmm, interesting’ than ‘fuck yeah, hidden early-80s gem’, but all the artists featured below are worth a spin.</p>
<p>Extending the gains of punk’s emphasis on DIY culture, accessibility and amateurism, post-punk women were able to take their bands in experimental directions, producing lyrics which explored the female experience in startlingly innovative ways, and music which itself took on what Slits bassist Tessa Pollitt described, when I interviewed her for the book, as a ‘new, raw, and female’ form, a self-consciously radical sound dealing with rarely-expressed emotions like embarrassment, awkwardness and anxiety.</p>
<p>In terms of subject matter, post-punk’s ideological concern with the politicisation of the personal, and with identifying and promoting authenticity in the face of popular cultural stereotypes, lent itself to exploration from a feminine and feminist angle. This concern with authenticity was expressed in the songs themselves, which were produced, structured and presented in a way which set them apart from the glossy manufactured products of mainstream artists. It was expressed too in lyrics which demystified and deconstructed conventional femininity, love, sex and romance, and which analysed social and cultural pressures on women or the tensions of personal relationships in implicitly political ways.</p>
<p>There is far more to post-punk, and many more women within it, than I have space for here. <a href="http://musicophilia.wordpress.com/2009/01/27/women-of-post-punk-the-young-ladys-post-punk-handbook-volume-1-1978-1983/"><strong>The Young Lady’s Post-Punk Handbook</strong></a> provides a good starting-point to other women and bands in the movement, but here are ten from me to kick off:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>1. ESG</strong></p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='420' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/iaxTHyY58og?version=3&#038;rel=0&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe>
<p>ESG, from South Bronx, based their pioneering sound on a love of James Brown, Motown and disco. Spotted at a talent contest, they began to play New York’s cutting-edge clubs, where their sound dovetailed neatly, if unexpectedly, with that of the No Wave scene, and went on to share billing with PiL, Gang of Four and A Certain Ratio. </p>
<p>ESG’s blend of hip-hop and girl-group lyrical sensibility was <a href="http://www.whosampled.com/sampled/ESG/">sampled incessantly</a> by acts from Miles Davis to Tricky and Public Enemy to Liars – although the lack of royalties received antagonized the band, who addressed the issue with typical panache in the 1993 single ‘Sample Credits Don’t Pay Our Bills’.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>2. Raincoats</strong></p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='420' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/MIhrQDIQD2c?version=3&#038;rel=0&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe>
<p>The Raincoats attempted an unsweetened exploration of the social and sexual experience for women, mapping a landscape previously foreign to mainstream rock – a female-centred one of self-consciousness and self-doubt. Their debut’s self-effacing musical communalism has seen it described as the first ‘women’s rock&#8217; album.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>3. Slits</strong></p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='420' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/wrLMm5d6lqg?version=3&#038;rel=0&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe>
<p>From the art-student squats of London’s Ladbroke Grove via Germany, Spain and English suburbia, the Slits made slippery and spacious dub-punk hymns to sex and shoplifting. &#8216;Love und Romance&#8217; burlesques the banality of boy-meets-girl, &#8216;Spend, Spend, Spend’ analyses retail therapy as addiction, and &#8216;Typical Girls&#8217; castigates conventional femininity as a profit-driven invention.</p>
<p>For more on the Slits I&#8217;d recommend Zoe Street Howe&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Typical-Girls-The-Story-Slits/dp/1847727808/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1352282108&#038;sr=8-1" target="_blank"><strong>Typical Girls? The story of the Slits</strong></a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>4. Bush Tetras</strong></p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='420' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qmn-P4qbIwo?version=3&#038;rel=0&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe>
<p>There’ve been <a href="http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/40071655?uid=3738032&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21100781977701&quot;">whole essays</a> written on this song as key to life in late-70s crisis-riddled New York, but Pat Place’s stabbing guitar and Cynthia Sley’s vocal darting between grouchy imperious disdain and incipient panic are more than enough to recommend it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>5. Lydia Lunch</strong></p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='420' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ecJ9ZaRCQOk?version=3&#038;rel=0&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe>
<p>The infernal anti-Blondie, or perhaps the sub-par Patti Smith. For Lunch, the extent of her musical ability &#8216;wasn&#8217;t the point. I developed my own style, which suited the primal urgency I needed to evacuate from my system&#8217; (quoted in Simon Reynolds&#8217; <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Rip-Up-Start-Again-1978-1984/dp/057121570X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1352282203&#038;sr=1-1" target="_blank"><strong>Rip it Up and Start Again: Postpunk 1978-1984</strong></a>). </p>
<p>Lunch’s performances were, according to contemporary music writer Roy Trakin (quoted <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/No-Wave-Post-Punk-Underground-1976-1980/dp/0810995433" target="_blank">here</a>) ‘very influential in freeing people from the idea of technique as being somehow prerequisite to talent’.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>6. LiLiPUT</strong></p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='420' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ocBJt6Xz0iI?version=3&#038;rel=0&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe>
<p>Surrealistic in their Swiss-German and English lyrics, rudimentary in their technique, and the subject of a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXk0LIpa2i4" target="_blank">40-seconds-long Yummy Fur song</a> (<em>Why don’t you listen to Liliput / Where punk rock starts and ends?</em>), but great for all that.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>7. The Bloods</strong></p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='420' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xnhqi0PqDG4?version=3&#038;rel=0&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe>
<p>New York&#8217;s finest queer anarcha-feminists. &#8216;Button Up&#8217;, their only single, is absurdly ahead of its time kink-funk.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>8. Mo-dettes</strong></p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='420' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/-V7PomVtlz4?version=3&#038;rel=0&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe>
<p>Sharp-tongued and stylish Anglo-Swiss outfit. Had a complicated relationship with the partisan feminism of some of their contemporaries, but their arch, insouciant music was less ambivalent. ‘White Mice’ giddily champions female sexual agency, ‘Two Can Play’ dramatises relationships as struggles for autonomy and control, and ‘Foolish Girl’ catalogues the misadventures of a girl who renounces feminism for an unhappy marital ending.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>9. Au Pairs</strong></p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='420' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/fyMEs2ltssA?version=3&#038;rel=0&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe>
<p>At the intersection of left, feminist, queer and antiracist politics, Birmingham boys and girls the Au Pairs made radical, slyly danceable music. A good introduction to them from the Kitchen Tapes’ Rupinder Parhar <a href="http://www.newleftproject.org/index.php/site/blog_comments/rebel_music_8_the_au_pairs">can be found here</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>10. Linder Sterling</strong></p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='420' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/rvryKnzZtZE?version=3&#038;rel=0&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe>
<p>Muse to Buzzcocks and Morrissey, a visual and performance artist whose work critiqued cultural expectations of women and the commodification of the female body, an unequivocally militant feminist and occasionally a musician with the band Ludus. Ten post-punk points if your response in 2010 to Lady Gaga’s meat dress was to sniffily point out that <a href="http://032c.com/2006/fuck-morrissey-here%E2%80%99s-linder/">Linder did it better</a> at the Hacienda nearly thirty years ago.</p>
<p>For more on the background, careers, music and politics of these and other girl groups, and a look at the history of women in music from Ma Rainey to Pussy Riot &#8211; please consider <a href="http://www.foyles.co.uk/Public/Shop/Detail.aspx?itemId=22095722">buying the book</a>!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[From the past few months of coverage and debate, here are just a few things which have interested me on the complexities of Pussy Riot’s background and media presentation.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since we first wrote on Pussy Riot <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/02/06/revolting-women-slight-return-russias-pussy-riot/">back in February</a>, widespread attention has been given to the subsequent arrest, trial and imprisonment of three members of the group, while <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/15/us-russia-protest-idUSBRE88E06R20120915">mass anti-government protest continues in Russia</a>. From the past few months of coverage and debate, here are just a few things which have interested me on the complexities of Pussy Riot’s background and media presentation.</p>
<p>This (mildly NSFW) video is кисья ересь (Heresy of Little Cats), by the Russian electro-punk band Barto:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/oyMMqUzRa1A?rel=0" frameborder="0" width="420" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>As a non-speaker of Russian who hasn’t found the lyrics anywhere, I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a lot I’m not getting, but I like the song, the band are <a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/arts_n_ideas/article/electro-punk-barto-is-a-band-with-an-ideology/425794.html">pretty admirable</a>, and I like the video’s satirical emphasis on the patriarchal intertwining of political and religious authorities – the formal alliance of Putin’s government and the Russian Orthodox Church, making it possible for civil disobedience to be framed as blasphemy, was a point of contention highlighted by the Pussy Riot trial.</p>
<p>I found the song via <a href="http://myplacefp7.wordpress.com/2012/08/17/get-on-the-way-pussy-riot/">this post</a>, which discusses the relatively muted response by the Russian underground music scene to the group’s trial and imprisonment. It also corrects the impression of Pussy Riot as (merely?) a feminist punk band, when they are more a product of the intersection between political activism and performance art:</p>
<blockquote><p>As a matter of fact Pussy Riot, although calling themselves a punk-band and using the sign of punk in their performances, never belonged to the Russian punk scene. They consider themselves as art-actionists, clearly place themselves in the context of contemporary Russian actionism, quoting the names of Prigov, Brener, Kulik and other art-provocateurs of the 1990s.</p></blockquote>
<p>So Pussy Riot’s frequently mentioned connection with riot grrrl has more to do with the latter’s existence as a DIY subculture involving zines, art, détournement and activism, than with music alone. Which is fair enough; back in the 90s, one of the odder of Courtney Love’s swipes at Kathleen Hanna, in fact, was that “She&#8217;s not really in a band&#8230; She&#8217;s a political activist who took a bunch of women&#8217;s studies classes.&#8221; On the subject of Pussy Riot, Hanna herself had <a title="Kathleen Hanna" href="http://www.kathleenhanna.com/seriously-they-are-in-a-fucking-cage/" target="_blank">this</a> to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>What if people all over the world started their own performance groups, bands, art collectives, etc… and called them things like Pussy Riot Olympia. Pussy Riot, Athens Greece, Pussy Riot Paris, etc….And maybe if this trial turns out as the prosecutors want it to, with the women getting at least 3 years, we all play benefits and go to Russia en masse under the banner that we are all Pussy Riot, Yoko Ono could be in Pussy Riot, Patti Smith could be wearing a mask next to a troupe of girls from Tennesee storming the Cathedral of Christ the Savior screaming “We are all Pussy Riot!!!”</p></blockquote>
<p>As I wrote in February, it makes sense to consider Pussy Riot in the context of the former Soviet Union’s <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/adamcurtis/2012/01/the_years_of_stagnation_and_th.html">long and fascinating history</a> of political protest coalescing around<em> avant garde</em> art and music, especially punk. The Western media, perhaps understandably, tended instead to present the band in more straightforward and simplistic terms – rendering them more comprehensible to a Western audience, sure, but often in a less than helpful manner. I’d been hoping someone would pick up on the patronising and infantilising aspects of much of the media presentation of Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, Maria Alyokhina and Yekaterina Samutsevich, and, in <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/08/manic-pixie-dream-dissidents-how-the-world-misunderstands-pussy-riot/261309/">this article</a>, Sarah Kendzior nails it:</p>
<blockquote><p>Imagine this: The three men sit in court, awaiting their verdict. The youngest, a experienced dissident described by the media as a “sultry sex symbol” with “Angelina Jolie lips”, glances at his colleague, an activist praised by the Associated Press for his “pre-Raphaelite looks”. Between them sits a third man, whose lack of glamour has led the New Republic to label him “the brain” and deem his hair a “poof of dirty blonde frizz”. The dissidents – or “boys” as they are called in headlines around the world – have been the subject of numerous fashion and style profiles ever since they first spoke out against the Russian government. “He’s a flash of moving color,” the New York Times writes approvingly about their protests, “never an individual boy.” If this sounds ridiculous, it should – and not only because I changed the gender… Pussy Riot identifies as feminist, but you would never know it from the Western media, who celebrate the group with the same language that the Russian regime uses to marginalize them. The three members of Pussy Riot are “girls”, despite the fact that all of them are in their twenties and two of them are mothers. They are “punkettes”, diminutive variations on a 1990s indie-rock prototype that has little resemblance to Pussy Riot’s own trajectory as independent artists and activists.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, as Kendzior also points out, Pussy Riot have far more pressing concerns than being mischaracterized in the press. But:</p>
<blockquote><p>Pussy Riot also tells us a lot about how we see non-Western political dissent in the new media age, and could suggest a habit of mischaracterizing their grave mission in terms that feel more familiar but ultimately sell the dissidents short: youthful rebellion, rock and roll, damsels in distress.</p></blockquote>
<p>A lot of this sentiment is familiar: an impulse to treat protest in which women, particularly young women, are prominent, as fun, flippant, and fundamentally unserious. It’s the reverse of the censorious and sensationalist ‘Rage of the Girl Rioters’ response to the 2010 UK student protests. In the case of Pussy Riot, arguments for their sympathetic treatment are often explicitly predicated on the power imbalance involved – they are ‘just’ ordinary women (or indeed ‘girls’), what threat to the state can they possibly pose? – which surely entrenches the idea of women as both relatively powerless and harmless, rather than enabling any sort of feminist empowerment. Away from such frustrating portayals, however, there’s something to be said for the earlier stages of Pussy Riot’s trajectory, which offer examples both of how music can form part of a wider oppositional movement and for how women’s protest can be collective and anonymous, with no need of iconic or martyred figureheads.</p>
<p>And yes, I do realise this post can be summarised as: &#8220;Pussy Riot? Preferred their earlier work, before they got so commercial&#8221;. So it goes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There were several predictable bones to pick with last week’s <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/feb/26/nme-60-editors-favourite-covers"><strong>Guardian</strong> piece</a> in which former editors of the <strong>New Musical Express</strong> selected their most noteworthy covers. The feature left out a lot of the former <strong>Accordion Weekly</strong>’s history, notably anything prior to the late 1970s, but what struck me most about the covers chosen was the disparity between the first one and the last. The <strong>NME</strong>&#8216;s <a href="http://velvetcoalmine.wordpress.com/2009/04/17/sleeping-with-the-nme-how-the-british-music-press-picked-up-a-dose-of-the-crap/">decline</a> from a vital and thoughtful read to a list-heavy vehicle for mutual backscratching seemed to be reflected in the journey from Pennie Smith&#8217;s 1979 cover shot of the Slits, then a relatively obscure and resolutely uncommercial dub-punk girl-gang, dressed in mud and loincloths, to, thirty years on, a cover featuring the monarch of manufactured mediocrity <a href="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/2/24/1330114355043/NME-covers---Simon-Cowell-002.jpg">in a headshot</a> which, to quote a commenter, makes the paper look like the <strong>Radio Times</strong>.</p>
<p>Smith’s photographs of the Slits mudlarking in the grounds of their Surrey recording studio became a defining image of the band, notably through being used on the cover of their debut album <strong>Cut</strong>. This article looks briefly at the controversy generated by the images themselves, and how it relates to subsequent and current presentation of women in the UK music press.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/NME-covers-The-Slits-001.jpg?resize=460%2C654" alt="Image copyright Pennie Smith/the NME, shared under Fair Use guidelines. A black and white image showing The Slits swinging from trees smeared with mud." width="460" height="654" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h3>Under the Cover</h3>
<p>The space provided by punk for female as well as well as male self-expression and emancipation can be overstated – see Helen Reddington’s <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=l5l4PiOfYTcC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=helen%20reddington%20lost%20women%20rock&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=helen%20reddington%20lost%20women%20rock&amp;f=false">research</a> on the persistence of entrenched chauvinist and sexist attitudes – but the Slits were unarguably, in the words of Caroline Coon, ‘driving a coach and various guitars straight through&#8230; the concept of The Family and female domesticity’. One of the first prominent bands to spring from the art-squats of punk west London, the Slits’ early music and performance was a squall of untrained, instinctive energy, and their casually confrontational appearance and behavior drew negative reactions ranging from media disapproval to violent hostility. Although tending to recoil from any overtly political espousal of feminism, the band bluntly advocated female independence and empowerment, encouraging girls to form bands and to define themselves by their actions rather than their relationships.</p>
<blockquote><p>‘We’re just not interested in questions about Women’s Liberation&#8230; You either think chauvinism’s shit or you don’t. We think it’s shit&#8230; Girls shouldn’t hang around with people who give them aggro about what they want to do. If they do they’re idiots.’<br />
&#8211; <strong><a href="http://www.punk77.co.uk/graphics/slits/carolinecoonpage4.jpg">Slits guitarist Viv Albertine, June 1977</a></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The image on the <strong>Cut</strong> cover fits into the Slits’ more general disruptions and subversions of accepted feminine tropes, including their punk-inspired adoption of fetish and bondage gear as deconstructed parts of an everyday wardrobe, and their plain-speaking on sex and sexuality. The band’s proto-Goth contemporary Siouxsie Sioux remarked that they &#8216;weren&#8217;t glamorous, they were very earthy&#8217;. The Slits’ aesthetic and behaviour onstage and off was repeatedly referenced in terms of wildness and ferocity, reinforcing their performance of an exoticised, &#8216;untamed&#8217; sexuality, which on the album cover clashed with the band’s bucolic backdrop to create an arresting mash-up of English Rose and Amazon.</p>
<h3>Covered in Controversy</h3>
<p>Having in their earlier career declined several offers from labels intent on exploiting the novelty aspect of a girl band, and battled with industry men who expected female musicians to ‘kowtow or flutter your eyelids’, the band’s stated aim for the cover of their debut was to &#8216;show that women could be sexy without dressing in a prescribed way. Sexy, in a natural way, and naked, without being pornographic&#8217;. Their bassist Tessa Pollitt described the cover as ‘one of the most liberating things I have done’, claiming that the band were ‘celebrating the freedoms we were creating’. The cover divided opinion at the time of its release, dismissed by some as a cynically sexualized ploy, and ridiculed by others because of the group’s deviation from a conventionally desirable body shape (Smith’s photographs were taken at a point when the Slits had succumbed to the regular eating and sleeping hours of studio life, away from the chaotic amphetamine-fuelled living to which they’d grown accustomed, leaving them looking softer and more rounded than expected by those policing punk angularity &#8211; a particularly frustrating slant of attack given punk’s early attempts to transcend these kind of prescriptive aesthetics).</p>
<p>Music writer Vivien Goldman embraced the <strong>Cut</strong> cover as a defiant reclamation of the female body, and Pauline Black, who went on to form 2-Tone band the Selecter, saw it as ‘so joyous, innocent and natural that it just seemed like a celebration of womanhood rather than any cheap titillation’. It still has the power to spark disagreement: Roni Sarig in <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29050.The_Secret_History_of_Rock"><strong>The Secret History Of Rock</strong></a> waxes lyrical that the cover ‘confounded notions of sexuality and civility and positioned the group as modern primitive feminist rebels &#8211; girls not afraid to be natural, sexual and formidable’, while the author of the <a href="http://www.punk77.co.uk/groups/slitsdiscography.htm">Punk77</a> website makes the counter-claim that the image in fact undermines Sarig’s idea ‘that they were one of the first all female bands to avoid being &#8216;marketed as sex objects&#8217;&#8230; They had their tits out. For instance I was 16 when this album came out&#8230; I and many others didn&#8217;t see it as anything but three nudes on a cover!’</p>
<h3>Bad Cover Versions</h3>
<p>As for the women-in-the-music-press discussion, so far so same-old. Cazz Blase&#8217;s <a href="http://www.thefword.org.uk/features/2012/02/women_and_the_music_press">recent article</a> on the UK music press maintained that it is marketed, sold and created primarily by and for men. The <strong>NME</strong>, which in 2009 appointed Krissi Murison as its first female editor, is actually not too bad as far as the balance of genders among its staff goes &#8211; although the relative positions women occupy, and how this translates to coverage and presentation of female musicians, are different debates. In 2010, Aoife Barry gave <a href="http://www.theantiroom.com/2010/11/16/what-the-boys-said-gender-imbalance-in-music-magazines/">an overview</a> of the underrepresentation of female musicians on the covers of music magazines, emphasizing the egregiousness of Q in particular:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why not count how many women you can see on the covers of <strong>Q</strong> magazine this year (two solo covers: Cheryl Cole and Lady Gaga – and two group shots: Amy Winehouse and Lily Allen together in a group shot; and Lady Gaga again in a group shot). The reason I mention <strong>Q</strong> is that the response to ‘there aren’t enough women on the covers of music magazines’ is often ‘but that’s because it reflects the amount of women working in music&#8217;. This is not true – particularly in the case of <strong>Q</strong>, which covers mainstream rock, indie and pop music. In fact, the female musicians it covers are usually from the pop arena. And you cannot argue that the pop realm is oestrogen-free.</p></blockquote>
<p>While, as Barry admits, ‘there may not be a great conspiracy to keep women off the covers of music magazines and give them minimal coverage on the inside pages’, it is frequently the case that when women are featured, so is a latent or overt sexualizing of them which does not affect their male counterparts to the same degree.</p>
<p>One has to factor in, of course, the degree to which coverage of bands will depend upon commercial trends in rock and indie; the musical greywash which occurred under late Britpop saw a sidelining of female artists which appeared to reach its dull conclusion in the post-Libertines profusion of almost invariably male ‘landfill indie’ groups. This connection is made explicit in <strong>Q</strong>’s concern with catering for a target demographic supposedly ‘inspired by the rock&#8217;n&#8217;roll swagger of Liam, Noel, Blur and the whole Britpop scene’, a remit which perhaps explains last October’s <a href="http://covers.q4music.com/Item.aspx?pageNo=6179&amp;year=2011">gobsmackingly retrograde</a> Kasabian cover while doing little to excuse it.</p>
<h3>Covering Up?</h3>
<p>Smith’s shot of the Slits in all their unphotoshopped glory differs from <strong>Q</strong>&#8216;s cover in several obvious respects – its subjects muddy rather than glossy, wearing unselfconscious grins rather than careful high-maintenance pouts, and, crucially, having shaped the image via their own concept and direction rather than following a top-down marketing or editorial strategy. It’s true that the NME has never been an impregnable bastion of women&#8217;s liberation – even on that Slits cover, there’s the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_Three">dubious </a>strapline referring to them as the paper’s ‘Page One girls’ – and I&#8217;m sure that just as many readers saw the cover as wank material as chin-strokingly believed it to be &#8216;confounding notions of sexuality and civility&#8217;. A happy few may even have done both. But the upfront disheveled self-confidence the Slits display is still striking and even looks quaint in an era where the last comparable Empowered and Liberated woman on an <strong>NME</strong> cover was, who, Beth Ditto? Whose appearance, and the ensuing <a href="http://www.bigfatblog.com/beth-ditto-cover-nme">debates</a> on whether it constituted &#8217;empowerment&#8217; or &#8216;objectification&#8217;, proved that non-standard naked women were still controversial in 2007.</p>
<p>Cazz Blaze, citing the music press’ recession-induced drift towards conservatism, characterized by an increasing reliance on sponsorship and advertising, predicts little room for improvement in opportunities for women to express their emancipation rather than their objectification. Her characterization of online music publications like <a href="http://thequietus.com/">The Quietus</a> as more conscientious about women as artists, readers, and writers, is an interesting point. It ties in with the idea of the internet as a space where female engagement with music can be expressed and explored without being dismissed as exclusively sex-centred or derided as juvenile inanity, and where female musicians themselves can harness the internet’s capacity for unregulated self-expression and audience interaction, <a href="http://wearsthetrousers.com/2008/11/outraged-amanda-palmer-fans-mount-rebellyon/">frequently</a> in ways which circumvent or combat industry and media-led imperatives on how women are meant to appear.</p>
<p>Despite the internet’s progressive potential for allowing female artists control over their own presentation, the reception of and reaction to that presentation remains beyond their control. After punk, and after riot grrl, the jury is still out on the political uses of the naked female form, and on their degree of effectiveness. Do images like those of Ditto and the Slits deconstruct and demystify the female body? How constructively do they inform debates on body image and female sexuality? In the eyes of observers male and female, are they validating alternative ways of being attractive, or are they merely putting forward an alternative cut of meat?</p>
<p>And, of course, should we be concerned at all with how a musician looks as opposed to how she &#8211; or he &#8211; sounds?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>They decline to reveal the smallest details, aiming to maintain total secrecy. They will say only that most of the band members met at the small protests held by Russia’s once-feeble opposition, from monthly illegal demonstrations calling for the right to assembly to banned gay pride marches.

&#8211; <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/feb/02/pussy-riot-protest-russia"><strong>Guardian</strong>, 2nd February 2012</a></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://pussy-riot.livejournal.com/profile"><strong>Pussy Riot</strong></a>, like the Sex Pistols, have a name designed to make headlines, and a bit more political substance to back up the sensationalism. Formed in Moscow last September, this offshoot of Russia’s complex and fractured political scene has come to prominence in the UK media in the context of <a href="http://www.channel4.com/news/undemocratic-putin-sparks-russias-opposition">protests</a> against political corruption which have been gaining in volume and intensity after parliamentary elections last December. In mid-January, one of the collective’s impromptu guerrilla gigs, taking place on Red Square opposite the Kremlin, ended with its members <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/9028106/Russian-all-girl-punk-band-Pussy-Riot-arrested-for-performing-Vladimir-Putin-song.html">detained by police</a>.</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/qEiB1RYuYXw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/feb/03/pussy-riot-kremlin-protest-riot-grrrl">Laura Barton in the <strong>Guardian</strong></a>, picking up on the band’s citing of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bikini_Kill">Bikini Kill</a> as an inspiration, offers a slightly short-sighted view of 90s Riot Grrrl as an antecedent for the expression of &#8216;an alternative female voice&#8217;. While the group clearly do reference Riot Grrrl’s &#8216;tone of wild irreverence&#8217;, it also makes sense to consider Pussy Riot in the context of the former Soviet Union&#8217;s long and fascinating history of political protest coalescing around <em>avant garde</em> art and music, especially punk. Adam Curtis&#8217; <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/adamcurtis/2012/01/the_years_of_stagnation_and_th.html">recent blog</a> is an interesting attempt to make sense of this sort of determinedly oppositional culture which has been notable by its <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/nov/10/protest-music-akala-grace-petrie">relative absence</a> from the UK&#8217;s current wave of socio-political protest. Similarly, the clash of sartorial signifiers which Pussy Riot provide by combining miniskirts and stockings with ski-masks and balaclavas could be a legacy of Riot Grrl too, but as a practical measure it has as much in common with other Anonymous-style contemporary protest movements, not to mention the general history of <a href="http://theoccupiedtimes.co.uk/?p=2259">masking and disguise in protest</a>.</p>
<p>Russia does have a long tradition of women in protest, notably the <a href="http://www.oocities.org/mushkah/WomenRevolution.html">1917 revolution </a>in which women played a prominent part, encouraged by the <a href="http://writerinterviews.blogspot.com/2008/06/ana-siljak.html">intersection </a> of socialism with many of the goals of women’s liberation. Pussy Riot cite this ‘deep tradition&#8230; of gender and revolution – we&#8217;ve had amazing women revolutionaries.’ They add that ‘the revolution should be done by women&#8230; For now, they don&#8217;t beat or jail us as much’. This assertion ties in with <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-sUOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA144&amp;lpg=PA144&amp;dq=women+protesters+history+impunity&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gfiH9oiQKN&amp;sig=RQ5cWgISBTk4MMmPz-6sYc8joT8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=54EuT7eMAuit0QX_lLGtCA&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=women%20protesters%20history%20impunity&amp;f=false">historical debates</a> on the ability of women to take part in protest or civil disobedience with a greater degree of impunity than men &#8211; an ideal which <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-16267436">isn&#8217;t always borne out</a> by the treatment of female protesters.</p>
<p>Contemporary Russian politics &#8211; like any &#8211; are <a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v34/n01/stephen-holmes/fragments-of-a-defunct-state">not a straightforward matter</a>, and the extent of Pussy Riot&#8217;s relevance and representativeness remains to be seen. But in a context where growing and disparate opposition groups are encountering heavy and often violent repression across the world, the ways in which women participate in protest, and the styles of self-expression they employ, are always worth noting.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[It’s taken me a long time but I’m happy to admit that The Raincoats are, very gently, punk as fuck.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>So, I&#8217;m supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can&#8217;t play their instruments, right?</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>10 Things I Hate About You</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>As a twelve-year-old in a post-industrial backwater, I discovered punk a long time after the fact, but when I did I took to it like a mohawked and safety-pinned duck to water. With the snobbery and omnicognisance of youth, however, I quickly developed a doctrinaire approach whereby if ‘punk’ songs weren’t short, sharp, and shouty, I didn’t want to know. Man, did <strong>London Calling</strong> fuck with my head, with its rackety punk take on reggae and soul and funk and lovers&#8217; rock and, god forbid, <em>jazz</em>. When I first heard <strong>London Calling</strong> I swore never to listen to a good two-thirds of it again because it clearly wasn&#8217;t Real Punk. Like all teenage girls, I was insufferable.</p>

But the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Raincoats"> <strong>Raincoats</strong></a>, a London-spawned collective built around the partnership of <strong>Gina Birch</strong> and <strong>Ana da Silva</strong>, never crossed my radar.</p>
<p>As I got deeper into exploring music in its socio-political context (told you I was an insufferable teenager), my compulsive reading of <a href="http://www.rocksbackpages.com/writer.html?WriterID=marcus">Greil Marcus</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Reynolds">Simon Reynolds</a> and the 90s music press made me aware, to a grudging extent, that it was what came after punk that really shook things up &#8211; the fragmented, untrained, scraps of mad genius that formed the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postpunk">postpunk movement</a>, in which punk’s long-term revolutionary potential really bore fruit &#8211; or so I read, suspiciously. One of the most lauded of postpunk bands were the Raincoats. So I tried, but at the age of thirteen or so I never could click with them or their kind of folk-punk-gypsy-jazz-spoken-word-world-music tapestry. What was the relationship this band allegedly bore to punk? Where were the tightly-wound two-minute blasts of guitar scree and rants about boredom, alienation, nihilism, concrete and bad sex? The Raincoats’ hesitant, eerie, self-effacing, gentle and loose-knit stylings were something I had no patience for and no sympathy with. I didn’t get it, and the suggestion that this was music which, as a female, I <em>should</em> get, I found frankly offensive. It said nothing to me about my life.</p>
<blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t really know anything about The Raincoats except that they recorded some music that has affected me so much that, whenever I hear it I&#8217;m reminded of a particular time in my life when I was (shall we say) extremely unhappy, lonely, and bored. If it weren&#8217;t for the luxury of putting on that scratchy copy of The Raincoats&#8217; first record, I would have had very few moments of peace.</p>
<p>&#8211; Kurt Cobain, 1993</p></blockquote>
<p>A couple of years later, as contemporary grunge and riot grrrl joined vintage punk in my affections, Kurt Cobain’s referencing of the Raincoats made me give them a second chance, or at least a second listen. This time around I could discern something I could identify with, something that was tangled up with the altered territory of adolescence. The burgeoning horror of growing up, the all-encompassing anxiety over my looks, my body, my clothes, was something the Raincoats now spoke to. There was an obvious prototype for riot grrrl’s anatomising of feminine neurosis and feminist analysis of the personal and political. The struggle to occupy public space with confidence rather than fear, the baffling revelation that falling in love can be more nauseating angst than fairytale bliss, the terrifying tricks that biology and psychology can play on you &#8211; it was all here, just expressed through suggestion rather than stridency.</p>
<blockquote><p>Being a woman is both feeling female, expressing female and also (for the time being at least) reacting against what a woman is told she ‘should’ be like. This contradiction creates chaos in our lives and, if we want to be real, we have to neglect what has been imposed on us, we have to create our lives in a new way. It is important to try and avoid as much as possible playing the games constantly proposed to you.</p>
<p>&#8211; Ana da Silva, vocals/guitar, The Raincoats</p></blockquote>
<p>The untried, experimental nature of a lot of postpunk music seemed particularly suited to the Raincoats’ female-centred concerns. Punk did a great deal to remove barriers of precedent and technical expertise, creating a space for musical and lyrical uncharted territory. The Raincoats had sounded so off-puttingly alien to me at first because they <em>were</em>&#8211; their tentative, unfamiliar steps towards music were a groundbreaking way of doing things.</p>
<p>Sure, women had been singers and musicians before now, but even Patti Smith remained reliant on male musicians and male-defined musical styles to back up her creative ambition. By contrast, the Raincoats’ self-titled début was described by <a href="http://viviengoldman.com/">Vivien Goldman</a> as the first ‘women’s rock’ album, its deconstruction of traditional forms pioneering an arresting and persuasive form of rock without the cock. Their song writing was fresh and original, and so was their mode of dress and performance &#8211; a refusal of showbiz glamour which saw the band perform in outfits which clashed colours and styles, deconstructed fashion and female aesthetics, and certainly weren’t put together with an appreciative male gaze in mind.</p>
<blockquote><p>It was The Raincoats I related to most. They seemed like ordinary people playing extraordinary music&#8230; They had enough confidence to be vulnerable and to be themselves without having to take on the mantle of male rock/punk rock aggression or the typical female as sex symbol avec irony or sensationalism.</p>
<p>&#8211; Kim Gordon, Sonic Youth</p></blockquote>
<p>In a sense, I’m still getting into the Raincoats &#8211; they aren’t a go-to listen for me, they feature on few of the playlists I throw together, and I rarely want to stick them on at parties. They’re not a band I often want to listen to, but occasionally they’re a band I feel I need to listen to. At any rate, they’ve inspired bands, particularly women in bands, from Sonic Youth to The Gossip, and there’s little doubt of their significance, interest and influence. If further proof were needed, their version of the Kinks’ <strong>Lola</strong> stands alongside the Slits’ recasting of <strong>Heard it Through the Grapevine</strong> as one of the best boundary-blurring covers ever. It’s taken me a long time but I’m happy to admit that The Raincoats are, very gently, punk as fuck.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Cheers, Poly. Rest in peace.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was just waving goodbye to sixteen when I discovered <strong>X-Ray Spex</strong>, and I discovered them in the least cool-cred of ways: via a covermount CD I got with <strong>Kerrang!</strong> magazine, which I bought semi-religiously at the time. </p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/spex.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="5147" data-permalink="/2011/04/26/a-little-less-day-glo-goodbye-poly-styrene/spex/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/spex.jpg?fit=250%2C252&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="250,252" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="spex" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/spex.jpg?fit=250%2C252&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/spex.jpg?fit=250%2C252&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/spex.jpg?resize=250%2C252" alt="cover photo art for Germ Free Adolescents by X-Ray Spex: a row of test tubes, each containing a band member. Band members wear day glo, bright clothing." title="spex" width="250" height="252" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5147" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/spex.jpg?w=250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/spex.jpg?w=150&amp;ssl=1 150w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>This CD was part of the <em>Kerrang! Hometaping</em> series, in which various leading lights of the hard rock scene, invariably men (do shout me if this has changed, as I have since given up on<em> K!</em>, but my optimism&#8217;s economy-size) compiled mixtapes of their favourite tracks past and present. This one, compiled by Casey Chaos of parental-guidance-sticker-collecting Cali-punk-metal outfit <strong>Amen</strong>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Various+Artists/Kerrang!+Hometaping,+Volume+2:+Refuse+Music">wasn&#8217;t a bad mix, looking at it now</a>. For the most part. </p>
<p>But it was the presence of <strong>I Am A Cliché</strong> on the tracklist that put the CD on regular rotation on my Discman.  That track stood out, sparking nicely off The Distillers and The Adverts (the sum total of female input, there) and kicking defiantly <em>against</em> the roll-your-eyes-or-lose-your-lunch misogyny of <em>Let&#8217;s Fuck </em>by the Murderdolls (at least the CD had range). And the more I listened to <strong>Poly Styrene</strong>&#8216;s life-affirming shouts, the more alert I felt to the complete shit that passed (passes!) for acceptable attitudes to gender in some of the rest of the bands on the CD, in the mag, in my music collection, in general. (For that jarringly educational juxtaposition, Casey&#8217;s at least to be thanked.)</p>
<p>From there it was a short leap to the rest of <strong>Germ Free Adolescents</strong>. Nobody forgets the first time they hear the crisp, sing-song pronouncement that opens <strong>Oh Bondage, Up Yours! </strong>: <em>Some people think little girls should be seen and not heard, but <strong>I </strong>think&#8230;</em> (when I set up this blog, I entered it as the mousefloat text description for the Music Box category on the sidebar).  Every time I hear it, I feel that emphasis on <strong>but <em>I</em> think&#8230;</strong></em> reverb through me: powerful, unabashed and instantly compelling. And funny. &#8220;Playing with words and ideas, having a laugh about everything, sending it up&#8221;, as Poly herself <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/the-return-of-punks-first-lady-1027858.html">put it</a> to the <strong>Independent</strong> in 1998 (this approach was arguably worlds away from Amen&#8217;s bloodied-up on-stage histrionics, so it&#8217;s perhaps faintly ironic she made Casey&#8217;s list of hometaped heroes, but anyway).</p>

For me, it&#8217;s the loss of a personal hero &#8211; she formed the Spex in 1978 by throwing an ad in <strong>Melody Maker</strong> with a header demanding the attention of <em>YOUNG PUNX WHO WANT TO STICK IT TOGETHER</em>.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s on record, in a recent interview with <strong>6Music</strong> <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-13193968">quoted in her BBC obituary</a>, as saying, &#8220;I know I&#8217;ll probably be remembered for <strong>Oh Bondage Up Yours!</strong>&#8230; I&#8217;d like to be remembered for something a bit more spiritual.&#8221;</p>
<p>For me, the impact of X-Ray Spex actually <em>was</em> akin to something spiritual. Poly threw into stark, uncompromising relief the lack of female voices normally in play in mainstream rock, in <strong>Kerrang!</strong>, and so on. She made me wonder, for the first time, what <em><strong>I </strong>thought</em> about that. (Clue: it ends in &#8220;up yours&#8221;.) So I think in a way, although the Spex&#8217;s one album probably will always be her most famous music, that&#8217;s okay. </p>
<p>Cheers, Poly. Here&#8217;s to you. Rest in peace. (Say hi to <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/10/21/silence-is-a-rhythm-too/"><strong>Ari Up</strong></a> for us.) The world&#8217;s a little bit less day-glo now, and much the worse for it.</p>

<p>We like it when people we think are cool come out as feminists, or even just express views broadly in line with feminist ideas. It makes  us feel cool. And if we can&#8217;t feel cool, we don&#8217;t wanna be part of the  revolution. More seriously, it&#8217;s important to celebrate that folk come  to feminism through all sorts of different routes and in their own time.</p>
<p>Whenever a person has a feminist revelation of the sort that we might think is obvious (such as the lack of good female role models in certain music genres), instead of going &#8220;well, duh?!&#8221; and getting cross, here at BR Towers we go &#8220;hey, yeah! Grab a drink and join the party.&#8221;</p>
<p>First up, <a href="http://en.academic.ru/dic.nsf/enwiki/309843">Jade Puget</a>, guitarist for chart-topping emo-punksters <a href="http://www.afireinside.net/">AFI</a> and one half  of EBM/dance project <a href="http://www.blaqkaudio.com/splash/">Blaqk Audio</a>, realises there are <a href="http://shyboyswin.blogspot.com/2010/06/i-was-reading-one-of-my.html">barely any women in  his beloved electronica</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>I was reading one of my computer/electronic music  nerd alert magazines  today and I noticed that every one of these acclaimed electronic  producers is male. I realized that the electronic music scene is almost  completely male-dominated. &#8230;. we need a lady-led revolution in the  scene, girls making ill breakbeat  hardcore, wobbly dubstep basslines, 20 minute psybient epics.</p></blockquote>
<p>Next, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayley_Williams">Hayley Williams</a>, lead singer in chart-topping emo-pop-rockers <a href="http://www.paramore.net/">Paramore</a>, declares that<a href="http://yelyahwilliams.tumblr.com/post/3515761303/after-finishing-charlie-chaplins-own-story"> she&#8217;s researching Riot Grrrl</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>After finishing “Charlie Chaplin’s Own Story”.. I’m currently reading <a href="http://www.girlstothefront.com/"> this book</a>. Mostly to satisfy my thirst for knowledge on the Riot Grrrl  Movement in the 90’s and bands such as Bikini Kill and Bratmobile. But  I’m finding more and more that I wish my 13 year old self could’ve read  it. Girls, women, ladies: check it out!</p></blockquote>
<p>Both posts may have been up a little while, but finding them at the same time brought a smile.  I love that both of these excerpts reveal the demand for women past and present in the music business, and that rather than merely noting absences they are positive calls for action, alongside ways to get involved.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>GUEST POST SHOUTOUT: Please welcome Rhian Jones of <a href="http://velvetcoalmine.wordpress.com/">Velvet Coalmine</a>.<br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">******</p>
<blockquote><p>Sexuality in Rock&#8217;n&#8217;roll is one more area weighed down heavily by its history and language. While none could or should deny the aspects of sexual interest and thrill inherent in live music, the performance space is problematically male-dominated.<br />
– Ian Penman, NME, 1979</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>I really wish that I&#8217;d been born a boy; it&#8217;s easy then ’cause you don&#8217;t have to keep trying to be one all the time.<br />
– Gaye Advert, 1977</p></blockquote>
<p>Women in bands, when under the media spotlight, often find themselves swindled out of due credit by virtue of their gender. If they’re not being accused of clinging to the coattails of their backing boys to disguise their own lack of musical ability, they’re being judged on their aesthetic appeal to the exclusion of anything more relevant. It’s disappointing to observe how ubiquitously this principle applies. Even in the midst of punk, as girls picked up guitars, bass, and drumsticks, taking the stage alongside boys as more than cooing vocalists or backing dancers, they attracted that lethal combination of critical suspicion and prurient interest.</p>
<p>I love punk partly for <a href="http://www.thefword.org.uk/features/2010/04/women_of_the_pu">the number and variety of women</a> it involved and the freedom of expression it offered them. I loved <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Ray_Spex">X-Ray Spex</a></strong> – a Somali-British teenage feminist demagogue whose vocal screech swooped like a bird of prey over twisting vistas of saxophone. I loved <strong><a href="http://johnrobb77.wordpress.com/2010/10/21/ari-up-rip/">The Slits</a></strong> and their slippery, shuddering dub-punk hymns to the tedium of sex and the joys of shoplifting. And most of all, I loved <strong>Gaye Black</strong>, bassist for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adverts"><strong>The Adverts</strong></a> and widely regarded as punk&#8217;s first female star.</p>
<p>Despite their intelligent, era-defining songs like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmX5mgO_KtQ"><strong>Bored Teenagers</strong></a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayHrl-bV1kE"><strong>The Great British Mistake</strong></a>, you have to dig through several layers of punk sediment before the Adverts come to light. They were one of the first punk bands to gain commercial success, and how much of this achievement was down to Gaye is open to depressing debate. A groundbreaking example of the Babe on Bass, her experience prefigured the problems faced by lone women in bands from Blondie to Paramore: scepticism towards their musical ability tied to a disproportionate focus on their looks.</p>
<blockquote><p>She could have the impact of five Runaways, Patti Smith&#8217;s armpit, and Blondie&#8217;s split ends on Britain&#8217;s vacant female scene.<br />
– Jane Suck, Sounds, 1977</p></blockquote>
<p>Gaye’s elevation to national sweetheart began as a generic punk fairytale. In 1976, she and her partner TV Smith made an escape in time-honoured fashion from their Devonshire coastal town to London, where they swiftly formed a band. The Adverts became a fixture at pioneering punk venue <a href="http://www.3ammagazine.com/musicarchives/2003/jan/interview_andy_czezowski.html">the Roxy</a> before being snatched up for a tour with the Damned and a contract with Stiff Records.</p>
<p>A devotee of Iggy Pop and the Stranglers’ bassist Jean-Jacques Burnel, Gaye made her musical presence a vital part of the Adverts’ brand of thuggishly intrepid punk. Their breakthrough single <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKG2rG-s29M"><strong>Gary Gilmore’s Eyes</strong></a> hinges on her instrument’s ascending throb. Most Adverts songs are played as though they’re throwing punches, TV Smith’s vocals advancing in one-two jabs while Gaye’s bass lines bob and weave. On stage, she was a static and self-contained sounding-board for Smith’s livewire showmanship.</p>

<p>But her visual presence hit equally hard: she caught your eye, you caught your breath. Her iconic look – battered black leather and a kohl-rimmed thousand-yard stare – drew on Suzie Quattro and Joan Jett’s effortless rocker fundamentalism rather than the try-hard iconoclasm of Jordan or Siouxsie. Gaye was punk’s terrifyingly blank, stark, dead-eyed minimalism made flesh, the girl nihilist next door.</p>
<p>For Greil Marcus, both Gaye and the Slits were punk’s ‘pretty people who made themselves ugly’ – although clearly not ugly enough. As the reminiscences of her admirers on tribute websites and YouTube comments testify, Gaye was punk’s first female pin-up. Her press and TV appearances stirred hearts and hormones across late-70s Britain, pulling the plug on her wish to be one of the boys.</p>
<blockquote><p>I wasn&#8217;t made to feel as conscious of the fact that I was female [at the Roxy], as I was by the rock press.<br />
– Gaye in Vacant: A Diary Of The Punk Years, Nils &amp; Ray Stevenson</p></blockquote>
<p>In a 2001 interview with the website <a href="http://www.punk77.co.uk/groups/advertsinterviewwithgayeadvert.htm">Punk77</a>, Gaye recalled that &#8220;the media would concentrate on irrelevant things like clothes or be extra critical of my playing in the same way that some men are prejudiced against women drivers&#8221;. The hackneyed trope of whether girls can play seems especially incongruous in punk, a musical movement studded with gleeful and defiant amateurism. Nevertheless, Gaye’s playing was picked on as &#8220;plodding&#8221; and her mute ‘fixed sultriness’ unfavourably compared with the vocal talent of other punk women. This latter criticism betrays, among other things, a peculiar disapproval of girls in non-singing positions, as though there were a correct set of requirements for band composition, with musical preoccupation on the part of female members an intrinsically suspicious transgression of their allotted role.</p>

<p>Dismissal of Gaye’s musical credentials went hand-in-hand with an insistence on her value as eye-candy. According to the <strong>NME</strong>, their bassist’s ‘superb squeakers’ were the best thing about the Adverts and the only conceivable cause of any mainstream notice they might attract. Stiff Records instantly latched onto Gaye’s looks as a marketing tool, giving the Adverts’ <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X57IEdkKy8">debut single</a> a cover bearing a close-up of her face &#8211; all eyes and lips, the band’s name an afterthought. This was a stunt pulled without the band’s prior knowledge, which Gaye avenged by refusing to appear in other band photographs for the single.</p>
<p>As the Adverts gained more media attention, Gaye’s image began to dominate the band’s press. Again, the novelty of her status as sole female in a role other than singer seemed to confer as much fascination as her looks. She complained of fending off photographers’ requests for her &#8220;to pose with my jacket undone&#8221; and sudden &#8220;leching&#8221; from men she’d considered her friends. After &#8216;Gary Gilmore’s Eyes&#8217; hit the Top 20 and the band appeared on <strong>Top of the Pops</strong>, the national response to Gaye was extraordinary. <em>The Sun </em>described her, bafflingly, as ‘one of the saucy girl singers who have taken over pop’, and the <strong>Daily Express</strong><em> </em>swooned that she possessed:</p>
<blockquote><p>…[the same] fragile beauty that made the world and Mick Jagger fall in love with Marianne Faithful. Gaye is beautiful, she is as dark as Marianne was fair, with black hair and Castillian white skin…</p></blockquote>
<p>This presentation of Gaye, and its explicit comparison to pliant and angelic pre-punk darling Faithfull, attempted to explain her as a continuation of the past, rather than a messy break with it. As revolutionary a moment as punk was, it operated within a reactionary framework in which its icons were objectified and misunderstood.</p>
<p>The Adverts disbanded in 1979, their split hastened by Gaye’s discomfort with, and other band members’ resentment of, the puddles of critical drool collecting at her feet. Gaye&#8217;s enduring reputation as prototypical punkette pin-up tends to overshadow what she actually did – which was, in her own words, &#8220;[try] to get a good sound and play right. I&#8217;m not one of Pan&#8217;s People.&#8221; She had the misfortune to attempt this within a context in which women on stage, regardless of their reasons for and intentions in being there, were automatically sexualised, examined and evaluated in a manner wholly absent from attitudes towards their male counterparts. Ever get the feeling you’ve been cheated?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 1994 I was 12. I was also spending most of my time in the late 70s. Surely the only punk in my small Cornish town, I&#8217;d got a short back and sides, a pair of docs and a blazer prickling with safety pins. I&#8217;d got my Pistols, Clash, Ramones, Buzzcocks, Undertones. And I wanted to tear everything to pieces. I was all set.</p>
<p>Then one day while rifling through my parents&#8217; (excellent, though I hated to admit it) record collection I pulled out a sleeve that looked like a B Movie soundtrack. There was an exploding volcano, a pterosaur and three women dressed as bedouin from hell. It was <strong><em><a title="The Commercial Zone - Return of the Giant Slits, 1981" href="http://commercialzone.blogspot.com/2008/08/slits-return-of-giant-slits-1981.html" target="_self">Return of the Giant Slits</a></em></strong>.</p>
<p>When I put the record on it was like nothing I&#8217;d heard before. It was as if <strong>The Slits</strong> had stolen their beats from the gaps in other peoples&#8217; songs. The rhythms seemed alien but I felt something click into place &#8211; next time I had the bus fare to get to Truro I found and bought the magnificent <em>Cut</em> and fell in love. Here was something truly radical, with the chaos and creative destruction that I loved in punk but with irony and humour and WOMEN.</p>
<div id="attachment_359" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Ari-Up.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-359" data-attachment-id="359" data-permalink="/2010/10/21/silence-is-a-rhythm-too/ari-up/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Ari-Up.png?fit=300%2C281&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="300,281" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Ari-Up" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Ari-Up.png?fit=300%2C281&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Ari-Up.png?fit=300%2C281&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-359  " src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Ari-Up.png?resize=300%2C281" alt="Ari Up onstage at Alexandra Palace in 1981, picture CC nicksarebi 1981 http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_Slits-24.jpg" width="300" height="281" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-359" class="wp-caption-text">Ari Up onstage at Alexandra Palace in 1981</p></div>
<p>The Slits were true musical innovators, drawing as much from reggae and dub as from the punk scene. They were funny, aggressive, embarrassing, chaotic, and sexual without trying to be sexy. From the name of the band onwards they played with gender and with ideas of what women were and were meant to be.</p>
<p>The Slits’ lead vocalist <strong>Ari Up</strong> (aka InnoDBnna Forster) died yesterday aged 48. She was only 14 when she formed The Slits with drummer Palmolive (anyone else feel kinda old? Are you even <em>allowed</em> to form a punk band after you’re 20?) and was still gigging this year. Her music means a lot to me and to many others, and the importance of The Slits for women in punk and, well, most alternative music really is difficult to convey. They cracked the mould.</p>
<p>Rest in peace, Ari.</p>
<ul>
<li>Watch The Slits play <a title="The Slits - Typical Girls" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyXGblps64M&amp;feature=player_embedded" target="_self"><strong>Typical Girls</strong></a> on the bandstand in what I think is Regent&#8217;s Park</li>
<li>Listen to the whole of<em> </em>their debut album<em> </em><strong><a title="The Slits - Cut" href="http://www.we7.com/#/album/The-Slits/Cut-Koch-Entertainment" target="_self">Cut</a></strong><strong> </strong>online for free (with ads sadly, but less annoying ones than Spotify)</li>
