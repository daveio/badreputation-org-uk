										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let  me begin with some residual New Year <em>bonhomie </em>by saying that the <strong>New  Yorker</strong>’s music critic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Ross_%28music_critic%29">Alex Ross</a> is not the problem here. It’s just that  one sometimes needs to take an inventory of the symptoms before starting  on the cause. Last month I attended a talk by Ross on the release of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/nov/28/alex-ross-listen-to-this-review" target="_blank">his latest book</a>.  The talk and the discussion which followed were was interesting enough,  but throughout the evening I couldn’t help noticing that, although  there were several women in attendance, every single raised voice in the  room was male.</p>
<p>Hardly  revelatory, I know. This time last year, I contributed to a relatively  prominent and very good music blog’s retrospective on the best songs of  the past decade. More depressing if grimly predictable than Kate Nash’s  inclusion in the best-of was the fact that, out of over forty  contributors, I was one of only two women. From the demise of  <strong><a href="http://www.planbmag.com/" target="_blank">Plan B magazine</a></strong>,  with its conscious commitment to encouraging female writers, to Anwyn  Crawford’s recent rebuke of <strong>The Wire</strong>, the current lack of female voices  in mainstream music criticism is a truth universally acknowledged.</p>

<p>As  part of Ross’s audience, I’m not saying I felt excluded or unwelcome,  nor did I find the questions less interesting, relevant or articulate  for being asked in a masculine rather than feminine register. But  something did click with me when, towards the discussion’s end, a man  towards the front reticently asked Ross: &#8220;This might sound a silly  question, but – do you like to dance?&#8221;</p>
<p>The  opening caveat there is as important as the question itself. Let’s  start with the latter, which threw into sharp relief the varying ways  one can engage with music. Let&#8217;s call the difference that of Pure versus  Applied. Where Alex Ross excels is his ability to demystify music,  separating and examining its component parts. This scholarly and almost  clinical approach can succeed brilliantly, particularly when discussing  Ross’s first love, classical music. But, as an exclusive approach, I find  it lacking, and the absence of attention to dancing helps explain why.</p>
<p>I  find it very hard to think of any song I truly love that I cannot also  dance to &#8211; whether by ‘dance’ I mean drunken mock-waltzing to <strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnijX0TH-w">(White  Man) In Hammersmith Palais</a></strong> or that routine one does to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkuOAY-S6OY"><strong>Killing in the  Name Of</strong></a><strong> </strong>which involves attempting to stab your knees with your  eyebrows. I intellectually analyse the music I love, scouring its  lyrical content and its social and cultural context for meaning to  enhance my enjoyment of it, but not necessarily to justify my enjoying it in the first place. I am equally interested simply in  experiencing its rhythm, its flow, its grind, its melody, the way it  makes me want to move as well as the mechanics of how it achieves that,  its impact on my body as well as my brain. I attach as much weight to a  physical and emotional response as to a cerebral anatomising of music.  Until that question was asked, the talk had concentrated wholly on the  latter, lacking any consideration of the former, equally useful,  dimension of how music works. So no, it wasn’t ‘a silly question’. Why  the questioner, and we, might feel that it is, perhaps approaches the  heart of the matter.</p>
<p>I’m  sceptical of the patronising and reductive idea that men and women  appreciate music in intrinsically different ways, men with a cold and technical analysis and women with an exclusively personal and emotional  response. But this scepticism is a continual struggle against the weight  of cultural conditioning and its success in bequeathing to boys and  girls approved modes of engagement<em>.</em> The male = analytical/female = emotional  dichotomy is a counterproductive product of social training, and  identifying and questioning this assumption in relation to engagement  with music is part of breaking down the barriers between genders and  combating sexism in general. Doing so is hindered, however, by the  extent to which these different approaches are accorded varying weight  in wider discourse, with prevailing attitudes in music criticism  privileging one over another. The implications of this will be explored in Part Two.</p>
