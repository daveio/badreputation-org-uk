					<description><![CDATA[Why Kinect avatars made us woo and Game falling over made us boo.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>March was a big one in the world of gaming and not just because of the titles that came out. Here in the UK there&#8217;s been other big news that I&#8217;d be somewhat remiss not to mention, so please forgive me if I veer slightly away from a simple account of what I&#8217;ve been up to. So today I&#8217;ll be talking (briefly) about <strong>Mass Effect 3</strong> and the <strong>Xbox Kinect</strong> but I&#8217;ll also wander into the murky world of the financial crisis and its impact on gamers cruising the high streets.</p>
<p>First off: the games.  Obviously there’s <strong> Mass Effect 3</strong>, but as I&#8217;ve mentioned before, there will be a full post dedicated to that shortly.  For now, though, I&#8217;ll say that it&#8217;s a great addition to anyone’s collection: well-constructed story, superb combat mechanics, good graphics and generally an absorbing and engaging universe.  The ending(s) have caused issues among some fans of the franchise, and although I shan’t say here what they were or why that is, I’ll just say that <em>I</em> had no problem with the way it ended.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Rai-xbox-av.png"><img data-attachment-id="10575" data-permalink="/2012/04/11/gamer-diary-what-ive-been-playing-march-2012/rai-xbox-av/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Rai-xbox-av.png?fit=131%2C278&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="131,278" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Wvelkala avatar (Rai)" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Rai-xbox-av.png?fit=131%2C278&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Rai-xbox-av.png?fit=131%2C278&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-10575" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Rai-xbox-av.png?resize=131%2C278" alt="an Xbox Kinect avatar - a CGI caucasian figure with reddish-blonde spiked hair, a red t-shirt and black combat pants. Image: author's own." width="131" height="278" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Better then that we talk about the <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-GB/kinect"><strong>Kinect</strong></a>.  I got one at the beginning of March and a few little games to go along with it.  <strong>Kinect Adventures</strong> is the title that comes with every single sensor (if you’re buying second-hand, be sure to check!) and it is a simple bit of fun.  You use your body to complete little challenges on the screen, collect points and progress through various ranks of adventurer.  It&#8217;s a little bit addictive when you first get the Kinect as it’s all very new and novel and amazing, but in the long run it would probably hold the attention of younger gamers or be best suited to family-centred gaming sessions.</p>
<p>I also got <strong>Kinect Sports</strong> (the first game), which proved much more popular between my partner and I.  You get the option to partake in six different events: Football (Soccer), Bowling (10-pin), Table Tennis, Track &amp; Field (which contains six events in itself), Boxing and Beach Volleyball.  Again, this is a great bit of fun and you can use it for a spot of exercise as well.  You can play against four levels of computer opponent, as well as playing against your friends (or with them) online or in the same room.  You garner points and progress towards Champion status, but really it’s all about the amusement and the potential for collective gaming.</p>
<p>There are another two Kinect games knocking about my living room, but I didn’t want to talk about them as they don’t have the rather pleasing feature I’m about to detail.  The Kinect games that use your Xbox Avatar in-game (especially in Sports) are also populated with lots of other Avatar people as your opponents or team-mates.  Now, this may not sound altogether too ground-breaking or interesting, but for me it was quite nice to see a fairly equal mix of &#8211; albeit randomly generated &#8211; Avatars of all descriptions.  In simpler terms, they aren’t all male.  Even on team sports that are traditionally &#8216;single sex&#8217; sports (like football) you have men and women of all ages charging about the pitch with you.  I thought that was a nice little nod &#8211; particularly for games that will have a lot of younger, more impressionable gamers &#8211; just to say “Hey, women exist too!”.</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/game-logo-1.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="10602" data-permalink="/2012/04/11/gamer-diary-what-ive-been-playing-march-2012/game-logo-1/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/game-logo-1.jpg?fit=289%2C249&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="289,249" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="game-logo (1)" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/game-logo-1.jpg?fit=289%2C249&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/game-logo-1.jpg?fit=289%2C249&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/game-logo-1.jpg?resize=289%2C249" alt="A purple splatter of paint on a white background with the word &#039;GAME&#039; in white on top of the purple.  The logo of the Game high street shop." title="game-logo (1)" width="289" height="249" class="alignright size-full wp-image-10602" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
Now for the depressing stuff.  The company <strong>Game</strong> <a title="Game Group enters administration - Financial Times" href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/25440a6a-7745-11e1-baf3-00144feab49a.html?ftcamp=published_links/rss/companies/feed//product#axzz1qsG1aPrv" target="_blank">went belly-up</a> in March and already my local <strong>Gamestation</strong> (part of the group) has been stripped bare and locked up tight, never to be set foot in again.  I admit I rarely bought anything from Game or Gamestation, but as the last notable games-only high street chain, it&#8217;s sad to see it fail.  As a PC gamer at heart, I felt the group had forgotten about me over the years as it focused more on console gamers &#8211; and that’s fair enough if that’s where the money is &#8211; but apparently that didn’t bring in enough revenue to save them.</p>
<p>Things were not helped when <strong>EA</strong> refused to supply the group with copies of <strong>Mass Effect 3</strong> on credit and they had to give everyone who had pre-ordered their money back.  Even a few days before they closed up shop, the Gamestation I usually wander around was begging for trade-ins of the title as not a single brand new copy was in sight.  I suspect this may have been the last straw for many customers, but the advent of the internet worked its evil glory too: after all, if you can buy a two-week-old title for £15 on <strong>Amazon</strong> when it remains £30+ in a high street store, why <em>would</em> you go that extra mile and pay more?</p>
<p>It is, nevertheless, a little saddening to see the group suffer the same fate as many other high street names.  Should they remain, in one form or another, I hope they can take a more competitive stance on the price war with the internet and stop pricing themselves out of the market. <a href="http://www.bitterwallet.com/game-where-do-consumers-stand-post-administration/55054">Game&#8217;s statement</a> has more detail on the immediate results of their entry into administration. </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/bb/Skate_2_Cover.jpg" alt="cover for EA Games' Skate 2- a simple design with the title in white font overlaid across an image of two upturned skateboards." width="143" height="179" /></p>
<h3>One final word&#8230;</h3>
<p>Coincidentally, a couple of days before Game was declared a financial black hole, my partner bought himself <strong>Skate 2</strong>.  You may remember January&#8217;s Gamer Diary, where I <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/02/13/gamer-diary-what-ive-been-playing-january-2012/">mentioned</a> watching him play <strong>Skate</strong> and lamented that there were zero lady-boarders.  Well, in the second instalment, there <em>are</em> girls flying around on boards, and you can also choose to be one.  Super!  Also, the mechanics and graphics are much improved.  It has, however, to me been dubbed ‘Skate 2 AKA “<em>Shut up, Reda!</em>”’.  Don’t worry if you don’t know who Reda is; all you need to know is he talks too much.</p>
<h3>Next Time</h3>
<p>I’ll be honest: I don&#8217;t yet know what the remainder of April will bring for me.  Never fear!  I will locate juicy content for you and in the meantime you&#8217;ll soon be able to read all about what I made of <strong>ME3</strong> at last.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[When I first burst onto the pages of BadRep, no sooner had I criticised Mass Effect's trailers when FemShep arrived. So I thought it'd only be right to address the marketing of ME3 before I tell you all about the game itself.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As is no secret, the final instalment in the <strong>Mass Effect</strong> trilogy was released on 9th March after months of buildup and anticipation.  People weren&#8217;t just excited to see what would happen &#8211; <strong>Bioware</strong> &amp;<strong> EA</strong> also caused a bit of a stir with their marketing this time around.  Here I&#8217;m going to look at trailers and the game&#8217;s packaging to see whether the good-fuss about their efforts to make a more gender-balanced campaign is well-deserved.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fem-bro-shep.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="10420" data-permalink="/2012/03/26/gamer-diary-mass-effect-3-presenting-a-fairer-image/fem-bro-shep/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fem-bro-shep.jpg?fit=450%2C206&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="450,206" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="FemShep and BroShep" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fem-bro-shep.jpg?fit=300%2C137&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fem-bro-shep.jpg?fit=450%2C206&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10420" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fem-bro-shep.jpg?resize=450%2C206" alt="Meet the Shepards" width="450" height="206" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fem-bro-shep.jpg?w=450&amp;ssl=1 450w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fem-bro-shep.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Trailers</span></h3>
<p>You may remember that when I first burst onto the pages of BadRep I was talking about <a title="[Gamer Diary] RPG Advertising: Where Did All The Women Go?" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/05/16/gamer-diary-rpg-advertising-women/" target="_blank">RPG advertising</a> and the distinct lack of women in these trailers, despite the games&#8217; built-in capability for you to play as a female protagonist.  I mentioned <strong>Mass Effect</strong> advertisements, and no sooner had I criticised them than they announced they&#8217;d make a &#8216;FemShep&#8217; trailer and let the fans vote on what she&#8217;d look like.  So I thought it&#8217;d only be right to address the marketing of <strong>ME3</strong> before I tell you all about the game <em>itself.</em></p>
<p>The<a title="Mass Effect 3 Debut Trailer" href="http://youtu.be/BnEej1RfqTs" target="_blank"> first glimpses</a> we saw of <strong>Mass Effect 3</strong> didn&#8217;t show a female Shepard; actually, they barely showed a male Shepard either (but he was still there) &#8211; we were simply teased with the knowledge that the war was coming to Earth.  Notably, the voiceover doesn&#8217;t say &#8220;if <em>he</em> doesn&#8217;t bring help&#8221; but just says &#8220;Shepard&#8221; to avoid any issue of gender.  But <em>then you see male Shepard&#8230; so, er, kinda redundant there.</em></p>
<p>When they first showed everyone <a title="Mass Effect 3 FemShep Reinstated" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pShKKOV_gA" target="_blank">FemShep</a>, to me, the trailer didn&#8217;t have the same production quality that it could have had, but they made this up with later offerings, such as those below.</p>
<p>Next we have the Take Earth Back pair of trailers; <a title="Mass Effect 3 Take Earth Back (male)" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzKbIE7IM2o" target="_blank">one male</a> and <a title="Mass Effect 3 Take Earth Back Femshep" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVz3roXf-Kc" target="_blank">one female</a>.  These two did good.  They&#8217;re the same, just with a different version of Shepard in each.  There&#8217;s no making one look cooler, or more badass, than the other, and that&#8217;s <strong>great</strong>.  The pity is, though, that TV channels didn&#8217;t really seem to pick up FemShep&#8217;s version &#8211; I only ever saw the male version being broadcast.</p>
<p>Then we get to launch day and they start pushing the <a title="Mass Effect 3 Launch Trailer" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AluTOOCVXVQ" target="_blank">&#8216;Launch Trailer&#8217;</a>, and as far as I can discover, there&#8217;s only one version: Male Shepard (or BroShep)&#8217;s version.  This might not be too bad; there&#8217;s a lot of female characters shown &#8211; Ashley, Liara, Jack, Miranda etc &#8211; and that&#8217;s more than a lot of games can say at the moment.  The thing that ruins it, though, is the <em>(totally unnecessary)</em> sex snapshot of Shepard bedding Ashley, who is the woman fighting beside you in the T.E.B. trailers I linked above.</p>
<p>Of course, it could be argued that having <em>that</em> in the trailer shows how you can romance your team-mates if you so desire and that it&#8217;s an all-inclusive RPG experience.  But it really isn&#8217;t necessary and is completely discordant with the rest of the trailer.</p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Packaging</span></h3>
<p>Here I can only talk about my box when it arrived, so there may have been people receiving differently presented games.  When my game arrived the sleeve insert (that paper thing that slips under the plastic on the box) was displaying a proud BroShep on the front and back.  I was a bit disappointed as I&#8217;ve never really thought much about Template BroShep&#8217;s appearance as part of my gaming experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/FS-Cover.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="10422" data-permalink="/2012/03/26/gamer-diary-mass-effect-3-presenting-a-fairer-image/fs-cover/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/FS-Cover.jpg?fit=641%2C427&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="641,427" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;4.5&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS 1100D&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1332355575&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;35&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;2500&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.02&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="FemShep Mass Effect 3 Packaging" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/FS-Cover.jpg?fit=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/FS-Cover.jpg?fit=641%2C427&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-10422" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/FS-Cover-300x199.jpg?resize=300%2C199" alt="" width="300" height="199" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/FS-Cover.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/FS-Cover.jpg?w=450&amp;ssl=1 450w, https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/FS-Cover.jpg?w=641&amp;ssl=1 641w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t until I had to insert Disc 2 while loading the game that I discovered FemShep hiding underneath the disc!  The cover is reversible, so you can have FemShep on the front and on the back (though the screenshot inserts are still BroShep) if you take the insert out and flip it around.  Obviously, I did this immediately so I didn&#8217;t have to look at <em>his</em> smug face anymore. The reversibility is great, but you have to realise it&#8217;s available and then you have to do it yourself.</p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline">Have they done well, then?</span></h3>
<p>I think they have, but there&#8217;s a bit of improving yet to do &#8211; not for <strong>Mass Effect</strong>, as the trilogy is now complete, but for other titles following in its footsteps.</p>
<p>The male interpretation of an either/or, binary choice, RPG protagonist is still the default in marketing, it seems.  There may well be more male gamers buying these titles, but that doesn&#8217;t mean they wouldn&#8217;t want to see all a game can offer.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really very pleased that the marketing strategy has improved &#8211; at least for this game &#8211; and I&#8217;m hoping it&#8217;ll continue to do so for other releases this year and in the future.  It is a real treat to see FemShep kicking some bottoms in that Take Earth Back trailer, and I hope we&#8217;ll see lots more awesome female protagonists to come.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>As a side note: for those of you waiting to see a review, it&#8217;s coming &#8211; I&#8217;m just being extra thorough.  And yes, I will talk about <em>that ending</em> and the ensuing furore.</p>
