					<description><![CDATA[A lil' competition for the gamers in our readerbase! ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>July has been very empty on my playing schedule.  Moving house &#8211; all those <em>boxes</em> &#8211; kinda took it out of me.  I&#8217;ve just been pottering on <a href="http://www.teamfortress.com"><strong>TF2</strong></a> and aside from that I finally finished <a href="http://www.ea.com/dead-space-2"><strong>Dead Space 2</strong></a> in one 3-hour stint.  I&#8217;m also on holiday from the end of July so, that&#8217;s put a deadline on things.  I thought to myself,<em> &#8220;What can I bring to Gamer Diary this month if I haven&#8217;t played anything?&#8221;</em> and then, while gormlessly starting at <strong>Steam</strong>, I had an idea: a competition!  So, at the end of this post there&#8217;ll be some details on how you could win one of the titles I&#8217;ve written about this year (via Steam).</p>
<p>First I&#8217;ll give you something of substance.</p>
<p>The posts I wrote last month (<a title="[Gamer Diary] From Indie Camaraderie to “Get back in the kitchen, slut!”: recent ups and downs of the internet gamingverse" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/07/05/gamer-diary-from-indie-camaraderie-to-get-back-in-the-kitchen-slut-the-ups-and-downs-of-the-internet-gaming-verse/">here</a> and <a title="[Gamer Diary] Rollercoaster June: an addendum" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/07/06/gamer-diary-rollercoaster-june-an-addendum/">here</a>) were somewhat laden with negativity &#8211; you could say legitimately &#8211; so I thought that for this offering I&#8217;d continue to talk about our gaming community and the relationship developers have with their audiences.  Most importantly, I&#8217;d like to highlight a couple of examples of those who are getting it right.  Or, at the very least &#8211; because no one can be perfect &#8211; who seem to be doing it better than others.</p>
<p>There are a lot of devs and publishers who have their plus points, and there are those that have their negatives.  Most have both, but some are more <em>memorable</em> for either one of these polar options.  For this post I&#8217;d like to look at the ones who are most famed for being a little bit awesome.</p>
<p>It being summer, those who know them will not be surprised that I&#8217;m going to bring up <strong>Valve</strong>.  During the <em>Meet the Pyro</em> update for <strong>Team Fortress 2</strong>, they announced the <strong>Source Filmmaker</strong>, and as the Summer Sale began, they announced <strong>Greenlight</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/source_filmmaker.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="11562" data-permalink="/2012/07/30/gamer-diary-what-ive-been-playing-july-2012-community-relations-and-a-competition/source_filmmaker/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/source_filmmaker.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="600,400" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Source Filmmaker" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/source_filmmaker.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/source_filmmaker.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignleft  wp-image-11562" title="Source Filmmaker" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/source_filmmaker.jpg?resize=360%2C240" alt="source filmmaker title screen - white lettering on black background with a gold film reel graphic" width="360" height="240" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/source_filmmaker.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/source_filmmaker.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>I jumped on <a title="Source Filmmaker" href="http://sourcefilmmaker.com/" target="_blank">Filmmaker</a> and have quite enjoyed playing with it.  Here&#8217;s my one-and-only even-vaguely-close-to-finished <a title="YouTube: Solider/Demo Showdown (wvelkala)" href="http://youtu.be/QN1asTKDaso" target="_blank">short I made</a>.  The tutorials started off simply enough but after a few of them, &#8216;Bay&#8217; (our guide) seems to dispense with the explaining-it-to-a-layperson format and just starts blurting jargon at you left, right and centre.  Hence why I haven&#8217;t finished the tutorial video yet. (That and the fact I got distracted with my little Western-style showdown there.)</p>
<p>One other criticism at this point is that the Store Page (on Steam) for the Filmmaker has a list of minimum system requirements, but not all of these are accurate.  The page lists that you need a minimum resolution of 1366 x 768, which I had, but this creates problems with displaying all the necessary functions of the tool.  I had to bump up to the &#8220;suggested&#8221; 1920 x 1080 in order to get full functionality out of it.  But, hey, it&#8217;s free, it&#8217;s pretty fun and is a great way to get involved in the community.</p>
<p>Now, <a title="Steam Greenlight" href="http://steamcommunity.com/greenlight/" target="_blank">Greenlight</a> is not something I expect to benefit from &#8211; as I&#8217;m not a developer &#8211; but I will definitely be checking it out from a voter&#8217;s perspective.  Here&#8217;s the basic premise: lots of games get submitted to Valve looking to be sold via Steam; they started to think maybe there was a better way of selecting games; having seen the success of the Workshop ratings system they thought of employing a similar thing for games; Greenlight allows developers to submit their games and be at the mercy of the community.  In theory, if the community likes your game(s), you get high ratings/votes, and your game gets to go to Steam and be sold through the client.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/greenligh_SOON.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="11561" data-permalink="/2012/07/30/gamer-diary-what-ive-been-playing-july-2012-community-relations-and-a-competition/greenligh_soon/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/greenligh_SOON.jpg?fit=949%2C211&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="949,211" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Steam Greenlight: Coming Soon" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/greenligh_SOON.jpg?fit=300%2C66&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/greenligh_SOON.jpg?fit=949%2C211&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-11561" title="Steam Greenlight: Coming Soon" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/greenligh_SOON.jpg?resize=531%2C118" alt="Title screen reading 'Greenlight: coming soon' in green on a black background" width="531" height="118" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/greenligh_SOON.jpg?w=949&amp;ssl=1 949w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/greenligh_SOON.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 531px) 100vw, 531px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a brilliant opportunity for a <em>lot</em> of smalltime and bedroom developers to get recognition for their work, to build a fanbase and maybe make some money out of their work.  So, Steam users of BadRep, get behind this!  When it arrives, let&#8217;s make sure we show Valve this is a good tool to help out the smalltimers.</p>
<h3>Competition Time!</h3>
<p>In celebration of a variety of things (Valve being awesome, &#8220;summer&#8221;, I&#8217;ve been at BR Towers over a year now&#8230;) I thought a little gaming giveaway would be nice.  As BR is voluntary, this is me buying prizes for you guys, so given that I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll understand why this competition happens to follow the Steam Summer Sale.</p>
<h3>Up for grabs:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Torchlight</strong> &#8211; as mentioned <a title="[Gamer Diary] What I’ve been playing… June 2012" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/07/12/gamer-diary-what-ive-been-playing-june-2012/" target="_blank">June&#8217;s &#8220;&#8230;Playing&#8221;</a> post.</li>
<li><strong>Bastion</strong> &#8211; also from June (see link above).</li>
<li><strong>LIMBO</strong> &#8211; recently part of Humble Bundle V (discussed <a title="[Gamer Diary] From Indie Camaraderie to “Get back in the kitchen, slut!”: recent ups and downs of the internet gamingverse" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/07/05/gamer-diary-from-indie-camaraderie-to-get-back-in-the-kitchen-slut-the-ups-and-downs-of-the-internet-gaming-verse/" target="_blank">here</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How to enter:</span></p>
<p>Leave a comment on this post (they do not automatically see the light of the internet so your details will only be seen by Team BadRep) and remember to include an email address linked to a Steam account or your Steam ID and which of the three games you&#8217;d prefer.</p>
<p>Early in August I&#8217;ll collect all the details, and using some funky random number generators to do some description of Name-out-of-the-Hat magic, I&#8217;ll then get in touch with winners to arrange the gifting of their new Steam game.</p>
<p>Simple as that, really.  Good luck!</p>
<p>But if you&#8217;re feeling generous, could you spare a couple of minutes <a title="SurveyMonkey: Can the consumer influence the creator?" href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/RX9V7ZY" target="_blank">to complete this little survey</a>?</p>

					<description><![CDATA[That's correct, folks!  I trundled my way down to London last Thursday to insert myself into a world of new and upcoming games, developer sessions and general geekdom.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="width: 317px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/erroia/6184862216/"><img loading="lazy" class="  " src="https://i2.wp.com/farm7.static.flickr.com/6163/6184862216_3279ca3b72_b.jpg?resize=307%2C205" alt="Picture shows two wristbands, one saying 'VIP Press', on top of two Bad Reputation business cards." width="307" height="205" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Yessir, that does say VIP!</p></div>
<p>That&#8217;s correct, folks!  I trundled my way down to London last Thursday to insert myself into a world of new and upcoming games, developer sessions and general geekdom.  What&#8217;s even better is that <a title="Eurogamer" href="http://www.eurogamer.net/" target="_blank"><strong>Eurogamer</strong></a> were kind enough to give me a press pass to do so, and now, my dear readers, you get to hear all about it!</p>
<p>First of all, this post right here is going to be a general look at the whole experience, and I&#8217;ll give you some insight into what else I have in store for you in later posts.  Simple as that, really!  Shall we get started?</p>
<p>As I had to travel down from our second city in the morning I didn&#8217;t get into the Expo until close to midday. Even so, with a little ticket with the words &#8220;Press Pass&#8221; on I still got in without issue (even if they did give me the wrong wristband).  My brother had come along for the Thursday and was already inside, so I had a task trying to locate him.  In the end I gave up and darted straight to see <a title="RAGE official website" href="http://www.rage.com/en" target="_blank"><strong>Rage</strong></a> (coincidentally, so did he) as I am a mild <a title="id Software [18+ site]" href="http://www.idsoftware.com/" target="_blank"><strong>id Software</strong></a> fanboi&#8230; don&#8217;t tell anyone!</p>
<p>After that I went to visit <a title="Special Effect" href="http://www.specialeffect.org.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>Special Effect</strong></a>&#8216;s World Record Attempt and did my practice run &#8211; you&#8217;ll be hearing more about this in a dedicated post &#8211; in which you have to complete a racing track using nought but your own eye movements.  These guys were there trying to raise awareness for gamers with disabilities who need modified controls to enjoy the world of gaming.  Very admirable, indeed.  I had a nice chat with one of them on the Friday and I will be urging you all to give them a shout however you can.</p>
<p>After a bit of milling around I headed up for my interviews with <a title="Trion Worlds [English]" href="http://www.trionworlds.com/en/" target="_blank"><strong>Trion Worlds</strong></a> on their games <a title="Rift: game website" href="http://uk.riftgame.com/en/" target="_blank"><strong>Rift</strong></a> and <a title="End of Nations: game website" href="http://www.endofnations.com/en/" target="_blank"><strong>End of Nations</strong></a>.  I had a good hour between the two and some interesting responses to questions, but you&#8217;ll have to wait for the interview posts to hear more about that.</p>
<p>Over the course of the two days I also got round to playing quite a few of the big names like <a title="Elder Scrolls website" href="http://elderscrolls.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Skyrim</strong></a>, <a title="Bioware's Mass Effect page" href="http://masseffect.bioware.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Mass Effect 3</strong></a>, <a title="Battlefied 3" href="www.battlefield.com/uk/battlefield3" target="_blank"><strong>Battlefield 3</strong></a> and <a title="Steam page for CS:GO" href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/1800/" target="_blank"><strong>CounterStrike: Global Offensive</strong></a>, as well as some of the more family-suited games like <a title="Sega's Sonic Generations page" href="http://www.sega.com/games/sonic-generations" target="_blank"><strong>Sonic Generations</strong></a> and <a title="Ratchet and Clank site" href="http://ratchetandclank.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Ratchet and Clank All 4 One</strong></a>.  You&#8217;ll get to hear what I thought of all the games I played in my round-up post, which will include a series of mini-reviews for your delectation.</p>
<p>Another excellent facet to the Expo was the Indie Arcade and the Retro section &#8211; in which there was <a title="Wolfenstein 3-D on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D" target="_blank"><strong>Wolfenstein 3D</strong></a> on no less than a <a title="Atari Jaguar on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_Jaguar" target="_blank">Jaguar</a> &#8211; where I had great fun playing with games I hadn&#8217;t seen in years on consoles and arcades that are likely part of someone&#8217;s private gaming museum.  This and EG&#8217;s Game of the Year for the past decade wall were a genuine pleasure to see.</p>
<p>Also upcoming from my experience at Eurogamer there&#8217;ll be a post on what I think about the prevalence of oversexualised women as a (meagre) excuse for marketing at these events &#8211; what does this say about how marketers view gamers? &#8211; with interested snippets from an overheard conversation between two stall workers (they weren&#8217;t being all that covert about the chat, either!).</p>
<div style="width: 217px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/erroia/6184442235/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm7.static.flickr.com/6177/6184442235_43347141de.jpg?resize=207%2C383" alt="A large banner from the Eurogamer Expo 2011 directing people to the Developer Sessions" width="207" height="383" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Onwards to meet your heroes of geekery!</p></div>
<p>Another piece I&#8217;ve been brewing for a while, but held off just in case I could corner someone from id Software after their Developer Session to ask them about it: Dystopian Beauties.  Ever noticed how almost all the women in the post-apocalyptic world are pretty stereotypically hot?  What happened to all the &#8216;<em>normal</em>&#8216; women, hmm?  Is there some sort of &#8220;<a title="Bill Bailey's 'Beautiful Ladies' de Burgh parody" href="http://youtu.be/lT8hVPUlIJ4" target="_blank">Kill the Trolls</a>&#8221; global event that occurs simultaneously with the collapse/destruction of the world?  I will be exploring the many possible explanations for this.</p>
<p>On the overall experience front it was pretty great for me as a first time Expo-goer, with a few snagging points: the demonstrable exclusion of female gamers in the marketing; the assumption (several times) that I was clearly &#8220;new to FPS genre&#8221; or &#8220;new to war games&#8221; (so tedious) on the basis of what I looked like and the assumptions stall reps made about a) my gender and b) my personality; the ridiculous prevalence of consoles on the playable games &#8211; I am a dedicated PC gamer and trying to play things with thumbsticks drives me up the wall; and, finally, the fact it cost me £6 for a sausage in a roll and a bottle of water.  Otherwise, the punters were all very friendly with each other and it was a good environment full of like-minded individuals that I really enjoyed.</p>
<p>But what&#8217;s that, you say?  A <em>competition?</em>  Why, yes!  Yes there is a competition!  I have gathered a few little goodies at the Expo to give away&#8230; but more on that later my eager chums!  For now, I will have to leave you with feverish eyes filled with the fire of excitement &#8211; to be continued, fellow travellers&#8230;</p>
