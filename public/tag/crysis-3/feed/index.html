										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Short answer?  Not a lot.  I find myself in the post-epic lull that tends to happen to me after I&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/04/18/gamer-diary-mass-effect-3/">powered through a great big game </a>all the way through &#8211; I end up just being a bit frazzled.  This has lasted longer than usual, possibly because I find myself in the odd position of having actually read a book.  That sounds much more self-condescending that it ought to: what I mean is that I am terrible at finishing books &#8211; there&#8217;s a good 10-20 half-read titles populating the shelves here.  This month however, I got through a whole one, from start to finish, but this may just have something to do with my new job (in a library).</p>
<p>Why am I babbling about books?  Because I&#8217;m trying to explain, as best I can, why I haven&#8217;t done much gaming this month.  Or, at least, not much that I can bring new content to you with.  There was some more <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/04/11/gamer-diary-what-ive-been-playing-march-2012/">Kinect</a> &#8211; my parents are better at the bowling game than I am &#8211; and some other little bits and pieces like a quick foray onto <a href="http://www.tf2.com/"><strong>Team Fortress 2</strong></a> to craft weapons and hats.</p>
<p>So, my apologies for the brevity of this post!  What I did play was <strong>Portal 2</strong>, on the &#8216;Play Day&#8217; that marked the one year anniversary of its release.  I thought it&#8217;d be a good thing to write about, so I did a Google and it turned out we (BadRep) are the <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/06/13/found-feminism-portal-2-and-saints-row-2-but-not-brink/">second result</a> when you search for &#8220;Portal 2 feminist&#8221;.</p>

There we are! Second in the results!</p></div>
<p>I also had a gander at that top link and presented my counter-argument over on my own blog <a title="The Talking Automaton: Portal 2" href="http://thetalkingautomaton.wordpress.com/2012/04/19/portal2/" target="_blank">here</a>, which some of you who follow us <a href="http://twitter.com/badrepuk">on Twitter</a> might have already seen.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t want to simply regurgitate what I&#8217;ve already written elsewhere all over BR, which is why this is such a short post, but if I may, I&#8217;ll show you what I&#8217;m excited for in the upcoming Gaming Future.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Portal 2</strong>: <a title="YouTube: Perpetual Testing Initiative" href="http://youtu.be/b7rZO2ACP3A" target="_blank">Aperture Perpetual Testing Initiative</a> &#8211; May 8th</li>
<li><strong>Diablo III</strong> &#8211; <a title="YouTube: Diablo III cinematic trailer" href="http://youtu.be/EgbUSsblCSQ" target="_blank">Finally being released</a>(!) and I&#8217;m looking forward to playing as some of those <a title="YouTube: Diablo 3 Demon Hunter Trailer" href="http://youtu.be/8scZZfU9Zh8" target="_blank">kick-ass looking fem-versions</a> <em>(apart from those stupid heels, ugh, seriously?!)</em> &#8211; May 15th (UK)</li>
<li><strong>Max Payne 3</strong> &#8211; More for the technology than the<em> (totally original &#8211; hurhur)</em> <a title="YouTube: Max Payne 3 Trailer #2" href="http://youtu.be/JTPRPr15sW0" target="_blank">damsel-in-distress</a> storyline &#8211; May 15th</li>
</ul>
<p>Later on, there&#8217;s also <a title="Borderlands 2 Launch Date Trailer" href="http://youtu.be/MCWJUSulnro" target="_blank"><strong>Borderlands 2</strong></a> which I&#8217;m looking forward to, and <a title="Crysis 3 trailer" href="http://youtu.be/g5NNkyDt65w" target="_blank"><strong>Crysis 3</strong></a> but I have to finish <strong>Crysis 2</strong> first &#8211; oops!  I&#8217;ll also endeavour to play something a bit less, er&#8230; shooty and more casual, for those of you out there who don&#8217;t really do the FPS thing.  Hopefully I&#8217;ll get some new tech over the summer to help on that front.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll also be writing up some interesting posts about humour and gender in games, and I might do some &#8216;case study&#8217; style posts on some of the prominent female characters out there.  I&#8217;ll do my best to bring you more exciting tales next month!</p>
