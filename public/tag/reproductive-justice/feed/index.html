					<description><![CDATA[What sort of dystopia is this, you ask? This is Ireland, of course, a one hour flight away. It’s where I grew up.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Reader Sinead M sent us the following short post last week. If you&#8217;re part of the <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/07/11/the-pro-choice-push-back-starts-here/">Pro-Choice</a> <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/03/02/reproductive-justice-in-the-uk-part-1/">Push</a> <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/03/03/reproductive-justice-in-the-uk-part-2/">Back</a>, we think it raises a point or two that we shouldn&#8217;t forget. Read and spread around if you can &#8211; we&#8217;ll owe you one.</em></p>
<p>As a right-thinking feminist, or an engaged human being, or a person who occasionally glances at the news, you may recently have heard about Nadine Dorries’ proposed amendment to the Health and Social Care Bill. It would have provided something deemed ‘independent counselling’ for women seeking an abortion. It may well have made you feel irritable for a while.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/asn_logo.png"><img data-attachment-id="7680" data-permalink="/2011/10/06/guest-post-a-little-begging-letter-about-reproductive-rights/asn_logo/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/asn_logo.png?fit=175%2C106&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="175,106" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="asn_logo" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/asn_logo.png?fit=175%2C106&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/asn_logo.png?fit=175%2C106&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/asn_logo.png?resize=175%2C106" alt="Logo of Abortion Support Network showing three interlinked black and grey &#039;woman&#039; symbols which also look a bit like question marks. Image copyright Abortion Support Network, used under Fair Use guidelines." title="asn_logo" width="175" height="106" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7680" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>It was an amendment so controversial it succeeded in distracting rather a lot of attention from the substantive bill, which could probably have borne a little scrutiny itself. The public reaction in the UK to the Dorries amendment was loud and it was largely scathing. A woman shouldn’t have to argue or debate with independent counsellors before availing herself of her legal rights, and any move towards such a position must be opposed.</p>
<p>The amendment was soundly defeated, and we all continued to live in a country where women are permitted to have reproductive rights without begging for them. Hurrah.</p>
<p>But imagine a world where Dorries’ amendment was passed, and then, if you’re brave, imagine a world where reproductive rights were rolled back entirely. It’s like a John Lennon song, but completely different. Now imagine living in a theocracy, or the remnants of one. Imagine finding out you were pregnant and knowing you didn’t want a child and having to accept that legally, the only thing you could do is leave your country and find one that could provide a safe and legal abortion, carried out by people who have had medical training. What sort of dystopia is this, you ask?</p>
<p>This is Ireland, of course, a one hour flight away. It’s where I grew up.</p>
<p>Abortion is illegal in Ireland. If you want one, you will need to obtain one in Britain. Simple as that.</p>
<p>It is a law, like so many, that discriminates on the basis of personal wealth and privilege. If you have options, education, confidence, access to a computer and a credit card, you can book an appointment for a private abortion in the UK and then you can book a flight. But if you don’t have these things you will struggle. Let’s be clear about this &#8211; you will require money. A return flight is the better part of one hundred pounds. An early abortion will cost about four hundred pounds. A later term abortion, all the more likely if you have struggled to access services or figure out how to book or fund an appointment without assistance or support of any kind, will cost significantly more.</p>

The resulting disruption of flights was a nuisance to many, but to those who had booked a private abortion in the UK, it was potentially disastrous. Forced to rebook their appointment and their flights, and in some cases forced to now book a later term – and therefore more expensive – abortion, many found themselves in desperate need of financial assistance. The Abortion Support Network supplies a non-judgemental ear, but more importantly, practical help: a place to stay in a foreign country, assistance with booking flights and appointments, and, crucially, money. It is hard, in a country with legal abortion and a national health service, free at point of delivery, to comprehend how important this can be.</p>
<p>I have always thought that maybe someday I will get to raise a quiet glass to Irish independence, should they choose to stop relying on Britain to supply basic medical services to Irish women. In the meantime I’ll toast the ASN. If you believe in reproductive choice and that a woman shouldn’t be<br />
forced to pick between carrying an unwanted pregnancy and a backstreet abortion, please consider supporting them.</p>

<p>Some of Team BadRep were at the pro-choice rally in Westminster on Saturday with 300+ other people including Kate Smurthwaite, Laurie Penny, Diane Abbott MP, Evan Davis MP and Jenny Jones of the Green Party to protest the attempts being made to restrict access to free, safe, legal abortion. Here&#8217;s the <strong>Guardian</strong> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jul/09/pro-choice-protesters-abortion-rights-rally" target="_blank">writeup</a> and a great <a href="http://www.demotiximages.com/news/750684/womens-rights-groups-stage-pro-choice-demonstration-westminster" target="_blank">slideshow</a> of pictures.</p>
<p>Why were we out in force raising our voice for choice? Here&#8217;s a quick rundown in case you&#8217;ve missed any of the grim news in recent months&#8230; What frightens me most at the moment is that ‘Right to Know’ campaign architects Nadine Dorries MP and Frank Fields MP (guess which party! Go on. Guess) have added amendments to the Health and Social Care Bill to change the law on pregnancy counselling. Their big idea is that abortion providers who offer counselling such as Marie Stopes and British Pregnancy Advisory Service have a ‘vested interest’ in persuading women to have a termination. Because abortion is <em>such</em> a money spinner&#8230; It&#8217;s a wonder we don&#8217;t see more people on <strong>Dragon&#8217;s Den</strong> offering an investment opportunity in a chain of pop-up abortion clinics. Anyway, here&#8217;s a <a title="EFC - Why Field and Dorries are wrong" href="http://educationforchoice.blogspot.com/2011/03/why-field-and-dorries-are-wrong.html" target="_blank">post</a> by <a href="http://www.efc.org.uk/Home" target="_blank">Education for Choice</a> explaining why this is bollocks, and <a href="http://www.abortionrights.org.uk/" target="_blank">Abortion Rights</a> give the campaign a dressing down <a href="http://www.touchstoneblog.org.uk/2011/04/nadine-dorries-abortion-amendments-sound-reasonable/">here</a>.<a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG00349-20110709-1412.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="6452" data-permalink="/2011/07/11/the-pro-choice-push-back-starts-here/img00349-20110709-1412/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG00349-20110709-1412.jpg?fit=872%2C937&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="872,937" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Politicians make crappy doctors" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG00349-20110709-1412.jpg?fit=279%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG00349-20110709-1412.jpg?fit=872%2C937&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6452" style="margin: 10px" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG00349-20110709-1412-279x300.jpg?resize=279%2C300" alt="Placard reading 'politicians make crappy doctors!'" width="279" height="300" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG00349-20110709-1412.jpg?w=279&amp;ssl=1 279w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG00349-20110709-1412.jpg?w=872&amp;ssl=1 872w" sizes="(max-width: 279px) 100vw, 279px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Anti-choicers LIFE were invited to sit on the government&#8217;s <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2011/may/24/abortion-sexual-health-coalition" target="_blank">Sexual Health Forum</a> at the same time that <a href="http://www.bpas.org/bpaswoman">BPAS</a> got kicked off.  A new <a href="http://www.lifecharity.org.uk/srecouncillaunchmay2011" target="_blank">Sex and Relationships Education Council</a> of abstinence and anti-choice organisations drew praise from Secretary of State for Education / evil ventriloquist&#8217;s puppet Michael Gove. Nadine Dorries popped up again with a bill proposing <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/may/05/nadine-dorries-abstinence-bill-girls-sex" target="_blank">abstinence education for girls</a> which passed the first stage vote in parliament. Does abstinence education work? Short answer: no. Long answer: <a href="http://educationforchoice.blogspot.com/2011/05/myth-busting-monday-abstinence.html" target="_blank">no</a>. Then of course there&#8217;s the shocking situation facing women in Ireland (find out more from <a href="http://www.abortionsupport.org.uk/" target="_blank">Abortion Support Network</a>)</p>
<p>It was great to see so many angry people out on Saturday, and hear the inspiring speeches. Lisa Hallgarten of Education for Choice read out a chilling message from pro-choice activists in the US warning us not to be complacent because things are getting really bad across the Atlantic (see <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jun/24/america-pregnant-women-murder-charges" target="_blank">this</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/01/us/01kansas.html" target="_blank">this</a>, for example) and it all started in the same way it has here: with little laws which chip away at the right to choose.</p>
<p>I was particularly happy that the demo drew support from <a href="http://queerresistance.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Queer Resistance</a>, who made the vital point that we must work together cross-cause to protect bodily autonomy, reproductive rights and sexual freedom. This demo felt closer in spirit to the <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/03/03/reproductive-justice-in-the-uk-part-2/" target="_blank">reproductive justice</a> movement I believe we need to build to fight proposals which are spun as pro-woman but are in fact bad news for anyone who doesn&#8217;t subscribe to a vicious and controlling version of &#8220;family values&#8221;.</p>
<p>This demonstration is just the beginning of a grassroots push back against Dorries, Field, Gove and their supporters, and we&#8217;re going to need your help. Start by <a href="http://www.abortionrights.org.uk/content/view/397/110/" target="_blank">emailing your MP</a> about the abortion amendments and keeping track of developments on Education For Choice&#8217;s <a href="http://www.educationforchoice.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">blog</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/03/02/reproductive-justice-in-the-uk-part-1"><em>Read Part 1 of this article here</em></a></strong></p>
<p>I asked some leading UK pro-choice campaigners whether the US reproductive justice approach introduced in Part 1 is relevant to their work, and what &#8211; if anything &#8211; might be gained from creating a similar movement in Britain.</p>
<p><strong>Shaming black women</strong></p>
<p>Black British women are, according to Department of Health statistics, more likely to have an abortion than their white counterparts (<a title="Department of Health statistics" href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsStatistics/DH_099285">source</a>).  On the other side of the Atlantic there has been some especially poisonous anti-choice campaigning based around a similar difference. Georgia Right to Life posted 80 billboards around the city of Atlanta proclaiming “Black people are an endangered species”, with a website address: toomanyaborted.com. Loretta Ross, National Co-ordinator of <a href="http://www.sistersong.net/">SisterSong</a>, described it as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a misogynistic attack to shame-and-blame black women who choose abortion, alleging that we endanger the future of our children… Our opponents used a social responsibility frame to claim that black women have a racial obligation to have more babies – especially black male babies &#8212; despite our individual circumstances.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alarmingly, the UK anti-choice movement has already begun to adopt some of the US campaigning messages about the &#8216;black genocide&#8217;. Lisa Hallgarten, Director of <strong><a title="Education for Choice" href="http://www.efc.org.uk">Education for Choice</a></strong>, reported that “the Marie Stopes International clinic in Brixton is routinely picketed by antis who claim that MSI is trying to kill black babies. I have seen leaflets that claim that Brook is a eugenic organisation.” This is just the latest trend in a pattern of UK anti-choicers adopting US campaigning tactics.<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/efc_twitterskin4.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="1381" data-permalink="/2010/12/01/fighting-for-the-facts-about-abortion/efc_twitterskin4/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/efc_twitterskin4.jpg?fit=191%2C95&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="191,95" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="EFC Logo" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/efc_twitterskin4.jpg?fit=191%2C95&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/efc_twitterskin4.jpg?fit=191%2C95&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1381" style="margin: 10px;" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/efc_twitterskin4.jpg?resize=191%2C95" alt="Education for Choice Logo" width="191" height="95" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Reproductive rights</strong></p>
<p>I wanted to know whether the broader ‘reproductive rights’ approach had been adopted in the UK at all, by which I mean looking at contraception, sex education, adoption and the socioeconomic factors which impact on women’s decisions about whether or not to have children <em>alongside</em> calling for the right to safe, legal abortion.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/991.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="3658" data-permalink="/2011/03/03/reproductive-justice-in-the-uk-part-2/attachment/991/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/991.jpg?fit=209%2C96&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="209,96" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Abortion Rights banner" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/991.jpg?fit=209%2C96&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/991.jpg?fit=209%2C96&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3658" style="margin: 10px;" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/991.jpg?resize=209%2C96" alt="Photo showing bright pink and white Abortion Rights banner being carried at an outdoor event with a pink balloon floating in the foreground" width="209" height="96" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Darinka Aleksic, <strong><a title="Abortion Rights" href="http://www.abortionrights.org.uk/">Abortion Rights</a></strong> Campaign Co-ordinator, said that “because British women do not experience the extremes of health inequalities on ethnic or economic grounds that women in the US do (although I’m not minimizing those that exist), the repro rights approach has not, in my opinion, been quite so vital or so relevant to our situation.”</p>
<p>Lisa agreed that a rights-based approach hasn’t been widely adopted: “Since UK policy can be made or broken by the Daily Mail it is hard to take an abstract political or human rights approach to these things”. But she was clear on some of the problems with the existing situation, including the emphasis on abortion as a medical issue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The public health approach is fundamentally limited and limiting because it relies on scientific evidence supporting the role of abortion in public health. For me there is a point where personal autonomy may trump public health and we should always keep our commitment to autonomy at the forefront of discussion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the absence of universal high quality sex education:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lack of sex education is a clear obstacle not just to the people who are young at that point in time, but to society getting better at talking about sex. I think, realistically, that some fundamental work needs to be done on coming to terms with human sexuality as a society before anyone will have the courage or funding to stand up in government and take a reproductive justice approach to these things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Abortion rights and social justice</strong></p>
<p>Finally I asked Lisa and Darinka if it would be helpful to put the campaign to protect and extend abortion rights in the UK in a wider context of social justice, and whether there was a risk of losing support in the medical establishment if it came to be seen as a campaigning issue rather than a question of health policy.</p>
<p>Lisa said that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our whole law was put in place to medicalise the procedure, put it under doctors&#8217; control and protect doctors. I think there is a big danger of losing their support if they don&#8217;t feel ownership of it.</p>
<p>However, the greater danger is that we don&#8217;t have a broad grassroots movement to protect abortion rights in this country. If we built a reproductive justice movement we would have a much more broad-based constituency to come out fighting when our rights are up for grabs in the Commons.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Darinka explained that &#8220;Abortion Rights’ primary role is to defend the 1967 Abortion Act.&#8221; But also that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As an organization that has strong links to the trade union movement, we are inclined to stress the importance of abortion access as an economic issue. It has always been working class women who have suffered from a lack of access to safe, legal abortion.</p>
<p>Public service and spending cuts are going to hit women hardest and the reorganization of the NHS raises real questions about how access to abortion and contraception services will be maintained. So we are campaigning against the cuts alongside other organizations on a broader social justice basis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Reproductive justice for the UK?</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>After talking to Mara, Lisa and Darinka it became clear that there are opportunities for the UK pro-choice movement in the reproductive justice approach, although simply importing the US model wouldn’t work. In Britain public and medical establishment support for the right to choose is far greater, there are fewer differences in access to healthcare along lines of race or sexual orientation, and there is more state support for families.</p>
<p>However, the British sexual and reproductive health landscape is shifting. While the usual attacks on the Abortion Act are being launched in Westminster (and <a href="http://www.abortionrights.org.uk/">Abortion Rights</a> tirelessly resists them) a few more developments have been added to the mix over the last year &#8211; including controversy around the sterilisation of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-11545519">drug addicts</a> and those with severe <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2011/feb/15/forced-sterilisation-mother-court-plea">learning disabilities</a>, the end of the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-11541423">Teenage Pregnancy Strategy</a>, mass popular protests against the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11355258">Pope’s visit</a>, the crisis in <a href="http://www.midirs.org/development/midwiferyweb.nsf/z45/78260C15C81B48088025783A004C6726?opendocument&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=facebook">midwifery</a>, and health professionals calling out <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/feb/09/channel-4-the-joy-of-teen-sex">shoddy sex education</a> in the media.</p>
<p>While there are a whole range of fantastic organizations working variously to defend and extend abortion rights and access, to improve sex education and sexual health, to support families and advance LGBT and women’s rights, to fight racism and inequalities in access to or influence on public services, this work doesn’t take place under a shared banner of Reproductive Justice.</p>
<p>I am a campaigner; I understand the need to choose your battles and your targets carefully. But as the ideological reforms of what is essentially a Tory government start to bite, I wonder if the battle may be coming to us. Perhaps it’s time to build a movement and raise the flag.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ll come clean: I missed most of Ladyfest Ten. And I missed it because I was hungover, on about a thimbleful of wine. But one of the things I did actually manage to see that weekend was the excellent US pro-choice documentary <strong><a href="http://www.thecoathangerproject.com/">The Coat Hanger Project</a></strong>, at a screening organized by <strong><a href="http://www.efc.org.uk/">Education for Choice</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the film there was a section about the ‘reproductive justice’ movement. The interviews intrigued me. It looked exciting, radical, inclusive and even kinda fun. The film featured an endearing group of smart, funny, young activists that reminded me of the<strong> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpQSJjK_ENg">Itty Bitty Titty Committee</a></strong>, which is no bad thing in my book. After a few aspirin I was inspired to find out more…</p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3>What is reproductive justice?<strong> </strong></h3>
<p>Reproductive justice is a holistic, inclusive and intersectional campaign for reproductive rights and the conditions necessary for women to realize them. It is a movement led by women of colour, which addresses the right to have children as well as the right not to have children, expanding the focus out from abortion to include wider questions of sex education, sexuality, birth control and the impact of poverty and violence.  This video is a good introduction: <strong><a href="http://vimeo.com/10604537">What is Reproductive Justice?</a></strong></p>
<p>And here it is on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_justice">Wikipedia</a> for good measure.</p>
<p>I had a quick look online for UK reproductive justice groups or networks, but couldn’t find anything, although the US movement has been around since the 1990s. Of course it’s different terrain &#8211; here’s an <a href="http://www.thefword.org.uk/blog/2010/04/working_in_abortion_education_and_outreach_in_the_uk_and_the_us_whats_the_diff">F Word post</a> about some of the differences between the US and UK around abortion and sex education &#8211; but is the reproductive justice approach relevant to the UK at all?</p>
<h3>Realising reproductive rights</h3>
<p>A key aspect of the reproductive justice approach is integrating pro-choice activism into a wider social justice movement. This is from <strong><a href="http://www.sistersong.net/">SisterSong</a></strong>’s document ‘Understanding Reproductive Justice’:</p>
<blockquote><p>Abortion isolated from other social justice/human rights issues neglects issues of economic justice, the environment, immigrants’ rights, disability rights, discrimination based on race and sexual orientation, and a host of other community-centered concerns directly affecting an individual woman’s decision making process.</p>
<p>By shifting the definition of the problem to one of reproductive oppression (the control and exploitation of women, girls, and individuals through our bodies, sexuality, labor, and reproduction) rather than a narrow focus on protecting the legal right to abortion, we are developing a more inclusive vision of how to move forward in building a new movement.</p></blockquote>
<p>While defending the rights we are lucky enough to have protected by law is vital, the rights become meaningless if people can’t access them, and in many areas social and cultural change and economic equality are needed for people to realise their rights.<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/asn-logo.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="3646" data-permalink="/2011/03/02/reproductive-justice-in-the-uk-part-1/asn-logo/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/asn-logo.jpg?fit=200%2C73&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="200,73" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Abortion Support Network logo" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/asn-logo.jpg?fit=200%2C73&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/asn-logo.jpg?fit=200%2C73&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-3646" style="margin: 10px;" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/asn-logo.jpg?resize=200%2C73" alt="Abortion Support Network logo featuring three grey/black interlinked &quot;female&quot; symbols" width="200" height="73" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>How might this be relevant to the UK pro-choice movement? Although abortion has been legal since 1967, and in theory it is freely available on the NHS, there are major inequalities in access. I spoke to Mara Clarke, founder of the <strong><a href="http://www.abortionsupport.org.uk/">Abortion Support Network</a></strong>, who explains some of the problems:</p>
<blockquote><p>Abortion is available on the NHS, but only if you obtain two doctors&#8217; signatures. This can be difficult if you live in an area with only one GP who is anti-abortion. Access to abortion services can be as much of a postcode lottery as any other service in the UK&#8230; This can make things more difficult for women as not only does the procedure become more invasive the further into pregnancy one gets, but not all clinics perform abortions up to the legal limit. This means some women opt to pay privately for abortions to avoid wait times, where other women have to wait until further in pregnancy and/or travel great distances to obtain the care they require.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks to investment and prioritisation by the previous government, things have improved: 94% of abortions are now funded by the NHS, and waiting times have been drastically reduced. However, these achievements, like many others, are likely to be lost as vicious spending cuts unravel years of positive work.</p>
<p>And in both Northern Ireland &#8211; despite being part of the UK &#8211; and the Republic of Ireland, abortion is illegal except under extremely restricted circumstances. So every year in order to access safe and legal abortion thousands of women are forced to travel to England and pay anywhere between £400 and £2,000 for the cost of the procedure, travel, childcare and time off work. <a title="Abortion Support Network" href="http://www.abortionsupport.org.uk">Abortion Support Network</a> works to help these women by providing financial assistance, information, a meal and a safe place to sleep, but they can’t meet the need on their own.</p>
<p>There’s also a major problem around lack of unbiased information and impartial support around sexual health and pregnancy choices for young people, especially about abortion. Many young women are effectively prevented from making an informed decision because they are misinformed at school, or receive biased advice from bogus counselling services. <a title="Education for Choice" href="http://www.efc.org.uk">Education for Choice</a> work to make sure young people have the facts, but they are a tiny organisation fighting a wealthy anti-choice movement.</p>
<h3>Abortion and race</h3>
<p>The reproductive justice movement particularly addresses the experiences and needs of women of colour around sexual health, parenthood, pregnancy and abortion. While there are not such large differences in access to healthcare by ethnicity in Britain as in the US, there are some patterns. For example, according to Department of Health stats, black British women are almost three times more likely to have an abortion than white women (<a title="Department of Health statistics" href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsStatistics/DH_099285" target="_self">source</a>).  It’s not clear why this is, but when I asked Darinka Aleksic, <a title="Abortion Rights" href="http://www.abortionrights.org.uk/content/view/247/1/">Abortion Rights</a> Campaign Co-ordinator, she suggested an economic explanation:</p>
<blockquote><p>The argument advanced in the US is that because minority ethnic women are more likely to experience poverty and economic disadvantage, the abortion rate among these communities is therefore higher. The Department of Health in England and Wales does not include income levels in its abortion statistics, but Scotland does, and their figures regularly show that abortion rates are higher in economically disadvantaged areas.</p></blockquote>
<p>As Darinka points out, there is a similar discrepancy in US abortion statistics, and there’s more in Part 2 about how this is being used by the anti-choice movement in America and starting to be used by our own merry band of anti-choicers.</p>
