										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s an issue that pirate-fans such as myself and Miranda are very aware of. It&#8217;s an issue that is fairly common to women characters in the fantasy genre and is closely linked to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1wREUcgYgQ" target="_blank">Chainmail Bikini Syndrome</a>. Miranda calls it the Nautical Sexpot Problem.</p>

I bet she&#8217;s cold.</p></div>
<p>We both enjoy reading about and discovering stories about <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/01/20/five-pirate-women-from-the-pages-of-history-number-one-lady-killigrew/" target="_blank">women pirates</a>. </p>
<p>Sadly, they are often <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/04/16/at-the-movies-the-pirates-in-an-adventure-with-scientists/" target="_blank">poorly represented in pop culture</a> and in advertising as little more than the aforementioned nautical sexpots, turning up, as women sadly often do, only to prove that the central male characters are heterosexual and dashing.</p>
<p>The example on the left is a good one. This was taken from a pirate-themed crazy golf park. The male pirates had clothes. And coats. And treasure. All kinds of useful pirate things.</p>
<p>This is the trope we are used to &#8211; men representing the cut and thrust of the character, women thrown in for a bit of titillation (assuming that you like your titillation in this form, and sadly we live in a universe were that is the the assumption).</p>
<p>But all is not lost, me hearties!</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a sea-change coming. If we set sail to Hastings, that lesser known bastion of cut-throat feminism, there is a weather-beaten and battered but nonetheless awesome figure of a woman pirate on the roof of a restaurant.</p>
<p>A far cry from scantily-clad mermaids attempting to flog battered cod and chips &#8211; and a very refreshing change, as well as two fingers up to all the people who think that a woman&#8217;s place is <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/02/21/an-alphabet-of-femininism-19-s-is-for-ship/" target="_blank">stapled to the prow of a ship</a>.</p>

Now you&#8217;re talking.</p></div>
<p>No high seas bikini here! She&#8217;s got an outfit suitable for Proper Adventuring, she&#8217;s steering a boat, and she&#8217;s got treasure, which (aside from clothing that protects you from the elements and your enemies) is what every pirate wants.</p>
<p>Throw in the eyepatch and a pet crow (plus points for cool animal companion) and she&#8217;s ready to plunder the high seas.</p>
<p>So, aside from the fact that we&#8217;ve finally (finally!) got a female character in a similar position and costume to male characters, what really makes this a Found Feminism for me is the placement: we&#8217;re so used to having female characters as the special, odd one out, look-at-me-I&#8217;m-a-girl that having this figure here without any particular attention drawn to it makes it all the better.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a special Lady Pirate Restaurant, it&#8217;s just a bit of pirate ship decor which also happens to have a normalised, non-stereotyped female pirate aboard.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve long flown the flag for giving women characters equal weighting in stories, especially fantasy and sci-fi fiction, where writers and audiences get the joy of experiencing other worlds that aren&#8217;t bound by the tedious social rules of our own &#8211; including sexism.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Exciting news! My very favourite film, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_in_the_Sky"><strong>Laputa</strong></a> (aka <strong>Castle In The Sky</strong>) has just appeared on YouTube with its rare original English dub rather than the grotesque Disney version featuring James Van Der Beek. This is, of course, bad and wrong and you definitely shouldn&#8217;t go and watch it all.</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/sheeta.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="9632" data-permalink="/2012/02/01/laputa-skypirates-against-the-patriarchy/sheeta/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/sheeta.jpg?fit=480%2C272&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="480,272" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Sheeta" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/sheeta.jpg?fit=300%2C170&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/sheeta.jpg?fit=480%2C272&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-9632" title="Sheeta" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/sheeta-300x170.jpg?resize=300%2C170" alt="Sheeta, with flying machine frame in background. Copyright Studio Ghibli 1986" width="300" height="170" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/sheeta.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/sheeta.jpg?w=480&amp;ssl=1 480w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>It&#8217;s the first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_Ghibli">Studio Ghibli</a> film proper, and it&#8217;s a corker, containing two reasonably kickass female characters, a steam train chase, skypirates, magic crystals, airships, a mysterious floating city and some damn fine robots. It&#8217;s a sort of steampunk sci-fi ecofable. It even has a section set in what is clearly a parallel universe Welsh mining town, inspired by Hayao Miyazaki&#8217;s trip to Wales and interest in the miners&#8217; strike in the early 1980s.</p>
<p>Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli can generally be relied upon for more interesting and resourceful <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2011/jul/14/studio-ghibli-arrietty-heroines">heroines</a> than your average Disney or Pixar fodder, even if they are a bit, er identically similar. But in <strong>Laputa</strong> you can read the whole film as a condemnation of patriarchal power. Seriously – the government, the military and the monarchy line up against a girl and her male friend (who represent the future, protecting one another and fighting alongside each other as equals) and a band of pirates captained by a truly formidable woman.</p>
<p>There is a bit of a science vs nature theme, but it&#8217;s not clear cut, as the pirates rely on technology as much as the military do. Technology and nature are shown to be in harmony in the great overgrown gardens of the ancient city of Laputa, tended for centuries by a solitary robot.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to the womens. Orphan Sheeta is the central character, and although she might at first seem more passive than the Ghibli girls to come in <strong>Spirited Away</strong>, <strong>My Neighbour Totoro</strong> and <strong>Howl&#8217;s Moving Castle</strong>, she is quietly courageous, getting in a fair bit of fighting, struggling, attacking, escaping and running away. In the dramatic first minutes of the film, for example, she acts boldly and bravely and strikes out against her captors:</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/mMBHGma-3lQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth bearing in mind that <strong>Laputa</strong> came out in 1986, and Sheeta represented a fairly significant departure from your average anime heroine at that point. As well as being smart, resourceful and brave, Sheeta is powerful. Interestingly, she inherits this power &#8211; in the form of the &#8216;levitation stone&#8217;, a secret true name and powerful magic spells &#8211; from her mother.</p>
<p>Although her counterpart, the headstrong Pazu, styles himself as her protector, and does do a bit of rescuing, the traditional gender roles are blurred. Rebecca Johnson highlights this in her essay <a href="http://rhizomes.net/issue14/johnson/johnson.html">Kawaii and kirei: Navigating the Identities of Women in &#8216;Laputa: Castle in the Sky&#8217; by Hayao Miyazaki and &#8216;Ghost in the Shell&#8217; by Mamoru Oshii</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Even the role reversal displayed between Sheeta and Pazu is prominent, questioning the notion of gender roles that men and women take. For example, Sheeta tries to protect Pazu after their initial capture by the army, denying that she needs help. In this instance, both characters are &#8220;damsels in distress&#8221; since they are both under the threat of the army. Instead of taking on a traditional role as a damsel, Sheeta takes on the male role of protector.</p></blockquote>

<p>There are also two scenes in which Pazu cooks for them both, which is a little thing, but it makes me happy. Go go normalizing atypical gender behaviours!</p>
<p>In the climactic scene they stand side by side, holding hands as equals, and act together as their (feminine) compassion compels them to an act of terrific (masculine) violence and destruction in which they sacrifice themselves for the greater good.</p>
<p>The other main female character, piratical matriarch Dola, is just wonderful. She&#8217;s a bit like Granny Weatherwax crossed with Desperate Dan. Here she is outsmarting, outfighting and outrunning her burly band of sons (she appears around five minutes in):</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/N2fU-J_UYo4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>My favourite bit is the way she discards her skirt when things start to kick off. Rebecca Johnson sees Dola as a particularly radical character in the context of the dominant social ideals of Japanese womanhood. As she says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dola treats the world around her as personal territory without fear or hesitancy. Leading her family, a band of pirates, she is a take charge woman who shows her Japanese audience that women are more than capable of casting away the kawaii syndrome plaguing them&#8230;</p>
<p>The Japanese word for mother is &#8220;okasan&#8221; which literally means &#8220;the person at the back of the house&#8221;. However, it is safe to assume that Dola, as her sons&#8217; captain, is far from being &#8220;the woman at the back of the house.&#8221; Really, Dola is defying the common stereotype of Japanese women because her success is not being measured in terms of the motherly and wifely capabilities by which many contemporary Japanese women are judged. The common Japanese phrase &#8220;women are weak but mothers are strong&#8221; is one-sided, and proved wrong by Dola. Her characterization and actions show that she is not only a strong mother but a smart and strong woman in her own regard too.</p></blockquote>
<p>For all her ferocity and ruthlessness, Dola does have a compassionate side and becomes deeply protective of the two orphans once they have proved themselves to her. <a href="http://www.arcadean.com/?p=58">Arcadean</a> has an interesting analysis of Dola&#8217;s shifting gender identity, although I don&#8217;t completely agree with it.</p>
<p>Even now the film fills me with wonder, and the original score and use of silence (intolerable to Disney, apparently) is full of beauty. It left a lasting impression, and is probably responsible for my interest in anime and manga, and certainly for my profound love of robots. And I reckon you could do a lot worse on the role model front than Sheeta and Dola.</p>
