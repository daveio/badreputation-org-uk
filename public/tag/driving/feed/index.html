					<description><![CDATA[She was arrested and imprisoned for 10 days for daring to drive. She's not the only one.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This post is part of a series on the theme of women and protest. The full series is collected <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/tag/revolting-women/">under the tag &#8220;Revolting Women&#8221;</a>.</em></p>
<p>So, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jun/17/saudi-arabia-women-drivers-protest?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487">this happened</a>.</p>
<p>In case you&#8217;ve been on the other side of the moon these past few months, the media&#8217;s much-touted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring">Arab Spring</a> had an interesting tangent via a discussion in the Saudi Council on whether women in Saudi Arabia should be allowed the vote. They eventually decided that yes, <a href="http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/311355">they probably should&#8230; eventually</a>. We wouldn&#8217;t want to rush these things. They won&#8217;t be able to contest the elections, of course, but least &#8211; if King Abdullah considers the recommendations &#8211; they may be able to cast a vote in the municipal elections.</p>
<p>Except that this small pittance of representation didn&#8217;t seem to be <a href="http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/saudi-arabia/saudi-s-vote-for-women-comes-a-little-late-activists-say-1.818813">satisfactory for women in Saudi Arabia</a>. So&#8230; well, see for yourselves. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowNSH_W2r0">Here is Manal al-Sharif driving in Saudi Arabia, and discussing what it means for her to do so</a>.</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/sowNSH_W2r0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>She was arrested and imprisoned for 10 days for daring to drive.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s not the only one. There&#8217;s an <a href="http://www.falsafh.com/vb/t7868.html">entire site of these vids</a> (<a href="http://www.saudiwomendriving.blogspot.com/">in fact</a>, <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=saudi+women+driving&amp;hl=en&amp;biw=1259&amp;bih=599&amp;prmd=ivnsu&amp;source=univ&amp;tbm=vid&amp;tbo=u&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AJnuTY-DCYyVswamo43vAw&amp;ved=0CG4QqwQ">more than one</a>): women driving in Saudi Arabia, in protest at&#8230; well, mostly not being allowed to drive. Here&#8217;s a <a href="https://twitter.com/@women2drive">twitter feed</a> of them doing it in style. In fact, June 17 saw 30 or 40 women behind the wheel, following weeks of an online campaign that saw women taping or photographing themselves driving. (If you&#8217;re wondering whether 30-40 people is a lot, consider what happened <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-13809684">the last time women tested this ban</a>. Think about what &#8216;punishment&#8217; means in Saudi Arabia. Then try to imagine being one of those women out there on 17 June.)</p>
<p>There is, of course, a danger to conflating correlation and causality. Yes, women protesting by driving happened to take place at about the same time that women&#8217;s voting rights were being revived for discussion in Saudi Arabia. It could have been a massive coincidence, and 30-40 women, however courageous, hardly make up a political movement all by themselves. And anyway, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Saudi_Arabian_protests">what does driving have to do with political representation</a>?</p>
<p><strong>The Times</strong>&#8216;s Janice Turner is pretty clear where she stands in a now-paywalled article titled <em>The Freedom of the Road is a Feminist Issue</em>. Consider being a woman in Saudi Arabia. Ignore all the discussions about political representation for the moment, and focus instead on the daily grind. You get up, you get dressed, you have to go to work or to the market or whatever. Luckily, your husband has hired you a car with your very own (male) driver&#8230; and should he feel perfectly comfortable in <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jCjEMaKSS2DG4aQE69Xd7dF-N_OA?docId=CNG.a3efd0be8f9ab484f7bd5528447add10.3d1">sexually assaulting you</a>, there is nothing you can do about it.</p>
<p>Or how about you forgo the potential dubious safety of a hired car and opt for a taxi. Prepare to walk the streets trying to hail one: streets where your mere presence outdoors may be cast as a sexual provocation. Inevitably, in trying to lock women away &#8216;for their own protection&#8217;, lest they be seen by vociferous male eyes, the Wahhabi religious laws have created a space so deeply hostile and threatening to women that their mere presence is transgressive. It is little wonder, then, that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manal_al-Sharif">Manal al-Sharif</a> talks about how safe she feels in her car, with her doors locked.</p>
<p>A person&#8217;s first car has always symbolised their freedom: be it at 17, with their newly-minted license and the entirety of the countryside filled with welcoming ditches to drive it into, or at 50, with a newly-issued divorce and a hesitant rediscovery of independent living. A woman who has a car gets to choose the place she is occupying. If she wants to leave, she is not dependent on anyone else. What could be more terrifying to the Saudi religious leaders? Never mind that neither the Koran nor the law bans women from driving; they were so terrified at the freedom driving would afford women that they went ahead and <a href="http://www.equalitynow.org/node/837">issued a fatwa</a> just to be safe.</p>

<p>So what actually happened on June 17th, when these 30-40 women took to the road? Did governments fall or cities rock? Reports differ. For one thing, no one can agree on the number. Even the <strong>Guardian</strong> seems confused, using the 30-40 figure in one article, and &#8220;<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/jun/18/saudi-arabia-women-drivers-protest">at least 45</a>&#8221; in another. The government of Saudi Arabia is in flat-out denial, refusing to acknowledge that the protest happened at all (despite a traffic ticket being issued).</p>
<p>Two weeks on, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jun/29/saudi-women-drivers-arrested-jiddah">five of the drivers were arrested</a>, despite early comments from the government that they would allow their families to &#8216;<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jun/30/saudi-arabia-not-egypt-reform">deal with them</a>&#8216;. Despite this, campaigners are not deterred, continuing to maintain a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-13928215">significant social media presence</a>. And even before the protest took place the Shoura declare that <a href="http://arabnews.com/saudiarabia/article447421.ece">they were ready to discuss women driving &#8220;if requested</a>&#8220;. I&#8217;m thinking that women risking arrest in order to parallel park in Riyadh would qualify as such.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Manal al-Sharif hasn&#8217;t given up. Since her release from custody, the former prisoner of conscience has been <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14240340">spearheading a movement to teach more and more women how to drive</a>. With the moderate King Abdullah on the throne, and the authorities apparently turning a blind eye to the recent on-road excursions by <a href="http://saudiwomendriving.blogspot.com/2011/09/emirates-247-reports-that-during-eid-al.html">three women during Eid</a>, it looks like the driving ban may not be in place for much longer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to X &amp; Y Communications, an agency (apparently) specialising in the impact of gender differences on business, <a title="Daily Telegraph: What Do Women Want From Cars" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/columnists/neil-lyndon/8294019/What-do-women-want-from-cars.html" target="_blank"> women ask themselves one fundamental question</a> when contemplating the  purchase of a car. Is it the price?, I hear you wonder. Is it the safety  rating, or the fuel efficiency?</p>
<p>No. It&#8217;s: <em>&#8220;Will it make me look hotter when I step out of it outside a bar or restaurant?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Yes, the main thing that will make a woman decide on a particular car is how &#8216;hot&#8217; she feels in it. <strong>Telegraph</strong><em> </em>writer  Neil Lyndon &#8211; bemoaning the fact that his wife&#8217;s friend opted  for a car she liked and he deemed useless &#8211; goes on to tell us all about the new  Citroën DS3, decorated by graphic artist <a title="Orla Kiely" href="http://www.orlakiely.com/uk/" target="_blank">Orla Kiely</a>.  Now you really will be able to match your car to your handbag. Isn&#8217;t  that snazzy, girls? All your tricksy car decisions solved by this one  simple, fashionable step!</p>

<p>According to Lyndon, his wife&#8217;s divorced friend ignored all sensible, practical considerations when making her car choice, and simply went for a pretty French hatchback. Because that&#8217;s what women do, of course: we go for the pretty option despite it possibly being on fire.</p>
<p>The thing is &#8211; and this will come as no surprise to those familiar with his prior work &#8211; Lyndon is talking complete twaddle. According to AutoEbid.com&#8217;s <a title="AutoEbid.com's Help Me Choose a New Car" href="http://www.autoebid.com/help-me-choose.asp">Help Me Choose a New Car</a> function, you can choose from six factors when trying to find the perfect car for you. They are: Comfort, Styling, Handling, Depreciation, Economy, and Safety. The price is a liming criterion: the thing that helps you to narrow your choice, rather than the main principle of selection. In fact, unless you are going into the market with an extremely limited amount of money, the cost of the car will only ever help you to select a class, or possibly a financing option. Put it another way: no one will switch from a brand-new Fiat 500 to a second-hand Volvo XC90, even though both can be had for roughly £10k.</p>
<p>So how do people choose cars, then, if it&#8217;s not the price?</p>
<p>1. First and foremost, functionality. What are you going to use the car for? If you have five children that will need running to school every morning, you will probably end up with that Volvo. If, on the other hand, you&#8217;re looking for an urban runabout, something small and easy to park is probably better.</p>
<p>2. Up there as a consideration is styling: you want it to look good. In fact, certain TV shows have gone so far as to have an entire segment over whether <a title="The Cool Wall" href="http://topgear.cloudapp.net/default.aspx">a car is &#8216;cool&#8217; or not</a>. The guide there, by the way, is whether a cool person would drive it. Perhaps X &amp; Y Communications neglected to canvas the Top Gear audience in their research.</p>
<p>3. The last, all encompassing question is: I live with it? This includes things like reliability, fuel economy, ability to park it in London, whether the suspension will destroy your spine the first time you drive over road-humps.</p>
<p>The &#8216;price&#8217; question helps to narrow your options, and, on occasion, to disabuse you of the notion that you really could afford to buy a supercar if you sell the house and both kidneys.</p>
<p>The key question Lyndon ignored was what his wife&#8217;s friend wanted in a car: she wanted a cute little urban runabout that would cheer her up in the mornings. Put simply, she wanted that &#8216;new car&#8217; feeling: you&#8217;ve chosen well, your car looks good, and you love it more than it is natural to love an inanimate object. If she was a man lovingly polishing his vintage (decrepit) Rolls, Lyndon would have smiled indulgently.</p>
<p>What Lyndon is bemoaning is not women&#8217;s tendency to pick cars that  make them look good &#8211; we all do that. No one has ever looked at a car and thought, &#8220;sure, it&#8217;s beautiful, but given the choice I&#8217;d go for the ugly, uncomfortable one on the left.&#8221;  Our budgets and priorities may vary, but the  intent remains the same. You buy the thing that makes you feel happy  when you&#8217;re inside it. Lyndon seems to have forgotten that, or have  momentarily blanked out all car adverts, ever. It&#8217;s such an established  cliché that car makers can now produce meta-tastic pastiches of previous  ads and we lap it up. Check out this Volvo V60 &#8220;How to make a sexy car  advert&#8221; clip:</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/xKNsF7Cg2U4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>When you sell a lifestyle, of course you&#8217;re going to sell a cool,  stylish one. Only a fool would try to market a boring car for boring  people.</p>

<p>Of course, that&#8217;s really the thing Lyndon is taking an issue with. <em>He</em> wanted his wife&#8217;s friend to go away and make a list of her  requirements, and bring back the top three cars that fulfilled them. He  would then counsel her to make the reasoned, practical decision. <em>She</em> wanted to buy a cool hatchback following a messy divorce. The thing is,  women going through messy divorces are not meant to want cool  hatchbacks. They&#8217;re not meant to want anything funky or stylish. They  should be worried about making ends meet, and where the rent is coming  from, and how they&#8217;re going to get to work now that their ex-husband has custody of the car. No divorced woman should want to look or feel  attractive, and she certainly shouldn&#8217;t be be gallivanting around bars or restaurants. I could choose this point to make a catty comment about how  Lyndon left his wife for another woman, <a title="No More Sex War" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/More-Sex-War-Neil-Lyndon/dp/0749315652/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1298924959&amp;sr=8-2">published a book </a>railing against  the &#8220;universal dominance of feminism&#8221; and has since been struggling to  rebuild his career.</p>
<p>Lyndon&#8217;s article reveals nothing about gender or, indeed, about car choice (and I highly doubt the odious Mr Lyndon chose his  own car based on a set of requirements and flowcharts). All it shows us is how deep his prejudices still lie: a woman who is hard up and urgently needs a car should not, in Lyndon&#8217;s  world, get to make that sort of choice. Having asked his advice, she  should have acknowledged his superiority and allowed him to select one  for her. After all, her preference for a &#8220;chic little French-made hatchback&#8221;  instantly indicated to him that she must not have the know-how to do it  herself.</p>
<p>And as for the Citroën DS3, the target of Lyndon&#8217;s ire: well, it&#8217;s not doing too badly, despite Lyndon&#8217;s contempt. It&#8217;s just been named <strong>Top Gear Magazine</strong>&#8216;s <a title="Top Gear Magazine 2010 Car of the Year" href="http://www.topgear.com/uk/photos/the-2010-top-gear-awards?imageNo=1">2010 Car of the Year</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My model engine has arrived!</p>
<p>Let me tell you about it. It is a simplified, reasonably accurate version of a four-stroke engine, and it comes with its very own Haynes manual. It’s also entirely plastic and aimed at ages 10+. Bollocks, I say. If I had kids that age, I wouldn’t let them anywhere near the thing with their wickedly sharp craft knives. They&#8217;d have their fingers off before the first tea break.</p>

Like Airfix, only not.</p></div>
<p>Let me back up a bit. <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/02/17/secret-diary-of-a-female-petrolhead/">A few months ago, I decided that I was going to learn about engines.</a> I’ve always been a bit hazy on the theory behind internal combustion, and despite my father’s repeated attempts to explain, I’ve never really been able to get it straight in my head. This could have something to do with his insistence on explaining over the dinner table, rather than opening up the bonnet of his car and explaining there. (My brother got the lecture over the open bonnet of the car. <em>He</em> got so bored he fell asleep.)</p>
<p>This will all be a lot easier to grasp if I can actually do it myself. If I can take apart an engine and put it back together, you can be reasonably certain that I’ll know how it works afterwards. OK, maybe I’ll explode the back garden a couple of times, but I’ve accepted that as an inevitable consequence.</p>
<p>Miraculously, my new-found zeal is shared by a colleague of mine. She, too, wants to strip down an engine and see what makes it tick. Excellent! We ordered a plastic model to assemble in order to get a vague idea of what it will all involve, before thinking about taking things a little further. While we waited for the model to arrive, we may have become a little… unruly. Rowdy. Noisy. Obnoxious? Surely not!</p>
<p>After one of our exchanges, a colleague came up to me. She works in HR. You know the type: perfect hair, perfect nails, perfect smile. Was my enthusiasm too, er, enthusiastic?</p>
<p>“I just wanted to say, what you’re doing is fantastic,” she murmured quietly, and straightened the strand of pearls at her neck. “I love my car, I’d kill any fucker who so much as touched it. There’s nothing quite like a good engine purring, you know?”</p>
<p>I didn’t know, actually, but I nodded just the same.</p>
<p>The next day, another colleague was delivering some papers over my lunch hour when she saw the driving lessons website open in my browser. “Oh, are you learning to drive? Good for you! I learned in Nairobi, I thought I’d be quite frightened and sedate but it turned out I was a real girl racer, I nearly failed because I was speeding the entire time…”</p>
<p>I’m guessing that speeding will not be encouraged in London.</p>
<p>The next day, colleague Y came up to me, very upset, and drew me away from my desk. “I heard that you and colleague X are rebuilding an engine!” she said, looking very upset. Well, yes. Was this against her ethical beliefs? Was I in trouble with the ‘cycle to work’ initiative?</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you invite me?”</p>
<p>The thing is, I haven’t really mentioned this that much at work, despite being giddy with it for months. The people that have found out about it have either nodded sagely about how many times I&#8217;ll set myself on fire, or raved about how brilliant it all is. Invariably, my young female colleagues have fallen into the latter category. They’ve also taken the opportunity to ask me what I thought about the new Pagani (undecided, and I miss the Zonda R), the One-77 (I do like it, but why is it so angry? It looks like it’s been munching on stray pets) and plus, wouldn’t it be nice if the off-road vehicles didn’t kill your spine every time you went off road? (Seriously, Toyota, sort it out.) All of this was delivered in hushed tones over the tea and coffee, and by the time we were back at our desks we were very firmly back on either the Sudan referendum or the receptionist’s new hairstyle.</p>

<p>Why? Was what we were talking about so shocking that it wasn’t fit for general consumption? Would the office spontaneously explode if it turned out that the female accountants and aid workers in my organisation actually knew their Nissans from their Nobles? Why did they get so embarrassed talking about it?</p>
<p>“Well,” colleague X said philosophically, “I didn’t get into cars before because I thought that it was a traditional male thing. And that didn’t mean that I couldn’t do it, but blokes would know more about it than me starting off, and I didn’t want to feel stupid. Then it turned out that they knew just as little as I did.”</p>
<p>Two hours later, a male colleague decided to ask condescendingly what kind of engine we’d be rebuilding. Would it be, he said, sneering, a rotating one?</p>
<p>&#8220;A Wankel rotary?&#8221; I asked. No. It would be a four-stroke.</p>
