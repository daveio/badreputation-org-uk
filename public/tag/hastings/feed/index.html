										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Somewhere in a little seaside town (Hastings) there is a very, very feminist street. Pelham Place, to be precise, with its pretty white fronted houses, looking out towards the sea.</p>
<p>Not a hotbed of radical political lady-times, and yet it&#8217;s been home to not one, but two awesome women. Briefly, it was also frequented by our editor Miranda this autumn, so technically that makes it three, and the temptation to create Bad Reputation plaques, possibly as <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/10/22/found-feminism-rubber-face-putin/" target="_blank">stickers</a>, is actually quite strong.</p>
<p>Anyway, here&#8217;s the street&#8230;</p>

<p><em><br />
Barbara Leigh Smith Bodichon, 1827-1891, Educational pioneer and campaigner for women&#8217;s rights and artist. Lived here 1830-1853.</p>
<p>Muriel Matters-Porter, 1877-1969, Adelaide born activist and first woman to &#8216;speak&#8217; in the House of Commons. Lived in this house 1949-1969.</em></p>
<p>The two women in question, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Bodichon" target="_blank">Barbara Bodichon</a> and<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muriel_Matters" target="_blank"> Muriel Matters</a>, are not only pleasingly alliterative but also both very cool people in their own way.</p>
<p>Barbara was a formidable lady. Born out of wedlock to a reasonably wealthy and very forward-thinking father, she had an &#8220;unusual upbringing&#8221; by all accounts (well, here&#8217;s<a href="http://www.victorianweb.org/gender/wojtczak/bodichon.html" target="_blank"> an account that says that</a>).</p>
<p>Bodichon was an artist who travelled Europe, and she was heavily involved in women&#8217;s suffrage. She is credited with helping campaign for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Married_Women%27s_Property_Act_1882" target="_blank">Married Women&#8217;s Property Act</a>, a step towards independant financial security for women which allowed them to own and control their own property.</p>
<p>She also set up the <a href="http://www.ncse.ac.uk/headnotes/ewj.html"><strong>English Women&#8217;s Journal</strong></a> to discuss issues pertaining to womens&#8217; rights, and founded<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girton_College,_Cambridge"> Girton College</a>, Cambridge.</p>
<p>As an aside, her family is related by marriage to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonham_Carter_family">Bonham Carter family</a> which contains both Florence Nightingale and, eventually, Helena Bonham Carter, a BadRep Towers favourite, so there&#8217;s clearly something going on in this family and they deserve watching.</p>
<p>Muriel Matters, meanwhile, was born in Australia, moving to the UK to participate in the suffrage movement, where she became known for being somewhat militant and outrageous in her attempts to gain publicity for the cause (including <a href="http://www.hastingspress.co.uk/history/muriel.htm" target="_blank">hiring a dirigible</a>).</p>
<p>She was also a campaigner against slums and poverty and an early teacher of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montessori_method">Montessori Method</a>. She stood as a candidate for the Labour Party in 1924.</p>
<p>Matters lived in the house on Pelham Street, which was a nursing home, until her death, the later part of her life focusing on what is coyly described by Wikipedia as &#8220;the local community&#8221;, and spending time being a pretty great lady of letters.</p>
<p>I can only imagine what it must have been like to campaign so ardently for change and to see it realised in your lifetime, then to go on and survive through the war, all the way to to the revolutions of the 1960s. It&#8217;s only when presented with those dates that I can begin to appreciate the scale and speed of the feminist project, that so much happened within these two overlapping lifetimes. It&#8217;s inspirational to think about what could be achieved within <em>our</em> lifetimes.</p>
<p>The two didn&#8217;t overlap when they lived at Pelham Place, sadly, and my Google-fu doesn&#8217;t reveal any evidence they actually ever met, but that&#8217;s certainly a Fantasy Dinner party guest list to think about.</p>
<p>I like the <a href="http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/publications/celebrating-people-and-place/commemorative-plaques-guidance-pt1.pdf">Blue Plaque project</a>. I like any kind of history you can pick up just by looking up whilst you&#8217;re walking along. It&#8217;s nice to be able to put things in context and to see the past as places with real people rather than objects in a museum.</p>
<p>But this combination in particular strikes a chord with me, possibly because it is so unusual. And it&#8217;s the standout element here that makes this a Found Feminism.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s face it, most commemorative plaques are about men &#8211; <a href="http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/discover/people-and-places/womens-history/women-celebrated-by-blue-plaques/">English Heritage is working to tackle this issue</a> &#8211; and the coverage of women&#8217;s rights is often a late addition to the table. The Pankhursts didn&#8217;t get their plaque intil 2006, for example, so to have two together is impressive.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s to Pelham Place, and to Hastings!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s an issue that pirate-fans such as myself and Miranda are very aware of. It&#8217;s an issue that is fairly common to women characters in the fantasy genre and is closely linked to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1wREUcgYgQ" target="_blank">Chainmail Bikini Syndrome</a>. Miranda calls it the Nautical Sexpot Problem.</p>

She is wearing a very short fawn skirt and we can see part of her bottom. Her top half is barely covered by a cut-off shirt tied over large breasts." width="224" height="300" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/sexy-pirate-chick.jpg?w=224&amp;ssl=1 224w, https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/sexy-pirate-chick.jpg?w=764&amp;ssl=1 764w, https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/sexy-pirate-chick.jpg?w=968&amp;ssl=1 968w" sizes="(max-width: 224px) 100vw, 224px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-12735" class="wp-caption-text">Shiver me timbers. I bet she&#8217;s cold.</p></div>
<p>We both enjoy reading about and discovering stories about <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/01/20/five-pirate-women-from-the-pages-of-history-number-one-lady-killigrew/" target="_blank">women pirates</a>. </p>
<p>Sadly, they are often <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/04/16/at-the-movies-the-pirates-in-an-adventure-with-scientists/" target="_blank">poorly represented in pop culture</a> and in advertising as little more than the aforementioned nautical sexpots, turning up, as women sadly often do, only to prove that the central male characters are heterosexual and dashing.</p>
<p>The example on the left is a good one. This was taken from a pirate-themed crazy golf park. The male pirates had clothes. And coats. And treasure. All kinds of useful pirate things.</p>
<p>This is the trope we are used to &#8211; men representing the cut and thrust of the character, women thrown in for a bit of titillation (assuming that you like your titillation in this form, and sadly we live in a universe were that is the the assumption).</p>
<p>But all is not lost, me hearties!</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a sea-change coming. If we set sail to Hastings, that lesser known bastion of cut-throat feminism, there is a weather-beaten and battered but nonetheless awesome figure of a woman pirate on the roof of a restaurant.</p>
<p>A far cry from scantily-clad mermaids attempting to flog battered cod and chips &#8211; and a very refreshing change, as well as two fingers up to all the people who think that a woman&#8217;s place is <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/02/21/an-alphabet-of-femininism-19-s-is-for-ship/" target="_blank">stapled to the prow of a ship</a>.</p>

Now you&#8217;re talking.</p></div>
<p>No high seas bikini here! She&#8217;s got an outfit suitable for Proper Adventuring, she&#8217;s steering a boat, and she&#8217;s got treasure, which (aside from clothing that protects you from the elements and your enemies) is what every pirate wants.</p>
<p>Throw in the eyepatch and a pet crow (plus points for cool animal companion) and she&#8217;s ready to plunder the high seas.</p>
<p>So, aside from the fact that we&#8217;ve finally (finally!) got a female character in a similar position and costume to male characters, what really makes this a Found Feminism for me is the placement: we&#8217;re so used to having female characters as the special, odd one out, look-at-me-I&#8217;m-a-girl that having this figure here without any particular attention drawn to it makes it all the better.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a special Lady Pirate Restaurant, it&#8217;s just a bit of pirate ship decor which also happens to have a normalised, non-stereotyped female pirate aboard.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve long flown the flag for giving women characters equal weighting in stories, especially fantasy and sci-fi fiction, where writers and audiences get the joy of experiencing other worlds that aren&#8217;t bound by the tedious social rules of our own &#8211; including sexism.</p>
