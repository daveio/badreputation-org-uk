<p>We like it when people we think are cool come out as feminists, or even just express views broadly in line with feminist ideas. It makes  us feel cool. And if we can&#8217;t feel cool, we don&#8217;t wanna be part of the  revolution. More seriously, it&#8217;s important to celebrate that folk come  to feminism through all sorts of different routes and in their own time.</p>
<p>Whenever a person has a feminist revelation of the sort that we might think is obvious (such as the lack of good female role models in certain music genres), instead of going &#8220;well, duh?!&#8221; and getting cross, here at BR Towers we go &#8220;hey, yeah! Grab a drink and join the party.&#8221;</p>
<p>First up, <a href="http://en.academic.ru/dic.nsf/enwiki/309843">Jade Puget</a>, guitarist for chart-topping emo-punksters <a href="http://www.afireinside.net/">AFI</a> and one half  of EBM/dance project <a href="http://www.blaqkaudio.com/splash/">Blaqk Audio</a>, realises there are <a href="http://shyboyswin.blogspot.com/2010/06/i-was-reading-one-of-my.html">barely any women in  his beloved electronica</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>I was reading one of my computer/electronic music  nerd alert magazines  today and I noticed that every one of these acclaimed electronic  producers is male. I realized that the electronic music scene is almost  completely male-dominated. &#8230;. we need a lady-led revolution in the  scene, girls making ill breakbeat  hardcore, wobbly dubstep basslines, 20 minute psybient epics.</p></blockquote>
<p>Next, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayley_Williams">Hayley Williams</a>, lead singer in chart-topping emo-pop-rockers <a href="http://www.paramore.net/">Paramore</a>, declares that<a href="http://yelyahwilliams.tumblr.com/post/3515761303/after-finishing-charlie-chaplins-own-story"> she&#8217;s researching Riot Grrrl</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>After finishing “Charlie Chaplin’s Own Story”.. I’m currently reading <a href="http://www.girlstothefront.com/"> this book</a>. Mostly to satisfy my thirst for knowledge on the Riot Grrrl  Movement in the 90’s and bands such as Bikini Kill and Bratmobile. But  I’m finding more and more that I wish my 13 year old self could’ve read  it. Girls, women, ladies: check it out!</p></blockquote>
<p>Both posts may have been up a little while, but finding them at the same time brought a smile.  I love that both of these excerpts reveal the demand for women past and present in the music business, and that rather than merely noting absences they are positive calls for action, alongside ways to get involved.</p>
