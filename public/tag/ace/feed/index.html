<p>Have you ever looked at superheroines today and thought &#8220;Hmmm&#8230; they could be a bit more comfy.&#8221; All that spandex and those costumes with holes cut out, don&#8217;t they ever get cold? Don&#8217;t they ever just want to put their slippers on and relax?</p>
<p>Well, artist <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/OniYon?ref=seller_info"><strong>Hanie Mohd</strong></a> must have thought the same thing, because she&#8217;s got a whole series of prints on Etsy featuring super girls in sweaters, and they&#8217;re super cute, too! She&#8217;s got Power Girl, Catwoman, Oracle, Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, Rogue from the X-Men and Stephanie Brown&#8217;s Batgirl. I wonder who she&#8217;ll draw next?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/88733783/power-girl-in-a-sweater-art-print"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/il_570xN.296256866-215x300.jpg?resize=155%2C216" alt="Power Girl wears her usual white costume, but it looks a lot moire comfy and sweater-like than usual." width="155" height="216" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>I&#8217;ve bought the <a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/88011255/catwoman-in-a-sweater-art-print">Catwoman print</a>, and after all the hullabaloo about how much Catwoman was or wasn&#8217;t wearing in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_52">DC52</a>, there&#8217;s something that&#8217;s quite comforting about seeing Selina in a kitty sweater. Doesn&#8217;t she just look so happy to be wearing it?</p>
<h2>The SFX Weekender</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.sfxweekender.com/"><strong>SFX Weekender</strong></a> is an annual sci-fi convention run by <a href="http://www.sfx.co.uk/"><strong>SFX Magazine</strong></a>; it took place in Rye in the south of England in 2010 and 2011, and this year it&#8217;s based in Wales at Prestatyn Sands, from the 2nd to the 5th of February. There are events for those who love comics, gaming, SF movies and books, and unlike what might be thought of as a &#8216;typical&#8217; sci-fi convention<a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/10/20/awesomewatch-or-things-which-are-awesome-right-now-by-jenni-aged-24-34/"></a> there are always loads of women there enjoying the show.</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/weekender_redux25-600x489.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/weekender_redux25-600x489-300x244.jpg?resize=240%2C195" alt="the glowing blue banner logo for the sfx weekender" width="240" height="195" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>I&#8217;ve been before, and I&#8217;m going again, this year they&#8217;ve got stellar guests such as Alex Kingston, who plays River Song in <strong>Doctor Who</strong>, and Eve Myles who plays Gwen in <strong>Torchwood</strong>. There&#8217;s also Hattie Hayridge, the standup comedienne who plays Holly in <strong>Red Dwarf</strong> and Sophie Aldred, who used to play the Doctor&#8217;s companion, Ace, in <strong>Doctor Who</strong> in the 1980s. There&#8217;ll be some great scifi and fantasy authors there too, from fantasy authors Juliet McKenna (who wrote <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/08/15/the-representation-of-women-in-fantasy-what%E2%80%99s-the-problem-a-guest-post-by-author-juliet-e-mckenna/">this great post</a> for us on the representation of women in fantasy last year) and Mark Charan Newton, comics authors such as Paul Cornell and Dan Abnett, to sci-fi authors Jaine Fenn, Michael Cobley and China Miéville.</p>
<p>There are always great booths and an equally great programme of panel discussions, writing workshops, quizzes, and cosplay competitions, awards ceremonies such as the <a href="http://awards2012.sfx.co.uk/">SFX Awards</a> and <a href="http://www.thekitschies.com/">the Kitschies</a>, and a &#8216;Maskerade&#8217; party on the final night (DJed by <strong>Red Dwarf</strong>&#8216;s Craig Charles). All best enjoyed with some cold beer and some good geeky friends, of course.</p>
<h2>Sci-Fi Stage Adaptations</h2>
<p>Did you know <strong>The Ballad of Halo Jones</strong> had been adapted into a play? No, neither did I, but the Alan Moore story that&#8217;s been named as one of feminist website <a href="http://www.thefword.org.uk/shop/">The F Word&#8217;s recommended</a> comics and graphic novels was perfomed by Manchester-based production company <a href="http://scytheplays.blogspot.com/">Scytheplays</a> in early January.</p>
<p>We heard about this production via <a href="http://edfortune.wordpress.com/2012/01/02/the-ballad-of-halo-jones-the-stage-play/">this glowing review from Ed Fortune</a>. </p>
<blockquote><p>Halo and her friends live on the Hoop &#8211; a repository for the unemployed in the 50th century, but she won’t be beaten. She dreams of getting out and becomes a legend in the process.</p></blockquote>
<p>The current run is over now, but maybe they can be persuaded to go on tour? Comics writer Maura McHugh mentions her love of Halo Jones in an interview with BadRep <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/05/25/roisin-dubh-demons-and-bicycles-an-interview-with-author-maura-mchugh-part-one/">here.</a></p>
<p>We also found out recently that Cory Doctorow&#8217;s <a href="http://craphound.com/littlebrother/download/">revolutionary YA novel <strong>Little Brother</strong></a> has been adapted for the stage by <a href="http://www.custommade.org/">The Custom Made Theatre Co.</a>, though sadly this theatre happens to be in San Francisco, America, so I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve much chance of seeing that one&#8230;</p>
<p>Do you know of any other SF stage adaptations going on at the moment? Share them in the comments or <a href="mailto:badrepeditors@gmail.com">send them to the usual BadRep editors address!</a></p>

					<description><![CDATA[There's more to life than X Factor. Choose Who.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Doctor Who </strong> returns this Saturday for the second part of the sixth series it has enjoyed since re-launching in 2005. It&#8217;s a television programme that has inspired many &#8211; kids and adults alike &#8211; to a great deal of hoping, dreaming and far far greater fandom than they ever thought possible. It&#8217;s a show that escapes reality yet deals with the fantastic in a way that we can all relate to. And, yes, we&#8217;ve always liked it because of the crappy monsters and special effects. Whether or not you are a fan of the Doctor, you may now be wondering why he deserves a mention here. Well, let me tell you this&#8230;. I think that <strong>Doctor Who </strong>is very much a feminist show.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Doctor_Who_2010_title.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="7050" data-permalink="/2011/08/24/guest-post-doctor-who-feminist-icon/doctor_who_2010_title/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Doctor_Who_2010_title.jpg?fit=400%2C225&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="400,225" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Doctor_Who_2010_title" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Doctor_Who_2010_title.jpg?fit=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Doctor_Who_2010_title.jpg?fit=400%2C225&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7050" title="Doctor_Who_2010_title" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Doctor_Who_2010_title-300x168.jpg?resize=300%2C168" alt="Dr Who series 5 title card - on a cloudy orange background the show's title is picked out in metallic-look sci-fi style lettering. In the centre of the screen the letters DW are styled and perspectived to look like the box-shape of the Doctor's ship, the TARDIS. Image via Wikipedia, shared under Creative Commons" width="300" height="168" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Doctor_Who_2010_title.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Doctor_Who_2010_title.jpg?w=400&amp;ssl=1 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Although the Doctor has, so far, always been male and his companions are most often female, the gender of these characters are somewhat irrelevant when it comes to Getting Things Done. The Doctor is no James Bond or Indiana Jones. He uses intellect, banter and good old-fashioned running away rather than weapons, strength or bravado. In addition, there is nothing to say that regeneration could not leave our Time Lord resembling a human female in the future. This did happen when Joanna Lumley <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/joannalumley.jpg">briefly</a> played the part for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_and_the_Curse_of_Fatal_Death">Comic Relief spoof</a> in 1999, and there is often speculation about which female actor would be best to play the part.</p>
<p>Having relatively little knowledge of the many original series of <strong>Doctor Who</strong>, due to my poor memory and loss of interest around the Colin Baker era, I thought I&#8217;d ask a dedicated fan for a second opinion on this theory. Nick from book blog <a href="http://leaf-pile.blogspot.com/">A Pile of Leaves</a> agreed that I was right about the irrelevant gender of the characters. &#8220;Often the Doctor is a paternal or pedagogic figure, but he’s also depicted as fallible, flaky, eccentric, irascible. The first Doctor was told off quite a bit by his stern schoolteacher companion Barbara, the second Doctor was never as clever as astrophysicist Zoe, and the Fourth went around with a Time Lady for a while who was constantly correcting him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Doctor is simply a person, albeit an alien one, and so many of the usual tropes just won&#8217;t work here. He&#8217;s not &#8216;all knowing&#8217;, although he does a very good impression of that most of the time, and quite frequently he doesn&#8217;t have a plan. Most adventure stories have a hero who will always stay and fight, but the Doctor knows all too well when it&#8217;s time to simply give up and run away. Unlike most shows with a male and a female lead, none of the Doctors and companions have really had a romantic relationship until <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_Tyler">Rose Tyler</a>, somewhat controversially, declared her love for David Tennant&#8217;s Doctor. The companions are usually just someone to hang around with, adding an extra layer of excitement and preventing the boredom of travelling alone. Occasionally they know a fair bit more than he does too.</p>

When the character joined the show in 1973 she was added to give a topical splash of &#8216;Women&#8217;s Lib&#8217;, but it took a while for the writers to get the hang of exactly how best to do this. With the help of the actress who played her, the late <a href="http://io9.com/5793664/rip-elisabeth-sladen-doctor-whos-apprentice">Elisabeth Sladen</a>, in Tom Baker&#8217;s second series as the Doctor Sarah-Jane became a strong, independent character who often worked things out for herself. The writers started to give her some of the lines that had been written for the Doctor and she became more of an equal partner to him, staying on the show for longer than most companions and also returning in 2006 for another adventure. Only the best companions get their own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sarah_Jane_Adventures">spin-off show</a>, right?</p>
<p>Another excellent character who failed to conform to the annoyingly useless stereotype was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_(Doctor_Who)"><strong>Ace</strong></a>. Appearing right at the end of the original stretch of Doctor Who series in the 1980s, Ace, played by Sophie Aldred, had already learned to fend for herself on an alien planet before the Doctor even arrived and was far more tough than<a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/ace.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="7056" data-permalink="/2011/08/24/guest-post-doctor-who-feminist-icon/ace/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/ace.jpg?fit=274%2C380&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="274,380" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="ace" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/ace.jpg?fit=216%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/ace.jpg?fit=274%2C380&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-7056 alignright" title="ace" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/ace-216x300.jpg?resize=216%2C300" alt="Ace: a young caucasian woman wearing a black bomber jacket covered in patches and badges.

She battled the Daleks and the Cybermen, gaining confidence during her time in the TARDIS much like the brash Rose Tyler. These days, however, confidence is definitely not something that is lacking when it comes to female characters on the show. Since her arrival in 2010, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Pond"><strong>Amy Pond</strong></a> has always been stubborn, determined and rarely doubts her own abilities. Karen Gillan, who plays her, may have dismissed the idea that <a href="http://www.metro.co.uk/tv/831016-doctor-whos-karen-gillan-slams-sexy-amy-pond-critics">Amy is a feminist character</a>, but she most certainly has the ability to kick the patriarchy squarely in the balls. In contrast, her love-interest Rory is a caring and loyal nurse.</p>
<p>For anyone who likes their action-adventure stories to have a proper ballsy action hero, Doctor Who does now have one of those too. Of course, with this being Who, the character is no Jason Bourne. She was introduced in 2008 as a fearless professor and, due to also being a time traveller, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Song_(Doctor_Who)"><strong>River Song</strong></a> (Alex Kingston) not only knew the Doctor but had travelled with a future version of him, which meant that she now knew more than he did! River has seen and done enough to have a pretty good idea how to get out of most situations, and unlike the Doctor, she has no objection to using weapons to get her own way. Most definitely someone I would like to be around to help me out of trouble, but then again, so is the Doctor.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying that the programme fulfills every feminist want and need, as it&#8217;s still chock full of cliches and stereotypes in places, but this is a story where the parts could theoretically be played by anyone. River Song could be Nathan Fillion and the Doctor could be Helena Bonham Carter. How great would that be? In a Saturday night television schedule where little girls are shown that singing well and looking pretty can make you a star, isn&#8217;t it nice that they also have a show to watch where a gang of intergalactic misfits can win via the strategic application of a bit of thinking? There&#8217;s more to life than X Factor. Choose Who.</p>
<p><em><strong>Lori Smith </strong>is a rant-lite feminist who enjoys turning her thoughts into word form and then throwing them at the internet to see what sticks. She does this on a weekly basis for <a href="http://www.bitchbuzz.com/">BitchBuzz</a>, managed a bit at <a href="http://www.thefword.org.uk/archives/author/lorraine_smith">The F-Word</a> under her Sunday name and dumps the remaining stuff on her blog, <a href="http://www.lori-smith.co.uk/">Rarely Wears Lipstick</a>.</em></p>
