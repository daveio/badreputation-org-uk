					<description><![CDATA[If you remember the Alphabet of Feminism, this one's for you. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Ed&#8217;s note:</strong> In the original Alphabet we did <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/10/18/an-alphabet-of-femininism-3-c-is-for-crinoline/" target="_blank">&#8216;C is for Crinoline&#8217;</a> &#8211; but here&#8217;s something we thought was topically worth coming back to.</p>
<h6 style="text-align: center;">C</h6>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">CHIVALRY</h2>
<blockquote><p>Chivalry is dead, but you&#8217;re still kinda cute.</p>
<p>&#8211; Nelly Furtado, <strong>Promiscuous</strong> (2006)</p></blockquote>
<p>Chivalry. Not one of feminism&#8217;s most pressing issues, but definitely one of its more genteel <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/01/25/keep-the-gift-pay-what-you-owe/" target="_blank">debates</a>.</p>
<p>Do you, as an attractive female who also happens to be a feminist, deign to take the seat that dude offers you on the crowded tube or laugh hollowly and stick your head back in your neighbour&#8217;s armpit? Is chivalry OK?</p>
<p>Personally, my view on this debate is always affected by the point that 99% of the men I&#8217;ve met who talk about chivalry with misty-eyed fervour are also the kind of Nice Guys who Really Aren&#8217;t Very Nice At All.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not for here.</p>
<p>What I am interested in is looking at its complex linguistic heritage.</p>
<h2>Horses</h2>
<p>What&#8217;s that sound in the distance?</p>
<p>Why, it&#8217;s the sound of clopping hooves &#8211; and<em> chivalry</em>&#8216;s etymological root come to join us. Neiiigh.</p>

<p>For though <em>chivalry<strong> </strong></em>in English means (first definition ahoy!)  &#8216;the code of behaviour demonstrated<em> by a perfect knight</em>&#8216;, were we French we&#8217;d replace &#8216;knight&#8217; with &#8216;<em>chevalier</em>&#8216;, or &#8216;horseman&#8217; &#8211; from the root word <em>cheval</em> (= &#8216;horse&#8217;).</p>
<p>The knight, or <em>chevalier</em>, is <em> </em>in origin a nobleman on horseback who goes around rescuing maidens and fighting dragons. He is <em>chivalrous </em>in behaviour, displaying (the word&#8217;s second definition) &#8216;courage, honour, justice and readiness to help the weak&#8217;.</p>
<p>Key examples can be found in the legends of King Arthur and his horsebacked Knights of the Round Table &#8211; in particular Sir Gawain and the so-good-he-couldn&#8217;t-be-gooder Sir Percival (who later becomes Wagner&#8217;s <strong>Parsifal</strong>).</p>
<p>The chivalrous are those on horseback.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s the secondary meaning of <em>chivalry</em> that we best recognise today: &#8216;<em>courteous</em> behaviour, especially towards women&#8217; (that is, giving up your seat on the tube, which Percival would totally have done if he didn&#8217;t travel everywhere by <em>cheval</em>).<em> </em></p>
<h2>Courtly-powered lovin&#8217;</h2>
<p>Chivalry &#8211; and the <em>courtesy </em>that defines it &#8211; is also the base idea behind <em>courtly</em> <em>love</em>, which the devoted may remember we addressed separately in the <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/12/20/an-alphabet-of-femininism-12-l-is-for-lady/" target="_blank">Alphabet Glory Days</a>.</p>

<p>This is what the knights are doing when they&#8217;re not out fighting &#8211;  sighing for love among rose bushes, swooning at the touch of a <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/11/01/an-alphabet-of-femininism-5-e-is-for-emancipate/" target="_blank">&#8216;lily-white hand&#8217;</a> and <em>definitely </em>giving up their seats for a woman on the medieval commute.</p>
<p>And it was said to have been invented by a woman, Eleanor of Aquitaine.</p>
<p>Before she married Henry II and brought her French customs over to England, Eleanor had a period presiding alone over a predominantly male grouping in Poitiers.It seems inventing an elaborate code of chaste devotion to a single lady &#8211; <em>court</em>eous behaviour, if you will &#8211; was a good way for Eleanor to bring these bored and potentially restless knights into order &#8211; and, I assume, to block potential sexual aggression at the same time (cf. the court of Elizabeth I, which saw a resurgence of &#8216;courtly&#8217; devotion to &#8216;Gloriana&#8217;, the &#8216;Virgin <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/02/07/an-alphabet-of-femininism-17-q-is-for-queen/" target="_blank">Queen</a>&#8216;).</p>
<h2>Courtship</h2>
<p>With these courtly roots, it&#8217;s appropriate that, during the English Civil War, the word <em>chevalier </em>should lend itself so enthusiastically to the Royalist cause in fighting for king (and court).</p>
<p>In this context, the Cavaliers were enemies to the Roundheads and cousins to <em>chevaliers</em> via the Latin source-word &#8216;cabellarius&#8217; (also meaning &#8216;horseman&#8217;).</p>
<p>The origin of this term is actually pre-war, in the grouping of courtly &#8216;cavaliers&#8217; at the original Carolingian court (a bit like the courtly lovers at Poitiers).</p>
<p>These included the &#8216;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavalier_poet" target="_blank">Cavalier poets</a>&#8216;, a conglomerate of literary courtiers formed by the King himself, including Robert Herrick and Edmund Waller.</p>
<p>The term in this usage is ambiguous, though. On the one hand, <em>cavalier</em> was often used in allusion to the King&#8217;s refined (indeed &#8216;knightly&#8217;) sensibilities, which, incidentally, included a famous love of horses &#8211; as the many magnificent equestrian portraits of him attest.</p>
<p>But, in a pejorative sense, the <em>cavalier poets </em>were so named because they were famously &#8216;roistering gallants&#8217; and &#8216;libertines&#8217;. This is <em>cavalier</em>&#8216;s other meaning: &#8216;haughty, disdainful or supercilious&#8217; or &#8216;offhand and unceremonious&#8217; (a bit like wearing your hat at a<a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/02/14/an-alphabet-of-femininism-18-r-is-for-rake/" target="_blank"> &#8216;rakish&#8217; angle</a>).</p>
<p>So <em>cavalier </em>is almost a contraction in terms.</p>
<h2>The Don</h2>
<p>This is the very ambiguity we find in Mozart&#8217;s great libertine opera, <strong>Don Giovanni</strong>, written about 100 years later. The &#8216;Don&#8217; is a nobleman and serial womaniser. He&#8217;s a standard-issue<a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/02/14/an-alphabet-of-femininism-18-r-is-for-rake/" target="_blank"> rake</a>, in fact: we learn in the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fccdGBi9JUs&amp;t=2m30s" target="_blank">Catalogue Song</a> that he&#8217;s seduced 1,003 women in Spain alone.</p>

<p>He is throughout referred to in the Italian as a &#8216;cavalier&#8217;, understood (and, for us English-speakers, translated) according to context variously as &#8216;gentleman&#8217; (nobleman on horseback) and &#8216;rake&#8217; (careless womaniser) &#8211; as in the opera&#8217;s subtitle, &#8216;Il <em>dissoluto</em> punito&#8217; (&#8216;the debauchee punished&#8217;).</p>
<p>Thus, when Don Giovanni takes the pretty peasant girl Zerlina away from her finance, Masetto, to show her his castle (no, really), Don Giovanni &#8216;reassures&#8217; the jealous Masetto by saying he needn&#8217;t worry &#8211; his fiancee is &#8216;in the hands of a <em>cavalier</em>&#8216;.Unfortunately, that&#8217;s exactly what Masetto is afraid of. &#8220;Let the<em> cavaliere </em>make a <em>cavaliera</em> out of you!&#8221; he trumpets at the departing Zerlina &#8211; he knows what&#8217;s going down (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q40a23gfxZE" target="_blank">this</a>).</p>
<h2>Court to City</h2>
<p>Back to English climes.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the eighteenth century, Queen Anne halved the size of the English court and moved it out of central London.</p>
<p>In so doing, she ultimately ended up transferring power from court to city &#8211; and <em>courtesy </em>became <em></em>civility (from the Latin <em>cives</em> (= the city)).</p>

<p>This is the age of opening doors, watching your language and standing up when a woman enters the room. Chivalry has gone domestic; men are <em>civil </em>now in Britain. Only the hot-headed Italian Don Giovannis are still <em>cavaliers</em>.</p>
<p>But when Samuel Richardson wanted to depict a perfect (but domestic) Englishman, he still made him an aristocratic knight (<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sir</span> Charles Grandison</strong>). Jane Austen did too: her paragon of virtue (himself based on Sir Charles), is pointedly named Mr <em>Knightly</em> (<strong>Emma</strong>).By this point it&#8217;s faded away to a name rather than a title, but the gentleman still has a vestigial horse (if you will).</p>
<h2>White Knights</h2>
<p>Strangely enough, the vestigial horse becomes more literal in the modern age, in the form of the ladies&#8217; proverbial &#8216;ideal man&#8217; &#8211; a chivalrous gentleman. Mr Right is also a &#8216;knight in shining armour&#8217;.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s even a  Lewis Carroll-esque &#8216;White Knight&#8217;, a noble rescuer (as in the song &#8216;My White Knight&#8217; from Meredith Wilson&#8217;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_oyzwsJOhU" target="_blank"><strong>The Music Man</strong></a>, where the knight in question will, her mother thinks, &#8216;save&#8217; Marian the Librarian from Old Maidery).</p>
<p>Remember when Grace first meets Leo &#8211; the Great Romance &#8211; in <strong>Will and Grace</strong>? He&#8217;s on a horse in Central Park. That&#8217;s how you know he&#8217;s a Big Deal Romance.</p>
<h2>Never trust a man on horseback</h2>
<p>And, to conclude very crudely, I suppose this is what happened to <em>chivalry </em>.</p>
<p>It became the polite behaviour of the  gentleman &#8211; enshrined in tradition and developed over a couple of hundred years to become our friend offering me a seat on the bustling 21st century commute<strong> </strong>and sitcom single girls dreaming of their &#8216;Mr Darcy&#8217;.</p>
<p>But I still hear the sound of clopping hooves. The fantasy may be more Sir Gawain than Don Giovanni, but you know what they say &#8211; the apple never falls far from the lexical tree.</p>

Set in stone.</p></div>
<p>Let me introduce you to someone I didn&#8217;t know existed until a couple of weeks ago. Jael Boscawen. She was born Jael Godolphin in 1647, a revolutionary year in which King Charles I was captured by Cromwell,  the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levellers">Levellers</a> published their manifesto and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army">New Model Army</a> marched on London.</p>
<p>Challenging times. And a challenging lady, it seems.</p>
<p>Before we get down to details, the case for the defence.</p>
<p>Why is a bit of stone in a church and a woman long dead a relevant Found Feminism?</p>
<p>Well, it&#8217;s about history and culture. We know that there has been a problem with women in history &#8211; as in, there often don&#8217;t seem to be as good, or rich, or as many records for the ladies of the house as the menfolk. Despite it being almost certain that there were as many women in the past as men. There&#8217;s an underlying collective shoulder shrug of &#8220;well, that&#8217;s because women generally didn&#8217;t really ever do anything of any note.&#8221;  With the snide sidenote of &#8220;and generally never will&#8221;.</p>
<p>Which is sexism at its most toxic, and history at its most lazy.</p>
<p>When we do find written documentation about women like this one, it&#8217;s even more important and valuable to dive into it. Seeking out these women <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/category/history-is-awesome/">and their history</a> is part of the feminist project. Writing the <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/category/history-is-awesome/revolting-women-history-is-awesome/">history of women</a>, <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/category/history-is-awesome/unsung-heroes-history-is-awesome/">and telling it</a>, is part of that project too. The more women we can find from the past, the more confident we will be at reminding ourselves that being a woman does not confine you to being a helpmeet. Then or now.</p>
<p>This is especially true when the women are not quite what we might expect. And such is the case of Jael Godolphin.</p>
<p>What struck me about this plaque in particular is that it seems to be the only record I can find of her. She&#8217;s a mystery. A quick Google of her name <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=jael+boscawin&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&amp;client=firefox-a#hl=en&amp;sugexp=les%3B&amp;gs_nf=1&amp;tok=k_D9chqA4dUHXKyJdcPFsg&amp;pq=jael%20boscawin&amp;cp=12&amp;gs_id=os&amp;xhr=t&amp;q=jael+boscawen&amp;pf=p&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=RWs&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB%3Aofficial&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;oq=jael+boscawen&amp;gs_l=&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;fp=a9b3dc5f5b4e3582&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=706">doesn&#8217;t reveal an awful lot</a>. She doesn&#8217;t have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=Jael+Godolphin&amp;title=Special%3ASearch">Wikipedia page</a>. Her life, as far as we savvy internet creatures are concerned, was no life at all. She was born, she married, she had children, she died. The same bland story of so many women in the past, it seems.</p>
<p>Finding a history written in stone is significant because it indicates how important she must have been (this kind of dedication, with its prominent place by the church door, would not have been cheap). But more significant,  perhaps, is how she is described. The stereotypical view of a &#8220;good&#8221; woman from this time period would have her as a dutiful wife, daughter, mother, etc.</p>
<p>Not so with Jael Godolphin. The words written about her are about, well&#8230; <em>her.</em></p>
<blockquote><p>She was adorned with rare faculties of the mind, singular acuteness, sagacity and judgement, with a generous heart.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let&#8217;s be clear. There&#8217;s no prattle about how meek, mild and akin to the Virgin Mary she was. No, this woman from the 17th century is immortalised in an expensive chunk of stone, by people who loved and respected her for her mind. Her brain. Her ability to make decisions. To make good decisions, certainly &#8211; she had a kind heart, but the brain came first. Exactly the sort of text you might expect to see on the grave of a (male) patron.</p>
<p>Now this is the bit where it gets even better.</p>
<blockquote><p>Confessedly the ornament and at the same time the tacit reproach of a wicked Age.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not only was she smart, she was also complicated. I would add her to a fantasy dinner table guest list in a heartbeat, if only to be able to unpick that sentence. What does it mean? In my head she is an Elizabeth I figure, who used the perceptions of her gender to her advantage, self-aware and very canny. But all I have are these words. Not even a picture. However, given all the problems with women and images, perhaps these words are better?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to end on a shoutout for events such as <a href="http://www.nwhp.org/">National Women&#8217;s History Month</a> and resource gathering projects such as Wikipedia&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Women%27s_History">Women&#8217;s History</a>. This post was done with love, but not a lot of technical know-how on the whole history front. I stopped doing the subject at 14 when it became clear I was not getting much out of endless, collective-guilt-inducing rehashes of the bombing of Dresden. </p>
<p>If there are any historians out there  inspired by this and better at research than me, I&#8217;d love to know more about her.</p>
