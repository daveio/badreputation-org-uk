					<description><![CDATA[I bring you a short and sweet look at Torchlight 2 and some interesting developments re: Booth Babes.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First off, my apologies for being so late with this edition of Playing!  I work in a university, and the arrival of freshers and term starting again has made everything a little hectic. My secondary reason is that of the two new games I was playing in September, I <em>still</em> haven&#8217;t finished either, and I didn&#8217;t want to give half-prepared reviews.  However, as time drags on I feel I must bring you something!</p>
<p>So I bring you a short and sweet look at <strong>Torchlight 2 </strong> and some interesting developments re: Booth Babes.</p>
<p><a title="Torchlight 2 game" href="http://www.torchlight2game.com/" target="_blank">Torchlight 2</a> is an adventure RPG that has a slightly more cartoon-like presentation than big-budget rivals like <strong>Diablo III</strong>. Despite this, it&#8217;s been a huge success.  It allows a lot more freedom than <strong>D3</strong> does when levelling up your character with skill points, and there&#8217;s character points to spend where <em>you want</em>, not just automatically assigned.  There&#8217;s a great variety of skills to play with to suit your play style and your character.  I&#8217;m currently playing through as an <a title="Torchlight 2 Character Class: Engineer" href="http://www.torchlight2game.com/classes/engineer" target="_blank">Engineer</a>, and although long-range weaponry is an option I&#8217;m sticking with my two-handed melee weapons because I much prefer bashing my way through enemies.  That&#8217;s my example, but as I mentioned, I have yet to finish the game (or test the other classes out) so all I can do is advise you on what I know so far.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft" title="Screenshot from Torchlight II" src="https://i0.wp.com/static.cms.runicgames.com//assets/232/3_hollow012.png?resize=605%2C378" alt="" width="605" height="378" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>My favourite feature of the game is one&#8217;s pet.  There&#8217;s more choice in this game than the first as to what species of pet you have &#8211; I picked a ferret for the novelty &#8211; and being able to dump items in Professor Furzl&#8217;s inventory when mine is full is like a gift from the gods of gaming.  No longer shall you agonise over which rare item to pick up with only one space left in your backpack! Even better, you can send the pet to town with a bag full of junk, and he&#8217;ll return to you &#8211; wherever you are &#8211; with some lovely gold coins.  Best feature ever.</p>
<p>The final plus-side I&#8217;ll bring for you today is <strong>Torchlight 2</strong>&#8216;s price: £15/$20, which is half (or less) than what you&#8217;ll be paying for the big-budget, AAA+, giant developer titles (I think I paid £35 for Diablo 3 on release).  The smaller price doesn&#8217;t give you any less enjoyment, I&#8217;ve found.  It&#8217;s a great title with brilliant features, and comes in at a decent price.</p>
<h3>Now, a brief word on Booth Babes</h3>
<p> <br />
You probably know what I&#8217;m on about here; you go to a show or an expo, and the companies bring scantily clad women to sell their games.  It&#8217;s insulting to the gamers and there&#8217;s a lot of bad press about how these women are treated, too.  Well, as of next year&#8217;s show the Eurogamer Expo here in the UK will be <a title="Eurogamer Booth Babe Ban" href="http://www.eurogamer.net/forum/thread/242422" target="_blank">formally enforcing a ban on booth babes</a>.  Frankly, I am glad, but I fear that those people who really don&#8217;t get the message will still try and sell their games with <em>a little T&amp;A</em>.  We will have to see what happens next year, but from my point of view, and that of others I&#8217;ve spoken to on this topic, it&#8217;s a step in the right direction!</p>
<p>Hopefully by the next post I&#8217;ll have completed at least one playthrough with <strong>Borderlands 2</strong>&#8230; which, as I suspected it would be, is a secret feminist game.  More later!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[As promised, I actually played games this month!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As promised, I actually played games this month! I started off with <strong>Portal 2</strong>&#8216;s Perpetual Testing Initiative (which I mentioned <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/05/09/gamer-diary-what-ive-been-playing-april-2012/">last month</a>) I tried my hand at the Puzzle Maker to make <a title="Steam Workshop: Wvelkala" href="http://steamcommunity.com/id/wvelkala/myworkshopfiles/?appid=620" target="_blank">a few test chambers</a>.  You may notice from my efforts that I might, maybe, possibly, probably, harbour a teeny love of Deadly Goo.  Having attempted to use <strong>Valve</strong>&#8216;s <a title="Wikipedia: Valve Hammer Editor" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_Hammer_Editor" target="_blank">Hammer Editor</a> in the past to make maps for <strong>Portal 2</strong>, I can say that the new in-game Puzzle Maker is much simpler.</p>
<p>Obviously the simplicity has benefits as well as negative points: it&#8217;s simpler to use, so therefore more of the community can try their hand at map-making for an extremely popular title.  This is demonstrated by the fact that since the Puzzle Maker has been available, the number of<strong> <a title="Steam Workshop" href="http://steamcommunity.com/workshop" target="_blank">Steam Workshop</a></strong> files for <strong>Portal 2</strong> has shot up to nearly 100,000 (by comparison, <strong>Team Fortress 2</strong> has close to 5k and <strong>Skyrim</strong> just over 7k)<sup><a href="/2012/06/08/gamer-diary-what-ive-been-playing-may-2012/#footnote_0_11110" id="identifier_0_11110" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" as of 9am, 31.05.12 ">1</a></sup> despite being the newest edition to the Workshop repertoire.</p>
<div id="attachment_11122" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/mountainseamap.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11122" data-attachment-id="11122" data-permalink="/2012/06/08/gamer-diary-what-ive-been-playing-may-2012/mountainseamap/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/mountainseamap.jpg?fit=600%2C337&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="600,337" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="I am the Mountain, I am the Sea &#8211; Steam Workshop Portal 2 Test Chamber" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/mountainseamap.jpg?fit=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/mountainseamap.jpg?fit=600%2C337&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-11122" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/mountainseamap-300x168.jpg?resize=300%2C168" alt="Screenshot of a test chamber from Portal 2 by the author." width="300" height="168" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/mountainseamap.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/mountainseamap.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/mountainseamap.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-11122" class="wp-caption-text">My first test chamber for Portal 2</p></div>
<p>The negatives, I feel, come with the restrictions you face with what is available to you in the Puzzle Maker: e.g. you can&#8217;t add extra doors for staged testing.  Plus, try as I might to create things exactly as I imagine them in my head, it never seems to be quite right as not all the tools are available to you.  The solution here would be to learn how to use Hammer properly&#8230; but for a lot of fans that&#8217;s a bit too confusing to contemplate.</p>
<p>So, you may be wondering why my production of test chamber blueprints stopped mind-May&#8230; the answer is <strong>Diablo 3</strong>.  This hit internationally on May 15th and domestically (in the UK) May 18th.  After some very irritating cock-ups from various pre-order suppliers, I eventually got my hands on it for the UK release date.</p>
<p>I must say I&#8217;m sort of glad I didn&#8217;t get a copy until May 18th as Blizzard had some serious issues on the international release. Let me explore these. <strong>D3</strong> is both single and multiplayer but you <em>have to be online all the time, on Battle.net&#8217;s servers even to play on your own</em>.  No, it doesn&#8217;t make sense to me either.  Couple that with the fact that their servers clearly weren&#8217;t ready &#8211; nor capable &#8211; of handling the volume of people trying to connect.  Again, <em>just to play single player</em>.</p>
<p>Error 37 screengrabs were plastered all over the internet as eager fans were raging at Blizzard.  That&#8217;s not to say I didn&#8217;t escape: I&#8217;ve had three instances since I got the game where I&#8217;ve been unable to play because the damned servers were having a tea break (or eating themselves, I dunno) with Error 35 taking out the game on May 20th for over 9 hours and Error 37 rearing its ugly head again nearer the end of the month (<em>Error 35 = servers down for maintenance; Error 37 = servers are busy</em>).</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the one <strong>major</strong> drawback of the game.  The interwebs have been awash with rumours of an &#8220;offline mode&#8221;, but whether Blizz decide to actually do it or not only time will tell.</p>
<p>Enough of that.  The game itself is great fun with brilliantly detailed graphics and fun attacks for all classes.  This is the first RPG of this type (<a title="Wikipedia: Hand and Slash" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hack_and_slash" target="_blank">the hack&#8217;n&#8217;slash</a>) that I&#8217;ve actually finished &#8211; albeit only on normal difficulty &#8211; and am now going through it again to try and find better loot (so far unsuccessfully).  The fact that I haven&#8217;t got bored yet is praise in itself as I do have a tendency to just wander off despite all my intentions to play through as every class and on every difficulty.  Again, time will tell if I do end up admitting defeat.</p>
<p>Blizz have done OK with the female characters; yes, they start off fairly under-dressed but so do the male counterparts.  My one criticism is the fem-Demon Hunter&#8217;s boots&#8230; why would you wear heels (at all!) to fight the prime evil?  Seriously.  <em>Oh, and the occasional armour vs. cleavage fail is a given.</em></p>
<p>In between my battling of evil I made a brief foray into the world of the mod.  The mod in question is <strong><a title="Mod DB: Centralia" href="http://www.moddb.com/mods/centralia" target="_blank">Centralia: Part 1</a></strong>, which is the opening sequence of a game developed as a mod for <strong>Half Life 2: Episode 2</strong>.  I&#8217;ve written a more general review over <a title="The Talking Automaton: Centralia" href="http://thetalkingautomaton.wordpress.com/2012/05/30/centralia/" target="_blank">here</a> but I felt it worth a mention as <strong>a)</strong> it doesn&#8217;t involve shooting guns or killing things and<strong> b)</strong> yeah, OK, my brother is one of the devs.</p>
<p>The idea behind it is (I paraphrase) &#8220;to make creepy places fun&#8221;, so they&#8217;ve taken an extraordinary story from real life (<a title="Wikipedia: Centralia, PA" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centralia,_Pennsylvania" target="_blank">Centralia, PA</a>) and added some more spooky to the mix.  Even though it&#8217;s pretty short for now, it still managed to make me jump a couple of times.</p>
<div id="attachment_11123" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/outside_mock_v10051.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11123" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-11123" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/outside_mock_v10051-300x240.jpg?resize=300%2C240" alt="" width="300" height="240" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-11123" class="wp-caption-text">A still from the beginning of Centralia</p></div>
<p>It is a genuinely interesting concept for a game and I&#8217;d quite like to see where it goes, but to do that I first have to persuade my bro to set up a <strong>KickStarter</strong> fund, then he has to get funded through it.  <em>Blah, blah austerity etc.</em></p>
<h3>Tropes Vs Women in Games: a cool thing for you to throw money at</h3>
<p>As I&#8217;ve mentioned KickStarter, we here at BR had <a title="Kickstarter: Tropes vs Women in Games" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/566429325/tropes-vs-women-in-video-games" target="_blank">this </a>drawn to our attention.  <strong>Tropes vs. Women in Video Games</strong> is the brainchild of Anita of <strong><a title="Feminist Frequency" href="http://www.feministfrequency.com/" target="_blank">Feminist Frequency</a> </strong>who is hoping to make a series of films based on, well, tropes of women in video games.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;The series will highlight the larger reoccurring patterns and conventions used within the gaming industry rather than just focusing on the worst offenders.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe frameborder="0" height="360px" src="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/566429325/tropes-vs-women-in-video-games/widget/video.html" width="480px"></iframe></p>
<p>This looks promising, and who here <em>wouldn&#8217;t</em> want to get paid to play games and make films about it?  Exactly.</p>
<h3>Next Month:</h3>
<p>There will be <strong>Max Payne 3</strong> &#8211; as the PC edition got delayed so it didn&#8217;t have to do battle with Diablo 3 &#8211; and probably (<em>finally</em>) some<strong> AC: Revelations</strong> as I now have a copy waiting for me.  I suspect there will be more but I haven&#8217;t thought that far ahead yet!</p>
<h3>But! Before I go, an Assassin&#8217;s Creed note&#8230;</h3>
<p>Just quickly, <a title="Borderhouse Blog" href="http://borderhouseblog.com/?p=8511" target="_blank">this</a> has just popped up on the internet: promise of a female protagonist in an <strong>Assassin&#8217;s Creed</strong> title!  It will be a &#8220;companion game&#8221; to <strong>AC3</strong>, subtitled<strong><em> Liberation</em></strong>, but will only be on the PS Vita.  Borderhouse (follow the link) say:</p>
<blockquote><p>What’s interesting and exciting is that the protagonist of the game will be a woman of color named Aveline.</p></blockquote>
<p>Admittedly, yes, that is pretty interesting &#8211; and awesome &#8211; but being me I have to push the cynic buttons and raise two points. First, <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/03/13/gamer-diary-assassins-creed-3-reactions-roundtable/">we&#8217;ve talked about this before</a>, and I will keep banging on about it until it surfaces for definite: is this the &#8220;her&#8221; Juno mentioned at the end of Brotherhood?  This mysterious lady-assassin that Desmond has to find before he can defeat the Templars?  My guess is: no.  If it&#8217;s running concurrent to <strong>AC3</strong> he can&#8217;t have found her yet as, surely, her story comes <em>after</em> his ends (after another <strong>three games</strong>).</p>
<p>Secondly, PS Vita?  <em>Really?</em>  An over-expensive handheld with few titles and not nearly as many users as Xbox 360/Ps3/PC?  <em>That&#8217;s </em>where you decide to premiere your first femprotag of the franchise?  You don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s a little bit sidelining?  I suspect the peeps over at Ubisoft are expecting only the die hards to buy it, which means they aren&#8217;t too bothered about offering up a viable femprotag for the <em>mainstream </em>just yet.</p>
<p>Or, maybe they&#8217;re testing the waters for the Elusive Female Assassin that will save the world.  Or, maybe Aveline is &#8220;her&#8221;. Prove me wrong, Ubisoft, please!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Short answer?  Not a lot.  I find myself in the post-epic lull that tends to happen to me after I&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/04/18/gamer-diary-mass-effect-3/">powered through a great big game </a>all the way through &#8211; I end up just being a bit frazzled.  This has lasted longer than usual, possibly because I find myself in the odd position of having actually read a book.  That sounds much more self-condescending that it ought to: what I mean is that I am terrible at finishing books &#8211; there&#8217;s a good 10-20 half-read titles populating the shelves here.  This month however, I got through a whole one, from start to finish, but this may just have something to do with my new job (in a library).</p>
<p>Why am I babbling about books?  Because I&#8217;m trying to explain, as best I can, why I haven&#8217;t done much gaming this month.  Or, at least, not much that I can bring new content to you with.  There was some more <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/04/11/gamer-diary-what-ive-been-playing-march-2012/">Kinect</a> &#8211; my parents are better at the bowling game than I am &#8211; and some other little bits and pieces like a quick foray onto <a href="http://www.tf2.com/"><strong>Team Fortress 2</strong></a> to craft weapons and hats.</p>
<p>So, my apologies for the brevity of this post!  What I did play was <strong>Portal 2</strong>, on the &#8216;Play Day&#8217; that marked the one year anniversary of its release.  I thought it&#8217;d be a good thing to write about, so I did a Google and it turned out we (BadRep) are the <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/06/13/found-feminism-portal-2-and-saints-row-2-but-not-brink/">second result</a> when you search for &#8220;Portal 2 feminist&#8221;.</p>

<p>I also had a gander at that top link and presented my counter-argument over on my own blog <a title="The Talking Automaton: Portal 2" href="http://thetalkingautomaton.wordpress.com/2012/04/19/portal2/" target="_blank">here</a>, which some of you who follow us <a href="http://twitter.com/badrepuk">on Twitter</a> might have already seen.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t want to simply regurgitate what I&#8217;ve already written elsewhere all over BR, which is why this is such a short post, but if I may, I&#8217;ll show you what I&#8217;m excited for in the upcoming Gaming Future.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Portal 2</strong>: <a title="YouTube: Perpetual Testing Initiative" href="http://youtu.be/b7rZO2ACP3A" target="_blank">Aperture Perpetual Testing Initiative</a> &#8211; May 8th</li>
<li><strong>Diablo III</strong> &#8211; <a title="YouTube: Diablo III cinematic trailer" href="http://youtu.be/EgbUSsblCSQ" target="_blank">Finally being released</a>(!) and I&#8217;m looking forward to playing as some of those <a title="YouTube: Diablo 3 Demon Hunter Trailer" href="http://youtu.be/8scZZfU9Zh8" target="_blank">kick-ass looking fem-versions</a> <em>(apart from those stupid heels, ugh, seriously?!)</em> &#8211; May 15th (UK)</li>
<li><strong>Max Payne 3</strong> &#8211; More for the technology than the<em> (totally original &#8211; hurhur)</em> <a title="YouTube: Max Payne 3 Trailer #2" href="http://youtu.be/JTPRPr15sW0" target="_blank">damsel-in-distress</a> storyline &#8211; May 15th</li>
</ul>
<p>Later on, there&#8217;s also <a title="Borderlands 2 Launch Date Trailer" href="http://youtu.be/MCWJUSulnro" target="_blank"><strong>Borderlands 2</strong></a> which I&#8217;m looking forward to, and <a title="Crysis 3 trailer" href="http://youtu.be/g5NNkyDt65w" target="_blank"><strong>Crysis 3</strong></a> but I have to finish <strong>Crysis 2</strong> first &#8211; oops!  I&#8217;ll also endeavour to play something a bit less, er&#8230; shooty and more casual, for those of you out there who don&#8217;t really do the FPS thing.  Hopefully I&#8217;ll get some new tech over the summer to help on that front.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll also be writing up some interesting posts about humour and gender in games, and I might do some &#8216;case study&#8217; style posts on some of the prominent female characters out there.  I&#8217;ll do my best to bring you more exciting tales next month!</p>
