										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8216;Men aren&#8217;t attentive to girls who wear glasses&#8217; is Marilyn Monroe&#8217;s sober pronouncement at the end of 1953&#8217;s classic <strong>How to Marry a Millionaire</strong>. As the myopic Pola, she&#8217;s spent the whole of the film whipping off her glasses as soon as she gets a whiff of aftershave.</p>
<p>&#8216;Honestly Pola, why can&#8217;t you keep those cheaters on long enough to see who you&#8217;re with?&#8217; asks exasperated gal pal Lauren Bacall, to which Pola replies:</p>
<p>&#8216;Oh no, I&#8217;m not taking a chance like that! You know what they say about girls who wear glasses.&#8217;</p>
<p>Apparently &#8211; according to a <a href="http://www.selectspecs.com/blog/the-sexy-librarian-look/">single and slightly biased internet source</a> &#8211; this wasn&#8217;t a million miles away from Monroe herself, who was &#8216;nearsighted and often wore glasses at times when she was out of the limelight&#8217;. If we believe this Fun Fact, its absence from the public domain underscores the irony. You know what they say about girls who wear glasses.</p>
<h3>Got To Put My Cheaters On!</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve got a lot of sympathy for poor Pola-Marilyn. I’ve had moderate to severe myopia since primary school, and spent a large portion of my teenage years bumping into things and hugging strangers out of a misguided desire to be considered attractive by the Average Teenage Boy.</p>

<p>To be fair, I am unluckily one of those people for whom glasses do not automatically provide a sense of <a href="http://www.spectaclesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/tom-ford-eyewear-girl-in-spectacles.jpg">insouciant high-end Tom Ford cool</a> &#8211; all the angles of my face are fattened and distorted with a bad pair of frames. And the laws of statistics and dubious teenage taste dictate that most longstanding myopics will choose a bad pair of frames several times over the course of their younger lives before alighting on the style that works for them. (I&#8217;ve always considered it very mean that the average glasses model can be selected for her <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--AyaO55wAIE/TZXLZUogRJI/AAAAAAAAAKk/ppfI9pDi8hQ/s1600/gokwan.jpeg">glasses-friendly angles</a>, whereas Real Life distributes myopia and astigmatism with no such aesthetic consideration. But lol fashion industry / real womenz / shocker.)</p>

<p>To bring the sob story towards a conclusion: I got contact lenses for my sixteenth birthday, wore them every hour of consciousness (to the long-term detriment of my ocular health), got a few erosions, corneal scars and whatnot due to excessive wear, finally accepted I needed a good pair of glasses and recently found the pair of frames I like with the help of a <a href="http://www.spexinthecity.com/">critical and dedicated sales assistant and a significant wad of cash</a>. I objectively like my glasses nowadays. But I still don&#8217;t wear them if I can help it.</p>
<p>Yes, I know. What.</p>
<h3>Eyes Wide Shut</h3>
<p>I have a literary precursor as far back as George Eliot, whose short-sighted Dorothea Brooke misses part of the plot of <strong>Middlemarch</strong>, by being ‘aware that there was a gentleman standing at a distance, but see[ing] him merely as a coated figure at a wide angle’. For Dorothea, the sights of Rome on her honeymoon are like &#8216;a disease of the retina&#8217;. <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080330174023AAKtsqW">On faut souffrir pour être belle</a>, non?</p>
<p>Indeed, you certainly don&#8217;t see many glasses on women pre-1950 or thereabouts, although they&#8217;ve <a href="http://myenvisioneyecare.wordpress.com/2010/08/04/interesting-eyewear-through-the-ages/#">been around for a while</a>. While part of this is undoubtedly an expense issue, pre-Nye Bevan and the <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/imgres?q=john+lennon&amp;num=10&amp;um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;biw=1130&amp;bih=615&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=h0haLXlnQczkzM:&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.johnlennon.com/&amp;docid=bWxLK1RkU-ggyM&amp;imgurl=http://www.johnlennon.com/wp-content/themes/jl/images/home-gallery/2.jpg&amp;w=1015&amp;h=1014&amp;ei=uYUDT-_QPIuA8gObtr2IBw&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=hc&amp;vpx=85&amp;vpy=162&amp;dur=271&amp;hovh=224&amp;hovw=225&amp;tx=94&amp;ty=125&amp;sig=118044106381756447403&amp;sqi=2&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=117&amp;tbnw=114&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=24&amp;ved=1t:429,r:0,s:0">NHS &#8216;John Lennon&#8217; frames</a>, and in the age of the Sherlock Holmesian &#8216;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventure_of_the_Golden_Pince-Nez">gold pince-nez</a>&#8216;, I think it was an aesthetic thing too. It&#8217;s significant that once bespectacled women start to appear in film and books they are generally working, or practical, women: <a href="http://www.wearysloth.com/Gallery/ActorsB/1262-20572.gif">Midge</a> in Hitchcock&#8217;s <strong>Vertigo</strong>, who is opposed to the mysterious Madeleine Elster, a lady of leisure; the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m11arA5LXGk">(sexy) secretary / librarian trope</a>; the Plain Jane in need of a makeover and the woman who’s really very intelligent but not very sexy – the one you have to really look at closely to realise &#8211; gosh! &#8211; she looks like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2_GpTWDL3o">Kate Winslet</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8216;Do you know? &#8211; without your glasses, you don&#8217;t look half bad.&#8217;<br />
&#8216;Do you know? &#8211; without my glasses, nor do you.&#8217;</p>
<p>Kate Winslet in <strong>Enigma</strong> (2001)</p></blockquote>
<p>These last are very much about glasses as a cover-up for something more exciting (whence, I assume, the provenance of the sexy secretary&#8217;s appeal). In another Marilyn Monroe film, <strong>The Seven Year Itch</strong>, the protagonist imagines his secretary throwing off her (tailored) jacket, throwing out her hair and losing the glasses, to reveal &#8216;I&#8217;m a woman! I&#8217;m flesh and blood!&#8217;. In much the same way, any unattractive high school social outcast has but to throw off their frames to reveal a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3r2Ih1-mVs">Rachel Leigh Cook</a> or an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUjlBP5gUrQ">Anne Hathaway</a>. Glasses, a synonym for intelligence and mystery, are the first things to discard when you want to seduce the hottest guy in school, trust.</p>

<p>Of course, the popularity of pre-makeover glasses &#8211; and their enduring use in teen films &#8211; is partly practical. Glasses are the easiest way to disguise a Hollywood beauty, and an instantly recognisable trope for your basic socially inept personality traits: &#8216;brains&#8217;, &#8216;practicality&#8217; etc. But as a teenager you’re inevitably subjected to a series of little humiliations and embarrassments that go on to dog you, to a greater or lesser extent, for a large part of your adult life. As a girl growing up behind a pair of glasses, and steeped in the standard adolescent amount of ideological nonsense, you cannot but associate all that tedious baggage (&#8216;I&#8217;m unattractive! I&#8217;m awkward! Nobody fancies me!&#8217;) with the teenage glasses, and shedding it with embracing contact lenses.</p>
<p>Indeed, it even seems to be a kind of ironic (and slightly obnoxious) appropriation of these ideas <a href="http://www.selectspecs.com/blog/get-your-glasses-on-for-valentine%E2%80%99s-day-%E2%80%93-specs-are-sexy/">when, conversely, glasses are deemed &#8216;sexy&#8217;</a> in themselves. One slightly palm-sweating blog in this vein compares them to garters &#8211; &#8216;men want to take them off [the woman wearing them]&#8217;, except more <a href="http://www.selectspecs.com/blog/the-sexy-librarian-look/"> fetishy</a>. Personally, I just wear them cos I like &#8230;seeing.</p>
<h3>Glasses-wearer By Day, Superhero By Night</h3>
<p>This is not just one for the girls &#8211; before he discovered the famous NHS frames, a very image-aware (but severely myopic) John Lennon refused to wear glasses when playing live, making him a Beatle who didn&#8217;t actually <em>see</em> the Cavern Club. But, by and large, men in glasses seem to have had an easier ride: the counterpart to the &#8216;sexy secretary&#8217; is, rather unfairly, the Clark Kent / Peter Parker paradigm, or rather, &#8216;glasses-wearer by day, superhero by night&#8217;. Compare this to the excellent typist who ditches the glasses only to show her employer that, actually, she <span style="text-decoration: underline;">does</span> enjoy sex (hmmm&#8230; enjoying sex / saving the world&#8230;).</p>
<p>Moreover, the weakness myopia is seen to connote in men is generally considered more attractive than the dowdiness it suggests in women &#8211; &#8216;You don&#8217;t think they make me look like an old maid?&#8217; worries Marilyn-Pola, through her Dame Ednas, as does Bette Davis pre-makeover in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6KD7DATyj0"><strong>Now, Voyager</strong></a> (1942) &#8211; and millionaire-seeking once again in <strong>Some Like It Hot</strong>, Marilyn hopes ‘her’ man will have glasses. ‘Men who wear glasses are so much more gentle, sweet and helpless’, she says. Indeed, there&#8217;s even a sense here that a man with glasses becomes less frightening or powerful, less brashly &#8216;male&#8217;. The only disadvantage for Marilyn is that when she kisses the one she finds, his glasses steam up.</p>
<p>But perhaps she has something when, in <strong>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes</strong> she asserts to her (bespectacled) groom’s disapproving father – who sees right through her gold-digging tricks &#8211; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9glKchxU3I&amp;t=5m30s">‘Don’t you know that a man being rich is like a woman being pretty? You wouldn’t marry a woman just because she’s pretty but, my goodness, doesn’t it help?!’</a>.  If a woman’s face is her fortune, best not to cover it with glasses, eh?</p>
<p>But actually, I think the time has come to take that as exactly the nonsense it is. Seeing is sexy. Wear your glasses with pride.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A spectre is haunting London. My daily commute, never a joyful affair, has recently been lent a further dimension of irritation by adverts on buses, hoving into view with tedious regularity, bearing the image of <strong>Meryl Streep</strong> dolled up as Mrs Thatcher in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1007029/"><strong>The Iron Lady</strong></a>. Thirty years on from Thatcher&#8217;s rise to power, and after a minor rash of small-screen depictions – Andrea Riseborough in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1067578/"><strong>The Long Walk to Finchley</strong></a>, Lindsay Duncan in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1230150/"><strong>Margaret</strong></a> &#8211; Streep will now portray her on the big screen, the prospect of which I could have happily lived without.</p>
<p>Having as I do <a href="http://velvetcoalmine.wordpress.com/2011/09/19/the-pits-and-the-pendulum/">firsthand experience</a> of the impact of Thatcher’s thirteen years, her government’s break with prevailing consensus and bloody-minded devotion to neoliberal orthodoxies, an objective and rational evaluation of the woman is probably beyond me. That said, her presumably impending death &#8211; although I do have a longstanding appointment at a pub in King&#8217;s Cross to dutifully raise a glass &#8211; is something to which I&#8217;ll be largely indifferent. It won&#8217;t matter. Thatcher as a person has far less bearing on the current world than what she represents. The damage has been done, the battle lost, and much as I might appreciate a Truth and Reconciliation Commission into the 1980s, Thatcher and her co-conspirators are by now <a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/steven-baxter/2011/12/decisions-away-information">too old and whiskey-soaked</a> to be held to any meaningful account.</p>
<p>Efforts to humanise Thatcher, even when they enlist Meryl Streep, seem discomfiting and deeply bizarre. What she means has transcended what she was, is and will be. The purpose of this post, therefore, apart from being an exercise in detachment for me, is to look briefly at some aspects of Thatcher’s image in political and pop culture, and to consider the effect of her gender on her role as a woman in power. Quick, before the next bus goes past.</p>
<h3>The Icon Lady</h3>
<blockquote><p>Meanings of all kinds flow through the figures of women, and they often do not include who she herself is.</p>
<p>&#8211; Marina Warner, <strong>Monuments and Maidens</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Thatcher’s visual staying power in political and pop culture is as great as her impact on <a href="http://johnrobb77.wordpress.com/2009/06/16/how-margaret-thatcher-changed-pop-culture-for-ever/">oppositional music</a>. The face of Thatcher most often called to mind is that of what Angela Carter termed her ‘balefully iconic’ post-1983 premiership: encased in true-blue power suits, wielding a handbag, her hair lacquered into immobile submission, her earlier style solidified into a heavily stylized femininity bordering on drag. Paul Flynn, in a <a href="http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/paul_flynn/2006/05/by_paul_flynn.html">fairly tortured discussion</a> of Thatcher’s status as a gay icon, put it down to her ‘ability to carry a strong, identifiable, signature look&#8230; an intrinsic and steely power to self-transform’, and a ‘camp, easily cartooned presence’. The startling evocative power of this look, its ability to summon up its host of contemporary social, cultural and political associations, is why I jump when Streep&#8217;s replication of it intrudes into my vision. It’s like being repeatedly sideswiped by the 1980s, which is something the last UK election had already made me thoroughly sick of.</p>

The artist Alison Jackson <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/feb/11/margaret-thatcher-meryl-streep-photograph">observes</a> that all three &#8216;had what it takes to become a modern icon: big hair, high foreheads and a face that would allow you to project your own fears and desires on to it.&#8217; Conversely, subsequent political leaders &#8211; including both <a href="http://cvcl.mit.edu/hybrid_gallery/tatcher_blair.html">Blair</a> and <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_OVzuV6XUReA/TJ0EjTQ29WI/AAAAAAAAARU/SOy8bXxatls/s1600/Cameron-Thatcher.png">Cameron</a> &#8211; have had their own faces conflated with Thatcher’s, usually as part of left-wing critiques meant to signify the closeness of their policies to hers. Thatcher’s image is here used as an instantly recognisable political signifier, communicating a set of ideological ideas in a single package, as well as a self-contained political warning sign.</p>
<p>Although the kind of passive objectification associated with Monroe might seem at odds with the idea of Thatcher as a great historical actor with narrative agency in her own right, the images of both women are used in a cultural tradition in which the female figure in particular becomes a canvas for the expression of abstract ideas (think justice, liberty, victory). The abstract embodiment of multiple meanings, and the strategic performance of traditional ideas of femininity, constitute sources of power which Thatcher and her political and media allies exploited to the hilt in their harnessing of support for the policies she promoted.</p>
<h3>Iron Maidens</h3>
<p>Thatcher’s image, rather than appealing solely to a particular aspect of femininity, was a tense mixture of conflicting and mutually reinforcing signifiers. Angela Carter <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/46831407/Angela-Carter-Shaking-a-Leg">identified</a> it as a composite of feminine archetypes, including <strong>Dynasty</strong>’s Alexis Carrington, Elizabeth I as Gloriana, Countess Dracula, and one of PG Wodehouse’s aunts – tropes sharing a certain type of burlesqued and grotesque dragon-femininity. The 1981 Falklands conflict allowed the discourse around Thatcher to reference the precedents of both Queen Victoria and Churchill, and she was photographed on a tank in an <a href="http://iconicphotos.wordpress.com/2009/04/23/thatcher-in-a-tank/">image</a> that the <strong>Daily Telegraph</strong> described as ‘a cross between Isadora Duncan and Lawrence of Arabia’.</p>
<p>Justine Picardie, in a <a href="http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/article/TMG8940986/The-Making-of-The-Iron-Ladys-Wardrobe.html">grimly fascinating read</a>, roots Thatcher’s style in the rigid grooming of well-turned-out 1950s femininity in general and her sartorially plain Methodist upbringing in particular:</p>
<blockquote><p>Interviewed by Dr Miriam Stoppard for Yorkshire Television in 1985, she gave a glimpse of a childhood desire for the luxury of colour, and shop-bought extravagance, whether a new dress or sofa cover: &#8216;that was a great expenditure and a great event. So you went out to choose them, and you chose something that looked really rather lovely, something light with flowers on it. My mother: &#8220;That&#8217;s not serviceable.&#8221; And how I longed for the time when I could buy things that were not serviceable.&#8217;</p></blockquote>
<p>Even at the height of her political power, she chose to retain the ‘pretty’ and ‘softening’ effects of her trademark <a href="http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/galleries/TMG8946898/Margaret-Thatchers-style-over-the-years.html">horrible bows</a>. Alongside this tendency towards aspirational frivolity, she cultivated connotations of the provincial housewife – a ‘Housewife Superstar’ – wearing an apron while on the campaign trail and being shown washing dishes while contesting the party leadership. </p>
<p>Her ‘Iron Lady’ speech distinctly echoed the ‘body of a weak and feeble woman&#8230; heart and stomach of a king’ construction <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_to_the_Troops_at_Tilbury">associated with Elizabeth I</a> in its drawing on the tension between conflicting signifiers:</p>
<blockquote><p>I stand before you tonight in my Red Star chiffon evening gown, my face softly made up and my fair hair gently waved, the Iron Lady of the Western World. A cold war warrior, an Amazon philistine, even a Peking plotter. Well, am I any of those things? Yes&#8230; Yes, I am an iron lady, after all it wasn&#8217;t a bad thing to be an iron duke.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Not a Man to Match Her?</h3>
<p>Thatcher&#8217;s courting of various feminine roles did not prevent the assigning of masculine attributes to her – notably in oppositional parodies and satire. Her iconic <strong>Spitting Image</strong> puppet was shown wearing a suit and tie and smoking a cigar, addressed as &#8216;Sir&#8217;, and given a more or less explicit emasculating effect upon male colleagues and political opponents:</p>
<p><iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/OyU8qmzGsEg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Outside satire, the 1984 Miners&#8217; Strike has been conceptualised both as a <a href="http://deathatthemall.wordpress.com/2011/12/16/men-at-war-mark-simpson-examines-masculinity-and-the-miners-strike/">mass emasculation</a> of ordinary male miners <em>and</em> an overt bout of cock-duelling between Thatcher and miners&#8217; leader Arthur Scargill, each of whom were criticised for an absolutist and stubbornly Napoleonic approach to the conflict rather than a more ‘feminine’ openness to negotiation and compromise.</p>
<p>As Dawn Fowler <a href="http://eprints.uwe.ac.uk/7817/">notes</a> in her consideration of dramatic treatments of the Falklands War, a problem with such portrayals of Thatcher is that she &#8216;can be represented as simply denying her true feminine self in favour of a crazed fascist agenda.&#8217; <strong>The Comic Strip</strong>’s <a href="http://gaffa.org/dreaming/glc.html">satirical take</a> on Thatcher’s battles with Ken Livingstone and the Greater London Council presented her as the victim of alien or demonic possession, the ending of which left her soft and passive – restored to her presumably appropriate, natural form. Both applauding Thatcher for her ability to overcome &#8216;traditional&#8217; feminine weakness and irrationality and behave symbolically as a man, and castigating her for her failure or suppression of a &#8216;true&#8217; soft and accommodating female nature, are equally dubious in the qualities they seek to assign to &#8216;real&#8217; women.</p>
<blockquote><p>Thatcher was repeatedly likened to a female impersonator, a man in blue dresses. The reason for this is simple, and apparently shatterproof: we have so firmly linked power and masculinity that we think a powerful woman is a category error. Instead of changing our ideas about power, we change the sex of a powerful woman. </p>
<p>&#8211; <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2011/dec/09/marilyn-monroe-margaret-thatcher-biopics"><strong>Sarah Churchwell</strong></a></p></blockquote>
<h3>No Job for a Lady?</h3>
<p>While Thatcher’s election to Prime Minister was of course a landmark for women in politics, her much-vaunted &#8216;grocer&#8217;s daughter&#8217; outsider status was mediated through an Oxford education and marriage into wealth. The number of prominent women serving as MPs and Cabinet ministers prior to or alongside Thatcher &#8211; Nancy Astor, Margaret Bondfield, Betty Harvie Anderson, Jenny Lee, Barbara Castle to name a few – make her ascension exceptional but not unique. Nor should Thatcher’s progress in the male-dominated world of British politics obscure how little she actually did for women once in office: the lack of women appointed to ministerial positions; her disparaging of ‘strident Women’s Libbers’; her invariably male ideological protégés. Historian Helen Castor, <a href="http://thebrowser.com/interviews/helen-castor-on-queens-and-power?page=3">discussing</a> the ‘extraordinary’ parallels between the iconography of Thatcher and that of Elizabeth I, points out that both women emphasised themselves as the exception to a rule:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;what those two women both did was not say, Women can rule, women can hold power. They both said, Yes, OK, most women are pretty feeble, but I am a special woman.</p></blockquote>
<p>At a point where Thatcher’s chosen ideology is resulting in <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/the-womens-blog-with-jane-martinson/2011/oct/05/womens-dwindling-support-for-cameron">falling standards of living</a> for women &#8211; and men &#8211; across Britain; where the dim and insubstantial <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3252FSW7OC4">Louise Mensch</a> can manage to position herself as a rising star, and where the Home Secretary’s political decisions make fewer headlines than her choice of shoe, I’m relieved to see that attempts to rehabilitate Thatcher as any kind of feminist icon are largely <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-derbyshire-16438897">being </a><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/the-womens-blog-with-jane-martinson/2012/jan/05/margaret-thatcher-feminist-icon?INTCMP=SRCH">resisted</a>. It remains to be seen whether <strong>The Iron Lady</strong>, and its fallout in the form of frankly offensive Thatcher-inspired <a href="http://www.graziadaily.co.uk/fashion/archive/2011/08/11/holy-handbags-batgirl-its-georgia-may-thatcher.htm">fashion shoots</a>, means that her image is now undergoing a further transcendence into the realms of irony and kitsch (as has happened with both Marilyn and Che), or whether this is part of a conscious revival of the political associations her image originally carried and to which we are being returned – conditions profoundly unfriendly to female independence and agency despite the women occasionally employed as their shock troops.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[She deserves a better class of memorialist.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/CajpSeUvCPY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amywinehouse.com/" target="_blank">Amy Winehouse</a>, for all the typically Machiavellian marketing behind her early development and signing, was an atypical star to launch, even before the drink, drugs, bisexuality, tattoos and self-harm and sprawling domestic disharmony on the streets of Camden set in. 2003 was a year of slickly manufactured, crowdpleasing pop anthems spawned by reality tv or established industry hit machines: Britney, Christina, Avril, Beyoncé, Sugababes, Rachel Stevens, Girls Aloud. In this climate, Winehouse&#8217;s debut <strong>Frank</strong>, an engagingly personal and subtly powerful blend of jazz, soul, dub and heavy drinking, stood out as an album of grit among gloss, accomplished and ambitious, recalling the eclectic and impeccably imperious style of Dinah Washington and Nina Simone.</p>
<p>Equally, despite her status as a product of the Sylvia Young and Brit stage schools, Winehouse was hardly manufactured, having been a genuinely talented singer, guitarist and songwriter from a young age. The lyrics she produced and her delivery of them were cool, critical and cynical – <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVaqQe3V498" target="_blank">&#8216;Fuck Me Pumps&#8217;</a> is a punchily sung and scathing dismissal of the dominant gold-digging paradigm. Her definitive, self-mythologising single <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LTPRJqt2z4" target="_blank">&#8216;Rehab&#8217;</a>, despite its refrain&#8217;s predictable propensity to generate tasteless jokes and mawkish headlines in the wake of her death, is a staggering song of self-awareness, wiped clean of messy emoting or self-pity and resolutely swerving any courting of sorrow or sympathy. Its protagonist does not bewail her fate in the clasp of addiction but makes her refusal to be pathologised an active and empowering choice – &#8216;no, no, no&#8217; means no. Like much of Winehouse&#8217;s material, the song addresses and analyses addiction, dependency, depression and the complexities of female independence with a wry, arch, clear-eyed and mocking wit that could have leavened the weight of many a confessional memoir.</p>
<p>To evaluate Winehouse&#8217;s career as a story of potential unfulfilled, as many obituaries are doing, is to ignore the quality of second album <strong>Back to Black</strong>, with its clutch of BRITs, Grammys and Ivor Novellos, as well as the sheer depth of its influence. Winehouse&#8217;s international success began a scramble by record companies to scrounge up similar eclectic and experimental female artists. It is perhaps unfortunate that all this process actually got us was an indistinguishable female-centred quirk-quake comprised of <a href="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article6725104.ece" target="_blank">Little Pixie Roux and the Machine for Lashes</a>, as well as current favourites Adele and Duffy – both well-behaved, clean and immaculately blue-eyed biters of a vintage musical style which Winehouse had almost singlehandedly reinvigorated. For all their undoubted technical ability, such singers purvey blandly perfect reproductions of retro soul, whereas Winehouse was able to inhabit past musical modes like she wore her Ronettes-inspired beehive, investing them with something contemporary and compelling through that awesome, syrupy, rolling contralto. Her aesthetic – glamorously grubby, leonine and Cleopatra-eyed – was similarly inimitable and atypical. Even Lady Gaga <a href="http://www.popeater.com/2009/03/16/lady-gaga-loves-strange-girls-like-amy-winehouse/" target="_blank">credited </a>Winehouse with smoothing the path to mainstream success for other &#8216;strange girls&#8217;.</p>
<p>The tributes to Amy Winehouse clotting the front pages this past weekend reflect the other aspect of her fame: the purpose she served as media cipher. The narrative into which she was coralled – discovered, lauded, rewarded, exploited, drug-ravaged and wrung dry by the cynics and sycophants around her – is a traditional trajectory for women in the public eye, from Marilyn to Britney. Mixed in with the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/may/06/amy-winehouse-jean-rhys-addiction" target="_blank">clichés </a>of the demon-driven artist, Winehouse&#8217;s dedication to the life of a good-time girl provided an obvious temptation for the press to shoehorn the shapeless and slippery business of living into a rigid mould of Meaning, to make her a signifier of the plagues afflicting modern womanhood &#8211; not all of modern womanhood, of course, just those of us susceptible to the lure of urban independence and its giddy, glittering thrills.</p>
<p>There is an obvious irony in the fact that the media&#8217;s very concentration on her as a reliably scandalous page-filler embedded her in public consciousness as not an artist but a cautionary tale of misjudged relationships and worse-judged substance indulgence, eliciting a weird and volatile mixture of compassion and contempt. There was, too, a ghoulish and lascivious edge to public concern over Winehouse &#8211; as there was, back in the day, over Courtney Love and, latterly, Britney Spears &#8211; which is seldom present in attitudes to their male counterparts. The same organs which engorged themselves with pictures of Winehouse in her various stages of decline, distress and debauchery are continuing to objectify and sensationalise her as, inevitably, a &#8216;brilliant but troubled&#8217; combination of tragic loss and dreadful warning. She deserves a better class of memorialist.</p>
