										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was very worried about this film, having watched <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHBnrJowBZE">the trailer</a> and become fearful that it might go the way of the <strong>Hulk</strong> franchise. It had a similar feel to it &#8211; lots of rippling muscles and anger with cars being thrown around.</p>
<p>I am pleased to say that I was wrong. And <strong>Thor</strong> is, in fact, awesome. In all ways. Although especially in the way that <strong>Chris Hemsworth</strong> is jaw-droppingly attractive and takes his shirt off for extended periods. Also his biceps appear to be gearing up to eat Tokyo. And there&#8217;s <em>mud wrestling</em>.</p>

<p>Now, when I tell you the plot you&#8217;ll tell me that I have gone mad for liking it, and that I was blinded by the sight of such a perfect male specimen. In my defence, this is an actor cast to play Thor, so he needs to be at least a bit buff.</p>
<p>Bear with me.</p>
<p>The<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesir"> Aesir</a> here are basically alien-space royalty and live on this beautiful world with crystal palaces and epic science/magic. The rainbow bridge (guarded by Heimdall, played by the brilliant-in-everything <strong>Idris Elba</strong>) allows them to blast their way to other planets. Using the argument that any sufficiently advanced science is indistinguishable from magic, they are worshipped as gods by the primitive Vikings.</p>
<p>Thus when a chap falls to earth (landing in a small town somewhere in the sandy <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=square+states">square states</a>) and proclaims himself Thor, everyone thinks he&#8217;s a bit mad. Especially when the rampaging starts. However, some handy scientists need him for some handy science, and then there&#8217;s this hammer that no-one can lift&#8230;</p>
<p>This all had the potential to be cringingly awful and cheesy, but fortunately it was handled in a rarely-seen triumphal triumvirate of sensitive and nuanced acting, balanced direction (<strong>Kenneth Branagh</strong> at the helm, and he&#8217;s a man who can deal with a lot of ham) and a script that focused on that shyest of all beasts in the comic book action genre: character development.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s right. Character development. Get in.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Hopkins</strong>, who plays Odin, is <a href="http://splashpage.mtv.com/2010/02/09/exclusive-anthony-hopkins-talks-thor-says-thou-shalt-not-hear-shakespearean-talk/">seen here in an interview</a> calling Thor &#8220;a superhero film with a bit of Shakespeare in&#8221;, which is a good summary. The almost unbelieveable plot is rescued from itself by the way in which it allows characters to grow.</p>
<p>I was very happy that the writers had chosen to riff heavily from <strong>Mark Millar</strong>&#8216;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Thor"><strong>Ultimate Thor</strong></a> rewrites, in which Thor is styled as a hero struggling with self-doubt and the agony of everyone thinking that he&#8217;s actually suffering from delusions that make him think he&#8217;s a god.</p>
<p>In the film, Thor gets kicked out of Valhalla by Odin for being an annoying, spoilt teenager who picks fights and starts wars. He needs to make good and get some responsibility.</p>
<p>We follow Thor on his journey from arrogant, angry young man to being, well, a grown up. His essential good-naturedness and charm, as well as obvious desire to do good, make this neither pat nor schmaltzy, but wholly believable, and at times exceptionally moving.</p>
<p>In the meantime, his brother Loki is also trying to find himself. Rather than the standard trope of being evil because he&#8217;s a villain (although he is of course played by an English actor), the whole thing is carried off with depth, subtlety and aplomb by <strong>Tom Hiddleston</strong>.</p>
<p>Like Thor, Loki grows into himself, and it is only at the end that he makes  the transition from a young warrior of potential into someone capable of  evil. You know, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0121766/">the thing that George Lucas tried to do with the backstory for that guy in the black armour</a>, but ended up just embarrassing everyone?</p>
<p>I bet <strong>Natalie Portman</strong> (playing handy scientist Jane Foster) was glad to get that storyline right this time.</p>
<p>Speaking of Natalie Portman, let&#8217;s have a look at the female characters. They are admittedly thin on the ground, but those that are there are pretty good. Portman and <strong>Kat Dennings</strong> (playing Darcy) give good scientist and political scientist respectively, with the Jane Foster character updated from nurse to physicist.  Both women avoid the dull stereotype of being either predictably &#8220;spirited&#8221; or annoyingly wet. </p>

Fact.</p></div>
<p>The kickass <strong>Jaime Alexander</strong> plays Sif (Thor&#8217;s wife in the mythology, but we&#8217;ll leave that for the sequel, I suppose), heads up Team Junior Aesir in their fight to rescue Thor from Earth, and gets as much, if not more, fighting screen time as the rest of them.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s also wearing a costume that looks appropriate to fighting in, which is a personal bugbear of mine. No-one can fight crime in a bustier. No-one. Pay attention, people allegedly, eventually, making <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Woman#Live-action_film"><strong>Wonder Woman</strong></a>. I said <em>no-one.</em></p>
<p>There&#8217;s also some ice giants in it, but realistically the action element plays second fiddle to the storyline, and although there were a lot of fighting sequences my overall impressions of the film were about people and personalities rather than a barrage of things crashing into other things.</p>
<p>Which is no bad thing. I love action films, but I love them even more if there&#8217;s more to them than just action (are you listening, <strong>Michael Bay</strong>?)</p>
<p>And the action wasn&#8217;t exactly light on the ground &#8211; there were some very pleasing fights on all realms of reality from soldiers to robots to lots of ice giants getting hit in the face. A personal favourite caused me to turn and hi-five the person next to me (fortunately, Miranda, and not a stranger) because Thor had just smashed his hammer into the face of an enormous ice-beast and SAVED THE DAY in epic hero style.</p>
<p><strong>YOU SHOULD SEE THIS FILM BECAUSE:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You like comic book adaptations or action films</li>
<li>It has an amazing cast acting their socks off</li>
<li>You want to see how EPIC Norse Gods can be whether they are good or evil</li>
<li>You want to sing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCvMKcNJCAY">this song over and over</a> in your head when you&#8217;ve left the cinema</li>
<li>Just go and see it already!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>YOU SHOULD NOT SEE THIS FILM BECAUSE:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You are allergic to bling, muscles, fighting, deep voices or CGI ice giants.</li>
<li>You realise that they didn&#8217;t put Fenris Wolf in, OR cast Brian Blessed as Odin, and that makes you a bit sad.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Starry Starry Night</h3>
<p>All together now: THE LAST ALPHABET POST EVER. And it&#8217;s a word with one of the longest definitions I&#8217;ve yet come across: <em>zone</em>, first cited in 1500, from the Latin <em>zona </em>and the Greek <em>zone</em>, which originally means &#8216;girdle&#8217;.</p>
<div id="attachment_3045" style="width: 226px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Cranach-venus.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3045" data-attachment-id="3045" data-permalink="/2011/04/18/an-alphabet-of-feminism-26-z-is-for-zone/cranach-venus/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Cranach-venus.jpg?fit=1000%2C2280&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1000,2280" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Venus and Cupid" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Cranach-venus.jpg?fit=131%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Cranach-venus.jpg?fit=449%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-3045   " src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Cranach-venus.jpg?resize=216%2C493" alt="Venus naked except for a girdle and some necklaces, by Lucas Cranach the Younger c.1540" width="216" height="493" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Cranach-venus.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Cranach-venus.jpg?w=131&amp;ssl=1 131w, https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Cranach-venus.jpg?w=449&amp;ssl=1 449w" sizes="(max-width: 216px) 100vw, 216px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-3045" class="wp-caption-text">Blame him. He stole my clothes. Venus and her cestus, Lucas Cranach the Younger (1540s)</p></div>
<p>Its complexity is mainly owing to the range of disciplines that have claimed it for their own; these include astrology, astronomy, physical geography, mathematics, poetry, and crystallography. Its immediate practical meaning is geographical: &#8216;Each of the five &#8216;belts&#8217; or encircling regions, differing in climate, into which the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn and the Arctic and Antarctic circles divide the surface of the earth&#8217; – that is, &#8216;the <em>torrid</em> (burning) zone between the tropics, the (north and south) <em>temperate zones </em>extending from the tropics to the polar circles, and the <em>frigid </em>(frozen) zones<em> </em>(arctic and antarctic) within the polar circles&#8217;.</p>
<p>A <em>zone</em>, then, is a &#8216;belt&#8217; that marks out space, enclosing and dividing at once, as reflected in its vaguer sense from 1559 as &#8216;any region extending round the earth and comprised between definite limits&#8217;, where it is also applied to &#8216;a similar region in the heavens or on the surface of a planet&#8217;.</p>
<p>Of course, the Ancient Egyptians gave the practical sky-based role of <em>zoning </em>to a woman –<em> Nut</em>, the goddess of the sky, married to the earth god Geb (an unusual gendering). Nut is depicted throughout Egyptian art as a naked woman arched over the earth, balancing on her fingertips and tiptoes, and often covered in stars, from which position she protects the sun god Ra, and the earth below – a <em>zone </em>in its fourth sense (from 1591), as &#8216;a circumscribing or enclosing ring, band, or line&#8217;. Whence it is but a short step to 1608&#8217;s contribution to the party, <em>zone</em> as &#8216;a girdle or belt, as part of a dress&#8217; (chiefly &#8216;poetical&#8217;), which is really the only literal use for the word: before the word&#8217;s adoption into English, Ancient Greek women wore a &#8216;<em>zona</em>&#8216; under their clothes to accentuate the figure.<br />
<BR></BR></p>
<h3>Alas! My Girdle!</h3>
<p>So we end where we began: with an <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/10/04/an-alphabet-of-femininism-1-a-is-for-amazon/">extra-snazzy belt</a>. Women&#8217;s girdles have a long and varied history going back to the <em><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cestus">cestus</a> </em>or &#8216;Belt of Venus&#8217;, an ill-judged wedding present to the Goddess of Love from her husband Hephaestus which rendered her irresistible to men (and, appropriately, endures on as an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_of_Venus">astronomy term</a>). Martial refers to the <em>cestus </em>in his Epigrams as &#8216;a cincture that kindled love in Jupiter&#8217; (planetary theme ftw), and clearly considered it quite hot stuff himself, since it was &#8216;&#8230;still warm from Venus&#8217; fire&#8217;.</p>
<p>The Medieval West was not to be left behind in all this sexy-talk: no right-thinking female of the thirteen-hundreds considered herself fully sexed-up without a <em>gipon</em>, a type of corset designed to flatten the breasts and emphasise the stomach. And in case this proved insufficient, she might also pad her belly out for extra effect – well-rounded bellies <a href="http://cgfa.acropolisinc.com/eyck/eyck6.jpg">appear</a> <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Les_Tres_Riches_Heures_du_duc_de_Berry_avril_detail.jpg">again</a> and <a href="http://storage.canalblog.com/15/58/119589/34529891.jpg">again</a> in contemporary art – and, as with the Cranach Venus (above), a decorative <em>zone </em>was the perfect way to emphasise its shape, making this a garment no less sexually charged in the 1340s than the <a href="http://www.girdlezone.org/">1940s</a> (when, of course, its job was to hold the belly <em>in</em>). Like a <em>garter</em>, then, a <em>girdle </em>could serve as a fetishistic focal point for erotic (and indeed erogenous) <em>zones</em>, marking them out and keeping them restrained at the same time.</p>

<p>The Dictionary seems to have picked up something of this atmospheric heat itself, and brings us all back to earth by citing for this sense of the word Francis Quarles&#8217; <strong>Emblem VIII</strong> (&#8216;Shall these coarse hands untie / The sacred zone of thy virginity?&#8217; (1635)). Neatly, this citation highlights the flip-side of <em>zone</em>&#8216;s erotic focus – the Roman marriage ceremony famously culminated in the groom untying his wife&#8217;s girdle (enduring into the thigh-rubbing Latin slang phrase &#8216;<em>zonam solvere</em>&#8216; – &#8216;to untie the girdle&#8217;).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the <em>chastity belt</em> (which also encompasses the &#8216;torrid zone between the tropics&#8217;, if you want to be vulgar about it) supposedly made its debut in Western society during the Crusades, lest the mice should play while the cats were off murdering Muslims. They may have been a niche market then, but – under the waggish and consistent alias &#8216;Venus&#8217; belt&#8217; – they were certainly widespread enough by the sixteenth century to become a target for satire. It was not until 1718 that English got the separate word <em>zoned</em>, but its meaning – &#8216;wearing a zone or girdle, hence, chaste&#8217; – was clearly familiar to Francis Quarles, although he&#8217;s not talking about a literal woman, but about the relationship between body and soul.</p>
<p>John Donne plays with this conceit in his <strong><a href="http://www.luminarium.org/sevenlit/donne/elegy20.htm">Elegy: To His Mistress Going To Bed</a></strong>, which famously describes the &#8216;mistress&#8217; in question as &#8216;my America&#8217;. Her &#8216;girdle&#8217; glitters like &#8216;heaven&#8217;s <em>zone</em>&#8216; (viz.: the celestial sphere), but the woman&#8217;s body is itself a &#8216;world&#8217;, a &#8216;new-found land&#8217;, and the speaker&#8217;s &#8216;roving hands&#8217; explorers in a &#8216;kingdom&#8217; – just as in<strong><a href="http://www.luminarium.org/sevenlit/donne/sunrising.htm"> The Sun Rising</a></strong>, &#8216;she&#8217;s all states, and all princes I&#8217;. It&#8217;s not just Donne (<a href="http://www.luminarium.org/sevenlit/carew/rapture.htm">Thomas Carew</a> did it too): think how many landmarks are claimed for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sleeping_Lady">sleeping giantesses</a>, using the female body to map out geographical <em>zones</em>, just as geographical <em>zones</em> can be used to map out a woman (what else is the <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mons_pubis">mons veneris</a></em>?), and think back to <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_2709_2.jpg">Sir Francis Dashwood, landscaping pudendas in his garden</a>.</p>
<p>Much like the <em>zone </em>itself, this Alphabet has tried to encompass various notions of womanhood. Come back soon and maybe there&#8217;ll be a final post mortem-style analysis&#8230; </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>New week, new poster&#8230; and a change of tone. Meet Hodge, folks, and the first letter in her fully illustrated Alphabet series, where we do a bit of dictionary-delving, art history and culture-vulturing from A to Z.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Welcome to Hodge&#8217;s <strong>ALPHABET OF FEMINISM</strong>, inaugural entry, number one: pull up a chair, gather your hot beverages round.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The more specific aims of this series of posts will, it is hoped, become clearer through practice, as it works from A-Z.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But put simply, the idea is to address (with reasonable neutrality), the make-up of the English mother-tongue, to consider how the language has evolved over the centuries, and in the process to prompt some questions about how gender issues are woven into the fabric of the language we use everyday.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Incidentally, when I refer to &#8216;the dictionary&#8217;, I am referring to the Oxford English Dictionary.</p>
<h6 style="text-align: center;">A</h6>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">AMAZON</h2>
<h3>&#8220;This. I Have No Use For This. Remove It.&#8221;</h3>

<p>For those readers who never owned the Greek alphabet on a tea-towel, the &#8216;maz&#8217; sound mid-<em>Amazon</em> is the same &#8216;maz&#8217; you find in &#8216;mastectomy&#8217; and its (mostly medical) cognates. This is because the Amazons in question – a race of female warriors alleged to have lived in ancient Scythia, and the first definition for the first word of the Alphabet of Femininism (hoorah!) – were said to have been rather expert in just this procedure. Or, as the dictionary puts it, rather dryly – and, indeed, euphemistically – &#8216;they destroyed their right breast to avoid interfering with the use of the bow&#8217;.</p>
<p>In so self-mastectomising, this army of women obviously lay themselves open to the extended (and more explicitly gender-specific) meaning that <em>amazon</em> took on around the mid-eighteenth century. Here, an <em>amazon </em>is &#8216;a very strong, tall, or masculine woman&#8217;, unsurprising since they are, etymologically, removers of those most vexed of female glands in favour of ease in brandishing weaponry (more generally considered A Man&#8217;s Job).</p>
<p>This all said, the original Amazons do not appear to have been either an (exclusively) lesbian tribe, or even an anti-maternal one: Strabo, the Greek geographer, would have it that they periodically had a baby-breeding field trip to a neighbouring male tribe (the Gargareans). The resultant boy-children were exposed or sent back to their fathers; the girls kept and trained up In The Amazon Way, a rare gender upending for the olden days.</p>
<h3>Alas! My Girdle!</h3>
<p>But perhaps the most famous of these dedicated Amazons is Hippolyte-slash-Hippolyta, the owner of a  magical &#8216;girdle&#8217;, which Hercules stole in one of his less catchy labours (bit pathetic altogether, isn&#8217;t it? It&#8217;s got a bit of a spotty thirteen year old boy feel to it, in fact. &#8216;Hey Hercules! See that woman? I dare you to steal her girdle! Yeeah, dude, you rock!&#8217; – That said, I&#8217;ve never been completely sure what a &#8216;girdle&#8217; means in Ancient Scythia: I can&#8217;t really imagine an army of one-breasted women in the habit of frequent &#8216;bow handling&#8217; being particularly concerned about how cinched their waists are. My childhood book of <em>Greek Myths And Legends</em> depicts it as a sort of extra snazzy belt, so that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going with).</p>

<p>Ahem. Post-Hercules, Hippolyta appears in every battered school copy of <strong>A Midsummer Night&#8217;s Dream</strong>, as the future wife of Theseus, who &#8216;wooed her with his sword&#8217; (oh Theseus, you charmer), and ex-flame of Oberon, King of The Fairies. Shakespeare, whose use of language is so influential that you can expect to bump into him frequently in these dark and twisted lexical corridors, isn&#8217;t otherwise a great user of the word <em>amazon</em>, although he does make it into the dictionary&#8217;s quotations for the word&#8217;s extended, more generic sense, as &#8216;a female warrior&#8217;, which is the first in a pair that ends in the aforementioned &#8216;very strong, tall, or masculine woman&#8217;, unsurprisingly considered &#8216;forbidding to men&#8217; by the author of <em>Sermons To Young Women </em>in the eighteenth century.</p>
<h3>Dot Com</h3>
<p>One contemporary application this more general sense has had, curiously enough, is in the modelling world, where the &#8216;freakish&#8217; aesthetic of catwalk models (and presumably also their exoticism) makes the designation &#8216;amazon&#8217; / &#8216;amazonian&#8217; in its sense as a &#8216;very strong, tall, or masculine woman&#8217; surprisingly true to its lexical origin (annoyingly, if fittingly, for the inaugural post of an alphabet, the prominence of a particular shopping site &#8216;everything from A-Z&#8217;, and the tendencies of said supermodels to write their autobiographies, obscures any such instances of the word on Google, so you&#8217;ll have to take my nonspecific memory for it).</p>
<p>Moving on, I particularly like the further sense <em>amazon </em>acquired sometime around the sixteenth or seventeenth century – now, alas, obsolete – as &#8216;the queen in chess&#8217;, who I always thought of as quiet sort of feminist icon, maintaining, as Francis Beale asserts, &#8216;alwayes&#8230;her owne colour&#8217;, and zipping around the board with an alacrity denied to her technically more important consort.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>To the men an Amazon never fails to be forbidding.</strong></p>
<p>JAMES FORDYCE, Sermons To Young Women (published 1767)</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>The Queen, or Amazon, is placed in the fourth house from the corner of the field by the side of her King, and alwayes in her owne colour.</strong></p>
<p>FRANCIS BEALE, <em>Biochimo&#8217;s Royall Game of Chesse-play</em> (translated 1656)</p></blockquote>
<h3>Yes, But How Many People Does She Shag?</h3>
<p>As will become tediously common during these gynocentric word-journeys, it seems virtually impossible to think of a &#8216;strong, masculine woman&#8217; without at some point branching into her sexuality; thus, the final meaning of <em>amazon</em> (unsurprisingly, the Victorians&#8217; contribution) as in opposition to a &#8216;vestal&#8217; (another group of women bound together tribal-style, although for an altogether different purpose). As in, &#8216;Oh man, that girl&#8217;s no vestal; she&#8217;s an <em>amazon.</em>&#8216;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">However, <em>amazon</em> is actually a bit of a relief because its overwhelming lexical impression is one of a guarded kind of respect: Hippolyta would, I think, be satisfied.<a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/A-is-for-Amazon.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="3213" data-permalink="/2010/10/04/an-alphabet-of-femininism-1-a-is-for-amazon/a-is-for-amazon/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/A-is-for-Amazon.jpg?fit=1426%2C1784&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1426,1784" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="A is for Amazon" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/A-is-for-Amazon.jpg?fit=239%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/A-is-for-Amazon.jpg?fit=818%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3213" title="A is for Amazon" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/A-is-for-Amazon-818x1024.jpg?resize=573%2C717" alt="Illustration by Hodge: inital A for Amazon in blue.
