										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This edition of Found Feminism is also part of a series on the theme of women and protest. The full series is collected <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/tag/revolting-women/">under the tag &#8220;Revolting Women&#8221;</a>.</em></p>
<p>They meet every Wednesday at 6pm and stand around<a href="http://www.ukattraction.com/london/edith-cavell-memorial-statue.htm"> the statue of legendary badass</a> and feminist hero <a href="http://www.edithcavell.org.uk/">Edith Cavell</a>, wearing black and holding signs. They don&#8217;t speak. They have an awesome homemade banner with some very cool patchwork stitching on it. We at BadRep Towers are very fond of both <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/06/20/badrep-goes-slutwalking/">banners</a> and <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/07/12/found-feminism-patchwork-of-the-century/">patchwork</a>.</p>

<p>They are the <a href="http://www.womeninblack.org/en/london"><strong>Women in Black</strong></a>. Not to be confused with their <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRuHk6Drj2U">male counterparts</a> &#8211; the Women in Black are probably not our &#8216;best, last and only line of defence&#8217; against extra-terrestrial invasion, although I wouldn&#8217;t put it past them.</p>
<p>So, who are they and why is it a Found Feminism? Well, they&#8217;re an international network that offer a specific form of peaceful protest model &#8211; wear black, hold signs, don&#8217;t chant &#8211; and link up all the people (men AND women) in the world who do this or who want to do it.</p>
<p>Women in Black officially started off in the late 80s in Israel with women protesting against the occupation of Palestine, but they acknowledge their roots in much earlier female-led non-violent movements such as <a href="http://www.blacksash.org.za/">Black Sash</a> and the<a href="http://www.wilpfinternational.org/"> Women&#8217;s International League for Peace and Freedom</a>.</p>
<p>Women in Black are therefore part of a much wider story about the long-term involvement of women, and feminists, in the peace movement, in anti-war demonstrations and in alternative (including non-violent) forms of protest and revolution.</p>
<p>At a time of shouty, flash-in-the-pan protests and unpredictable acts of anger, a regular, silent protest is interesting in and of itself. It&#8217;s a reminder of the other ways to influence and change the world, as well as recognising the value of solidarity across borders. Something Edith herself would have probably approved of.</p>
<blockquote><p>Patriotism is not enough. I must have no hatred or bitterness towards anyone.</p>
<p>&#8211; Edith Cavell </p></blockquote>
