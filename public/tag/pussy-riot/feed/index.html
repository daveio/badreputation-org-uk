										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Inspired by those plucky Pussy Riot gals and their &#8216;being sent to a penal colony for a peaceful protest&#8217; hi-jinks in Russia last year, I set out to find tracks from riot grrrl bands around the world. And just to shift the focus for once, I&#8217;ve ignored the US, Canada, Australia, Japan, Europe and other super wealthy places.</p>
<p>&#8216;Are there grrrls in the majority world?&#8217; I wondered. The answer is yes, and they rock. In fact I&#8217;ve made a <a title="Majority World Riot Grrrl Playlist" href="http://bit.ly/majoritygrrrl" target="_blank"><strong>Majority World Riot Grrrl playlist</strong></a> which can be found for your delectation. Big shout out to <a title="Riot Grrrl Berlin Compilations" href="http://riotgrrrlberlin.tumblr.com/grrrlcompilations" target="_blank">Riot Grrrl Berlin</a> and their fantastic compilations, on which lots of these bands feature.</p>
<h2><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/tank-girl.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="13254" data-permalink="/2013/03/08/majority-world-riot-grrrl/tank-girl/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/tank-girl.jpg?fit=454%2C381&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="454,381" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Tank Girl Nepal Promo Pic" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/tank-girl.jpg?fit=300%2C252&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/tank-girl.jpg?fit=454%2C381&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignleft  wp-image-13254" alt="Tank Girl Nepal Promo Pic" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/tank-girl.jpg?resize=327%2C275" width="327" height="275" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Nepal</h2>
<p>The first band I found was an anarchafeminist outfit from Nepal called <a title="Tank Girl" href="http://kasamaproject.org/2010/04/14/tank-girl-anarcha-feminist-punk-from-nepal/" target="_blank"><strong>Tank Girl</strong></a>. Nepal has a deeply traditional patriarchal society; marital rape was outlawed only in 2006 and still carries just a six month sentence. Rape survivors are often ostracised, having &#8216;brought shame&#8217; to their family and wider community. Dalit (or &#8216;low-caste&#8217;) women face additional discrimination and extremely high levels of violence.</p>
<p>One of Tank Girl&#8217;s members, Sareena Rai, is involved in two other feminist DIY punk bands, <a title="Rai Ko Ris" href="http://diypunknepal.blogspot.com.au/2011/06/short-interview-with-rai-ko-ris.html " target="_blank">Rai Ko Ris</a> and <a title="Nepal" href="ttp://subcultatlas.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/nepal-stories-from-nepal.html " target="_blank">Naya Faya</a>, and works to help Dalit women to protect themselves from gender-based violence, delivering self-defence training in her house. Which is pretty awesome.</p>
<h2>Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia</h2>
<p>I found a few more Asia-Pacific riot grrrl bands, including the adorable <a title="Youtube - Fatal Posporos" href="http://youtu.be/exu28Xt3Trs" target="_blank"><strong>Fatal Posporos</strong></a> from the Philippines and <a title="Myspace - Pretty Riot" href="http://www.myspace.com/prettyriot09 " target="_blank"><strong>Pretty Riot</strong></a> from Indonesia. As well as bands <a title="Hellsister" href="http://ohmytracks.com/#/music/Hellsister" target="_blank"><strong>Hellsister</strong></a> and <a title="Myspace - Dance On Your Grave" href="http://www.myspace.com/doygmusic" target="_blank"><strong>Dance On Your Grave</strong></a>, the scene in Malaysia was (and hopefully still is) large enough to support a zine distro called <a title="Grrrl:Rebel" href="http://grrrlzines.net/interviews/grrrlrebel.htm" target="_blank"><strong>Grrrl:Rebel</strong></a>. “Through zines, people in the scene are much more exposed to stuffs that were somewhat limited to them and the public before” founder Carol told <a title="Grrrzines" href="http://grrrlzines.net/" target="_blank">GrrrlZines.net</a> in 2001. “In countries like Malaysia and Singapore, you would get arrested if you write any articles that can be considered as threats to the government.”</p>
<p>It&#8217;s comments like that which I find so remarkable, dropped into interviews about the role of girls in the punk scene and the best local bands which could kind of be about anywhere.</p>
<h2>Africa and the Middle East</h2>
<p>While I couldn&#8217;t find any trace of a riot grrrl scene in Africa, I did happen upon a 2011 documentary called <a title="Afropop - Punk In Africa" href="http://www.afropop.org/wp/6866/punk-in-africa/" target="_blank"><strong>Punk In Africa</strong></a> which sounds good. And in the Middle East, grrrls are thin on the ground, but judging from the cracking <a title="MidEast Tunes" href="http://mideastunes.com/" target="_blank">MidEastTunes</a> website there are plenty of women active in dark metal and goth, including Bahrain&#8217;s first all-girl metal band <a title="LA Times - Scarlet Tear" href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/babylonbeyond/2010/08/bahrain-.html" target="_blank"><strong>Scarlet Tear</strong></a>.</p>
<h2>Mexico, Venezuela and Brazil</h2>
<p>South America does seem to have a sizeable riot grrrl base &#8211; my cursory search turned up bands in Mexico, Venezuela, Chile, Colombia and Argentina. <a title="Myspace - Le Butcherettes" href="http://www.myspace.com/lebutcherettes " target="_blank"><strong>Le Butcherettes</strong></a> from Mexico are definitely worth a listen, and I&#8217;d like to find more by a Venezuelan skapunk outfit called <a title="Pure Volume - 7 Potencias" href="http://www.purevolume.com/7potencias" target="_blank"><strong>7 Potencias</strong></a> who have a song called &#8216;Feminista de Bolsillo&#8217;, which I&#8217;m led to believe translates as &#8216;Pocket Feminist&#8217;.</p>
<p>The biggest scene seems to be in Brazil, which boasts a huge list of bands and artists, including <a title="Myspace - Dominatrix" href="http://www.myspace.com/contatodominatrix" target="_blank"><strong>Dominatrix</strong></a>, <a title="Bandcamp - Siete Armas" href="http://sietearmas.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Siete Armas</strong></a> and <a title="Myspace - Bertha Lutz" href="http://www.myspace.com/bandaberthalutz" target="_blank"><strong>Bertha Lutz</strong></a>, with her irresistibly-titled track &#8216;Feminism? Yes Please!&#8217;.</p>
<p>Bit of context: while Brazil is the world&#8217;s sixth largest economy, there is still vast inequality. And although it currently has a female President for the first time in Dilma Rouseff, women make up just 8.6% of the seats in Parliament. Abortion is legal only to save a woman&#8217;s life or in cases of rape, and in 2010, it was <a title="Wikigender - Brazil" href="http://www.wikigender.org/index.php/Gender_Equality_in_Brazil" target="_blank">reported</a> that 200,000 women a year are hospitalized for complications of illegal abortion.</p>
<p>The reasons behind riot grrrl&#8217;s popularity in Brazil are even the subject of an <a title="Journals" href="http://journals.lib.washington.edu/index.php/intersections/article/view/9544" target="_blank">academic paper by Calla Hummel</a>, who recognises the political significance and adaptability of this particular bit of shouty youth culture:</p>
<blockquote><p>Brazilian riot grrrl is one of the sites where Western cultural hegemony is being called into question&#8230; As it moves across borders, riot grrrl becomes a form of transnational feminism – and grrrls must address how ideas and material originating in a given locale may resonate, change, or delegitimize ideas and work in another.</p></blockquote>
<p>Gender inequality is a global problem which varies in its expression across different cultural contexts. It&#8217;s not an &#8216;over there&#8217; issue, but in some places it&#8217;s more severe than in others. Similarly, riot grrrl anywhere is awesome, but the courage and kickassness of the grrrls in these bands is pretty inspiring.</p>
<p>As a band member called Isabella quoted by Hummel says:</p>
<blockquote><p>As long as we keep getting letters from the middle of the jungle, from a tiny, three person town in the Amazon, from some girl saying, &#8216;Feminism saved my life, thank you,&#8217; we will keep doing it.</p></blockquote>

					<description><![CDATA[The other week I went to see the all-female cast production of Julius Caesar at the Donmar Warehouse.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The other week I went to see the all-female cast production of <strong>Julius Caesar</strong> at London&#8217;s <a title="Donmar Warehouse Theatre Website" href="http://www.donmarwarehouse.com/whats-on/donmar-warehouse/2012/julius-caesar" target="_blank">Donmar Warehouse</a>.</p>
<p>Directed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phyllida_Lloyd" target="_blank">Phyllida Lloyd</a>, this is a gritty, bold production set in a women’s prison – and performed in a very small, intimate theatre space. This is almost punk rock Shakespeare, and occasionally it <em>has</em> some punk rock in it. If the Pussy Riot reference poster doesn’t clue you in already: this is a production with guts.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Julius-Caesar-1MB-550x746.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="12959" data-permalink="/2013/01/07/theatre-review-all-female-julius-caesar/julius-caesar-1mb-550x746/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Julius-Caesar-1MB-550x746.jpg?fit=550%2C746&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="550,746" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Julius-Caesar-1MB-550&#215;746" data-image-description="&lt;p&gt;Poster for Julius Caesar: black and white photograph of four young women in balaclavas of different colours&lt;/p&gt;

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar_(play)" target="_blank"><strong>Julius Caesar</strong></a> isn’t a play I’ve studied in much depth, and I know plenty of other reviewers will do a better academic job, so I’m going to focus on what I liked about it:</p>
<ol>
<li>More parts to female actors! Hooray! Also, the production necessitates a certain degree of queer/genderqueer acceptance, as both Brutus and Caesar’s wives play a significant part in the story. Get on board and get on with the plot.</li>
<li>The initial prison set-up is ingenious, and really adds a few layers for the first half – Caesar is a much-loved but bullying top dog in the setting. And one of the first things Frances Barber&#8217;s Caesar does when she comes on stage is smooch Mark Anthony (Cush Jumbo). Whoa! That makes… a lot of sense, actually, and adds a brilliant ambiguity to the characters’ different declarations of love for each other.</li>
<li>Did I mention punk rock? There’s a bit of live music with a drumkit on wheels used to brilliant effect.</li>
<li>The soothsayer is presented as the clearly-slightly-unhinged inmate who is usually seen carrying a doll and with her hair always in bunches. Adult-as-child is really unnerving and in this production, it adds a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassandra" target="_blank">Cassandra</a>-esque layer.</li>
<li>I admit it: at times I was perving. Holy hell, Cassius (Jenny Jules)&#8217;s abs are amazing.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/JuliusC_007.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="12960" data-permalink="/2013/01/07/theatre-review-all-female-julius-caesar/juliusc_007/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/JuliusC_007.jpg?fit=750%2C500&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="750,500" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="JuliusC_007" data-image-description="&lt;p&gt;Photograph of women in prison uniforms, holding dinner trays, cheering as one prisoner in a beret walks past.

" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/JuliusC_007.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/JuliusC_007.jpg?fit=750%2C500&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-12960" title="JuliusC_007" alt="The cast in full flow in their prison setting" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/JuliusC_007-300x200.jpg?resize=300%2C200" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/JuliusC_007.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/JuliusC_007.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>One problem for me was that as the action scaled up after Caesar&#8217;s assassination, I wasn&#8217;t sure what to do with the prison setting. Part of my brain was still trying to work out what significance the setting still had &#8211; for best enjoyment you just need to leave that behind and focus on with the plot, but my brain couldn&#8217;t quite do it. </p>
<p>The setting and the tale make an interesting mix, but they don&#8217;t fit perfectly throughout. <a title="Brick - movie on IMDB" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0393109/" target="_blank"><strong>Brick</strong></a> it ain&#8217;t. </p>
<p>Also, there was an interesting dissonance between the &#8216;honour&#8217; described (OK, makes sense) and the &#8216;love of Rome&#8217; which motivated Brutus and Cassius (but why do you love this place? It&#8217;s&#8230; prison.)</p>
<p>But if the <a title="Telegraph review" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/theatre-reviews/9746284/Julius-Caesar-at-Donmar-Warehouse-review.html" target="_blank">Torygraph</a> is <a title="Telegraph review" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/charlesmoore/9733633/I-fear-this-director-comes-to-bury-Caesar.html" target="_blank">spitting bullets</a> (twice) over the casting, you know you&#8217;re doing something right:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is a certain poetic justice that Lloyd’s effort should find itself in direct competition with the classy, respectful and hugely entertaining all-male versions of <strong>Twelfth Night</strong> and <strong>Richard III</strong>, which are running in rep at the Apollo. These productions would undoubtedly have met with Shakespeare’s approval.</p>
<p>&#8211; Tim Walker, <strong>Telegraph</strong> 14/12/12</p></blockquote>
<p>BUT WHAT ABOUT TEH MENS? </p>
<p>Dude, if you feel that threatened by affirmative action: there is <strong>everywhere else</strong> that you could go.</p>
<p>All in all this production is tough, gutsy and giving its all to sort out the <a title="Guardian Article on Under Representation of Women in Theatre" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/dec/10/theatre-england-women-underrepresented" target="_blank">massive under-representation</a> of women in theatre. </p>
<p>And the modern, unpretentious setting gives you a huge amount to think about &#8211; above and beyond the plot of an already dense play. It&#8217;s on until the 9th of February.</p>

">1</a></sup> once said that you ignore the writing on the walls at your peril. I hope the same is true of stickers.</p>
<p>In a world where it&#8217;s increasingly hard to get your message across, and available methods of communication are becoming more and more sophisticated, it&#8217;s refreshing to see a return to the simple things in life.</p>
<p>Like slapping a sticker somewhere nice and prominent that screams <em>FREE PUSSY RIOT</em> in fat felt tip pen.</p>
<p>I found this beauty a couple of months ago whilst walking across the Golden Jubilee pedestrian bridge. Sitting loud and proud, obviously homemade, with bright colours and a take-no-prisoners message.</p>

<p>So, why is this a Found Feminism?</p>
<p>Well, obviously there&#8217;s the show of support for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pussy_Riot" target="_blank">Pussy Riot</a> and the spreading of their message. Whoever slapped this on the wall was inspired to make and display the sticker themselves. I hope there are hundreds of them stuck around London. I only found the one. I hope other people find more. I hope they make their own.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also going to add points for the artwork, done in a way that echoes feminist punk stylings. It&#8217;s that hand-drawn aesthetic of &#8220;we did this in our bedroom&#8221; personal creation. It mirrors the hand-knitted balaclavas of the band members, and it&#8217;s the heart and soul of grassroots movements.</p>
<p>Plus, it&#8217;s funny.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying that feminism should be side-splitting all the time, although I do dislike that stereotype about feminists as po-faced, dungarees-wearing, yoghurt-plaiting monsters<sup><a href="/2012/10/22/found-feminism-rubber-face-putin/#footnote_1_12353" id="identifier_1_12353" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" Actually, I really like dungarees, and would quite happily wear them, especially for their iconic status in (mis)representing feminism. But that&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m a real person and not a stereotype! I cannot plait yoghurt, however. ">2</a></sup> who hate all fun and all jokes. But being able to make someone smile when you get your point across can be valuable &#8211; and who wouldn&#8217;t grin at this sticker, with its cheerful two fingers up to one of the most terrifying and powerful men in the world? Doesn&#8217;t matter how strong you think you are, Mr Putin &#8211; the writing on the wall in London thinks you&#8217;re a dick.</p>
<p>Finally, there&#8217;s the political message here. The sticker, and Pussy Riot, are part of a rekindling of the political power of feminism, reminding us all that there&#8217;s more we can do (much, much more) than form elegant critiques of the use of the female nude in art for the Sunday edition of the national newspapers.</p>
<p>There are problems out in the world that an active, aware and politicised feminist movement can work to solve. Should work to solve. And the fact that someone with a few highlighter pens and a handful of stickers is getting out there and having a go, in their own way, at doing it should put a rocket under those of us who have more reach and power to do what we can.</p>
<p>So yeah, fuck rubber face Putin.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[From the past few months of coverage and debate, here are just a few things which have interested me on the complexities of Pussy Riot’s background and media presentation.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since we first wrote on Pussy Riot <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/02/06/revolting-women-slight-return-russias-pussy-riot/">back in February</a>, widespread attention has been given to the subsequent arrest, trial and imprisonment of three members of the group, while <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/15/us-russia-protest-idUSBRE88E06R20120915">mass anti-government protest continues in Russia</a>. From the past few months of coverage and debate, here are just a few things which have interested me on the complexities of Pussy Riot’s background and media presentation.</p>
<p>This (mildly NSFW) video is кисья ересь (Heresy of Little Cats), by the Russian electro-punk band Barto:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/oyMMqUzRa1A?rel=0" frameborder="0" width="420" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>As a non-speaker of Russian who hasn’t found the lyrics anywhere, I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a lot I’m not getting, but I like the song, the band are <a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/arts_n_ideas/article/electro-punk-barto-is-a-band-with-an-ideology/425794.html">pretty admirable</a>, and I like the video’s satirical emphasis on the patriarchal intertwining of political and religious authorities – the formal alliance of Putin’s government and the Russian Orthodox Church, making it possible for civil disobedience to be framed as blasphemy, was a point of contention highlighted by the Pussy Riot trial.</p>
<p>I found the song via <a href="http://myplacefp7.wordpress.com/2012/08/17/get-on-the-way-pussy-riot/">this post</a>, which discusses the relatively muted response by the Russian underground music scene to the group’s trial and imprisonment. It also corrects the impression of Pussy Riot as (merely?) a feminist punk band, when they are more a product of the intersection between political activism and performance art:</p>
<blockquote><p>As a matter of fact Pussy Riot, although calling themselves a punk-band and using the sign of punk in their performances, never belonged to the Russian punk scene. They consider themselves as art-actionists, clearly place themselves in the context of contemporary Russian actionism, quoting the names of Prigov, Brener, Kulik and other art-provocateurs of the 1990s.</p></blockquote>
<p>So Pussy Riot’s frequently mentioned connection with riot grrrl has more to do with the latter’s existence as a DIY subculture involving zines, art, détournement and activism, than with music alone. Which is fair enough; back in the 90s, one of the odder of Courtney Love’s swipes at Kathleen Hanna, in fact, was that “She&#8217;s not really in a band&#8230; She&#8217;s a political activist who took a bunch of women&#8217;s studies classes.&#8221; On the subject of Pussy Riot, Hanna herself had <a title="Kathleen Hanna" href="http://www.kathleenhanna.com/seriously-they-are-in-a-fucking-cage/" target="_blank">this</a> to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>What if people all over the world started their own performance groups, bands, art collectives, etc… and called them things like Pussy Riot Olympia. Pussy Riot, Athens Greece, Pussy Riot Paris, etc….And maybe if this trial turns out as the prosecutors want it to, with the women getting at least 3 years, we all play benefits and go to Russia en masse under the banner that we are all Pussy Riot, Yoko Ono could be in Pussy Riot, Patti Smith could be wearing a mask next to a troupe of girls from Tennesee storming the Cathedral of Christ the Savior screaming “We are all Pussy Riot!!!”</p></blockquote>
<p>As I wrote in February, it makes sense to consider Pussy Riot in the context of the former Soviet Union’s <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/adamcurtis/2012/01/the_years_of_stagnation_and_th.html">long and fascinating history</a> of political protest coalescing around<em> avant garde</em> art and music, especially punk. The Western media, perhaps understandably, tended instead to present the band in more straightforward and simplistic terms – rendering them more comprehensible to a Western audience, sure, but often in a less than helpful manner. I’d been hoping someone would pick up on the patronising and infantilising aspects of much of the media presentation of Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, Maria Alyokhina and Yekaterina Samutsevich, and, in <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/08/manic-pixie-dream-dissidents-how-the-world-misunderstands-pussy-riot/261309/">this article</a>, Sarah Kendzior nails it:</p>
<blockquote><p>Imagine this: The three men sit in court, awaiting their verdict. The youngest, a experienced dissident described by the media as a “sultry sex symbol” with “Angelina Jolie lips”, glances at his colleague, an activist praised by the Associated Press for his “pre-Raphaelite looks”. Between them sits a third man, whose lack of glamour has led the New Republic to label him “the brain” and deem his hair a “poof of dirty blonde frizz”. The dissidents – or “boys” as they are called in headlines around the world – have been the subject of numerous fashion and style profiles ever since they first spoke out against the Russian government. “He’s a flash of moving color,” the New York Times writes approvingly about their protests, “never an individual boy.” If this sounds ridiculous, it should – and not only because I changed the gender… Pussy Riot identifies as feminist, but you would never know it from the Western media, who celebrate the group with the same language that the Russian regime uses to marginalize them. The three members of Pussy Riot are “girls”, despite the fact that all of them are in their twenties and two of them are mothers. They are “punkettes”, diminutive variations on a 1990s indie-rock prototype that has little resemblance to Pussy Riot’s own trajectory as independent artists and activists.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, as Kendzior also points out, Pussy Riot have far more pressing concerns than being mischaracterized in the press. But:</p>
<blockquote><p>Pussy Riot also tells us a lot about how we see non-Western political dissent in the new media age, and could suggest a habit of mischaracterizing their grave mission in terms that feel more familiar but ultimately sell the dissidents short: youthful rebellion, rock and roll, damsels in distress.</p></blockquote>
<p>A lot of this sentiment is familiar: an impulse to treat protest in which women, particularly young women, are prominent, as fun, flippant, and fundamentally unserious. It’s the reverse of the censorious and sensationalist ‘Rage of the Girl Rioters’ response to the 2010 UK student protests. In the case of Pussy Riot, arguments for their sympathetic treatment are often explicitly predicated on the power imbalance involved – they are ‘just’ ordinary women (or indeed ‘girls’), what threat to the state can they possibly pose? – which surely entrenches the idea of women as both relatively powerless and harmless, rather than enabling any sort of feminist empowerment. Away from such frustrating portayals, however, there’s something to be said for the earlier stages of Pussy Riot’s trajectory, which offer examples both of how music can form part of a wider oppositional movement and for how women’s protest can be collective and anonymous, with no need of iconic or martyred figureheads.</p>
<p>And yes, I do realise this post can be summarised as: &#8220;Pussy Riot? Preferred their earlier work, before they got so commercial&#8221;. So it goes.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Pussy Riot, like the Sex Pistols, have a name designed to make headlines, and a bit more political substance to back up the sensationalism. Formed in Moscow last September, they've come to prominence in the UK media.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>They decline to reveal the smallest details, aiming to maintain total secrecy. They will say only that most of the band members met at the small protests held by Russia’s once-feeble opposition, from monthly illegal demonstrations calling for the right to assembly to banned gay pride marches.

&#8211; <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/feb/02/pussy-riot-protest-russia"><strong>Guardian</strong>, 2nd February 2012</a></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://pussy-riot.livejournal.com/profile"><strong>Pussy Riot</strong></a>, like the Sex Pistols, have a name designed to make headlines, and a bit more political substance to back up the sensationalism. Formed in Moscow last September, this offshoot of Russia’s complex and fractured political scene has come to prominence in the UK media in the context of <a href="http://www.channel4.com/news/undemocratic-putin-sparks-russias-opposition">protests</a> against political corruption which have been gaining in volume and intensity after parliamentary elections last December. In mid-January, one of the collective’s impromptu guerrilla gigs, taking place on Red Square opposite the Kremlin, ended with its members <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/9028106/Russian-all-girl-punk-band-Pussy-Riot-arrested-for-performing-Vladimir-Putin-song.html">detained by police</a>.</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/qEiB1RYuYXw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/feb/03/pussy-riot-kremlin-protest-riot-grrrl">Laura Barton in the <strong>Guardian</strong></a>, picking up on the band’s citing of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bikini_Kill">Bikini Kill</a> as an inspiration, offers a slightly short-sighted view of 90s Riot Grrrl as an antecedent for the expression of &#8216;an alternative female voice&#8217;. While the group clearly do reference Riot Grrrl’s &#8216;tone of wild irreverence&#8217;, it also makes sense to consider Pussy Riot in the context of the former Soviet Union&#8217;s long and fascinating history of political protest coalescing around <em>avant garde</em> art and music, especially punk. Adam Curtis&#8217; <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/adamcurtis/2012/01/the_years_of_stagnation_and_th.html">recent blog</a> is an interesting attempt to make sense of this sort of determinedly oppositional culture which has been notable by its <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/nov/10/protest-music-akala-grace-petrie">relative absence</a> from the UK&#8217;s current wave of socio-political protest. Similarly, the clash of sartorial signifiers which Pussy Riot provide by combining miniskirts and stockings with ski-masks and balaclavas could be a legacy of Riot Grrl too, but as a practical measure it has as much in common with other Anonymous-style contemporary protest movements, not to mention the general history of <a href="http://theoccupiedtimes.co.uk/?p=2259">masking and disguise in protest</a>.</p>
<p>Russia does have a long tradition of women in protest, notably the <a href="http://www.oocities.org/mushkah/WomenRevolution.html">1917 revolution </a>in which women played a prominent part, encouraged by the <a href="http://writerinterviews.blogspot.com/2008/06/ana-siljak.html">intersection </a> of socialism with many of the goals of women’s liberation. Pussy Riot cite this ‘deep tradition&#8230; of gender and revolution – we&#8217;ve had amazing women revolutionaries.’ They add that ‘the revolution should be done by women&#8230; For now, they don&#8217;t beat or jail us as much’. This assertion ties in with <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-sUOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA144&amp;lpg=PA144&amp;dq=women+protesters+history+impunity&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gfiH9oiQKN&amp;sig=RQ5cWgISBTk4MMmPz-6sYc8joT8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=54EuT7eMAuit0QX_lLGtCA&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=women%20protesters%20history%20impunity&amp;f=false">historical debates</a> on the ability of women to take part in protest or civil disobedience with a greater degree of impunity than men &#8211; an ideal which <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-16267436">isn&#8217;t always borne out</a> by the treatment of female protesters.</p>
<p>Contemporary Russian politics &#8211; like any &#8211; are <a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v34/n01/stephen-holmes/fragments-of-a-defunct-state">not a straightforward matter</a>, and the extent of Pussy Riot&#8217;s relevance and representativeness remains to be seen. But in a context where growing and disparate opposition groups are encountering heavy and often violent repression across the world, the ways in which women participate in protest, and the styles of self-expression they employ, are always worth noting.</p>
