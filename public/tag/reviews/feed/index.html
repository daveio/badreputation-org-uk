					<description><![CDATA[Here's some probably-not-very-surprising news: not many of our big national galleries have female directors. But at the Tate, that's changed. What does the new rehang bring to the space? ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s some probably-not-very-surprising news: not many of our big national galleries have female directors. The Ashmolean, The Fitzwilliam, the National Portrait Gallery, The National Gallery, The National Museums Scotland and National Galleries Scotland, the Natural History Museum, the Tate, The Wallace Collection, the V&amp;A and the British Museum are all directed by men.</p>
<p>This is an especially grim state of affairs since in the rest of the museums, galleries and cultural heritage sector women actually outnumber their male colleagues &#8211; sixty percent to forty.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s heartening that Dr Penelope Curtis, a specialist in sculpture and British art, should have taken up the mantle of Director of Tate Britain. Since her appointment in 2010 she has been largely overseeing <a title="Tate - The Millbank Project" href="http://www.tate.org.uk/about/projects/millbank-project/introduction-penelope-curtis" target="_blank">The Millbank Project</a>, whose most recent result is The Tate Rehang.</p>
<p>So they&#8217;ve got the hammer and nails out.</p>
<p>The London-dwellers among you might remember the old Tate Britain &#8211; pictures ordered roughly by category or theme. That big Pre-Raphaelites room with the dodgy John Martin landscapes next door. A room of Modernism. A room of sixteenth-century portraits. That&#8217;s all gone.</p>
<p>In its place is a &#8216;Walk through British Art&#8217; &#8211; pictures ordered chronologically, swirling round the main hall, with a timeline at the beginning giving you not the potted history of art, but the history of the Tate itself.</p>
<h2>Sugar pots and panopticons</h2>

<p>The Tate was founded from a bequest of Henry Tate, of Tate &amp; Lyle &#8211; who also did (and do) sugar and golden syrup.</p>
<p>Like the Tate Modern, which was converted from a mid-century factory, the Tate Britain partially re-appropriates an earlier space. The Millbank Prison was originally going to be Jeremy Bentham&#8217;s pilot Panopticon, but it didn&#8217;t work out and the National Penitentary was demolished and replaced by the National Gallery of British Art &#8211; which then became the Tate.</p>
<p>Built on Henry Tate&#8217;s sugar- (which in practice means &#8216;slave-&#8216;) money, and sitting there on the site of Bentham&#8217;s prison overlooking the Thames, the Tate has always felt strangely emblematic to me.</p>
<p>Unlike the National Gallery, which has a noble heritage more akin to the great educative state institutions &#8211; the Louvre, say, or the Uffizi &#8211; the Tate has an intrinsically London spirit and a capitalist soul, with something of the Protestant Work Ethic hanging about it.</p>
<p>Indeed, today the Tate group as a whole earns over sixty percent of its income &#8211; staggering when you consider the average equivalent for its fellow UK museums is more like two to three percent.<sup><a href="/2013/06/13/womens-work-in-the-tate-britain-rehang/#footnote_0_13759" id="identifier_0_13759" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" In fact, my one gripe with this new rehang is that it has an actual, literal, break for the gift shop.

<h2>A woman&#8217;s work is never done</h2>
<p>Most of the painting interpretation has now been stripped out entirely. I always read those explanations slavishly, but I have to say I didn&#8217;t miss them at all &#8211; in fact, I barely noticed they were gone.</p>
<div id="attachment_13791" style="width: 256px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/thoughts-of-the-past.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13791" data-attachment-id="13791" data-permalink="/2013/06/13/womens-work-in-the-tate-britain-rehang/thoughts-of-the-past/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/thoughts-of-the-past.jpg?fit=351%2C599&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="351,599" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="thoughts of the past" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/thoughts-of-the-past.jpg?fit=176%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/thoughts-of-the-past.jpg?fit=351%2C599&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-13791" alt="thoughts of the past" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/thoughts-of-the-past.jpg?resize=246%2C419" width="246" height="419" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-13791" class="wp-caption-text">Thoughts of the Past (1859)</p></div>
<p>But there is a little bit in one of my favourite new rooms of the rehang &#8211; the drawing and prints room covering the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. On a preliminary drawing for John Roddam Spencer Stanhope&#8217;s alt-Pre-Raphaelite <strong>Thoughts of the Past</strong>, the curators comment on the depicted &#8216;sex worker&#8217; in her lodgings which (like the Tate) overlook the Thames.</p>
<p>Her industry is compared with that of the Thames itself, and its corruption with the corrupt contemporary society the picture implicitly comments upon.</p>
<p>What was interesting for me here was not only the correct use of the term &#8216;sex worker&#8217; (I notice that the <a title="The Tate - Stanhope, Thoughts of the Past" href="http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/stanhope-thoughts-of-the-past-n03338" target="_blank">interpretation available for the final painting on the Tate&#8217;s website</a> sticks to the more trad-Art History &#8216;prostitute&#8217;) but also the connection between her work and the city as a whole, its bustle, its trade, its work ethic.</p>
<p>This sits alongside the (for me, at least) unprecedented acknowledgment of female artists and their productions through the ages. We had Mary Beale &#8211; seventeenth century, claimed as &#8216;the first professional female English painter&#8217; &#8211; Mary Sargent Florence, Vanessa Bell, Dora Carrington, Georgina Macdonald, Mabel Nicholson and many others, all on display.</p>
<p>There was nothing of the tokenistic about this: you just casually bumped into female names in much the same way you might casually notice a few Raphaels in the Renaissance rooms at the National Gallery. They were just there.</p>
<h2>The work of painting</h2>

<p>As an example of how &#8216;women&#8217;s painting&#8217; was displayed, one particularly interesting juxtaposition for me was that of a <a title="Gwen John - Self Portrait" href="http://www.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/N/N05/N05366_10.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/john-self-portrait-n05366&amp;h=1028&amp;w=794&amp;sz=103&amp;tbnid=h8h2ZpVAc2kWhM:&amp;tbnh=100&amp;tbnw=77&amp;zoom=1&amp;usg=__csDrizstP_eTpav5ImtuX8ykb4Y=&amp;docid=zuj6q8jwatGXYM&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Us24UZXWKYKbPfrSgJgL&amp;ved=0CDYQ9QEwAQ&amp;dur=290" target="_blank">self-portrait by Gwen John</a>. It sat atop two paintings by male artists depicting female models &#8211; <a title="William Orpen - The Mirror" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/migration_catalog/article5279538.ece/ALTERNATES/w620/Sir+William+Orpen,+The+Mirror,+Oil,+1900+.jpeg" target="_blank">William Orpen&#8217;s <strong>The Mirror</strong></a> and <a title="Philip Wilson Steer - Seated Nude" href="http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/N/N05/N05261_10.jpg" target="_blank">Philip Wilson Steer&#8217;s <strong>Seated Nude</strong></a>. The choice of the John self-portrait here seemed to me to comment implicitly on the relationship between artist and model and, again, different kinds of work.</p>
<p><strong>The Mirror</strong> shows a fully-clothed female model in a large hat looking glumly out at us &#8211; except she&#8217;s not looking at us, but at William Orpen, who can be seen working at his painting in the Van Eykian mirror above her.</p>
<p>Wilson Steer&#8217;s painting shows a naked female model, also in a large hat, sitting within roughly sketched unfinished surroundings, in the process drawing attention to painting&#8217;s backstage elements, its construction.</p>
<p>Gwen John shows herself fully clothed and looking at the viewer, but she is of course painting herself modelling herself.</p>
<p>These kinds of juxtapositions really bring out some of the nuances of the &#8216;History of British Art&#8217;, and the rehang is full of them. I could also go on about the new room of 1920s silent film responding to two Pre-Raphaelite paintings; the sudden influx of craft, sculpture and 3D works, and the re-instatement of the glorious Blake collection.</p>
<p>And other reviewers have talked at length about the choice to spread a single artist over multiple rooms, so you see the same artist appearing and reappearing at different points throughout the journey, depending on where you are chronologically. I won&#8217;t talk about it forever &#8211; I&#8217;ll just suggest that you go and see it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Hitchcock&#8217;s <strong>Psycho</strong> came out in 1960, its shower scene was instantly a sensation. Three minutes and fifty cuts, it broke rules previously sacrosanct: for starters, coming about forty minutes into the film, it killed off Janet Leigh, the film&#8217;s protagonist &#8211; with whom the audience had been invited to identify from those first opening shots of her carefully nondescript underwear. Not only this, its fifty cuts served the purpose of (in the director&#8217;s own words) &#8216;transferring the menace from the screen into the mind of the audience&#8217;. Viewers were no longer the blonde; they were the psycho. An uncomfortable shift.</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/psycho.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="13364" data-permalink="/2013/03/18/the-shower-scene-in-silver-linings-playbook/psycho/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/psycho.jpg?fit=492%2C755&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="492,755" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="psycho" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/psycho.jpg?fit=195%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/psycho.jpg?fit=492%2C755&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignleft  wp-image-13364" alt="psycho" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/psycho.jpg?resize=194%2C297" width="194" height="297" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>In <strong>Silver Linings Playbook</strong>, the menace is all in in the mind &#8211; it&#8217;s a film about mental illness. It is presumably for this reason that director David O. Russell has chosen to reproduce that shower scene in it &#8211; though, represented via a series of individual flashbacks, he&#8217;s added some more visceral cuts into it, as well as a middle-aged professor who&#8217;s having an affair with this Norman Bates&#8217;s wife.</p>
<p>The film follows Pat (Bradley Cooper), who is bipolar, and his quest to get his marriage back together after returning home from a psychiatric hospital. We learn that his most recent breakdown was precipitated on discovering his wife Nikki in the aforementioned shower with a colleague; he attacked the man, which brought him up against assault charges and eventually landed him in the institution. Back home at the beginning of the film, Pat wants to get Nikki, and his marriage, back &#8211; despite his continuing mood swings, refusal to take medication and restraining order.</p>
<p>Then he meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a young woman whose husband has recently died in traumatic circumstances. She is similarly Troubled (she&#8217;s been fired for sleeping with all her co-workers) and they hit it off, in a vague way. She agrees to take a letter to Nikki if Pat will partner her in a dance competition.</p>
<p>The inevitable happens.</p>

This one brings plenty of opportunities for personal development, which &#8211; though not so pronounced as the ur-dance movies &#8211; is actually why Pat agrees to do it: he wants to prove to Nikki that he has changed, and grown, since the shower incident. Cinematic history tells him this is the way to do it.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, in <strong>Silver Linings Playbook</strong>, development through dance is not really the point: the dancing pops up towards the second half of the film, and while the rehearsals do force the characters to spend a lot of time doing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MN9Khh_K2s" target="_blank">semi-erotic stuff</a> together, it&#8217;s not the primary impetus behind their falling in love.</p>
<p>Indeed, if you accept that dance in golden-era Hollywood is usually implied sex<sup><a href="/2013/03/18/the-shower-scene-in-silver-linings-playbook/#footnote_0_13042" id="identifier_0_13042" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" Considerably less &lsquo;implied&rsquo; in the 1980s, as with the eponymous moves of&nbsp;Dirty Dancing. ">1</a></sup>, often in the context of romantic relationships between show-people who dance as part of their job (here, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFqFMxIeeU0" target="_blank">Fred Astaire tries to win Ann Miller back as his g/f by getting her to do the dance they perform on stage</a>), you could say that <strong>Silver Linings </strong>is less about sex than it is about Feelings.</p>
<p>Feelings (that&#8217;s a capital F), are by contrast the preserve of the classic romcom, which &#8211; a true product of the Eighties &#8211; features extended, over-analytical examinations of the Self. It&#8217;s Hugh Grant and Woody Allen being neurotic and too self-aware; it&#8217;s realising you&#8217;re in love just in time to run down an aeroplane. It&#8217;s the power of the mind &#8211; its hopes, fears and wants &#8211; to overcome practical obstacles. And in <strong>Silver Linings Playbook</strong>, as I say, it&#8217;s all about the mind. It&#8217;s a romcom for the post-Hugh Grant generation, if you will.</p>
<p>Now, personally, I didn&#8217;t find the treatment of mental health as offensive as I know some did &#8211; David O. Russell has commented in interviews that he drew a lot from the experience of having a son with bipolar disorder, which does help. One thing that did bug me, though, was its pairing of a bipolar man with longstanding mental health issues with a hypersexual woman recovering from a traumatic bereavement. Pat&#8217;s problems are longstanding, but Tiffany&#8217;s troubles clearly have their origin in grief, and they happen to manifest themselves in a pattern of sexual behaviour that, as recounted, elicits visible salivation from her male companion. We might say, in fact, that in this film, there is Serious Mental Illness, and there is Sexy Mental Illness. That Pat&#8217;s initial crime puts him in the cinematic shoes of Norman Bates, whose murder is at root sexually motivated &#8211; though it is repeated here as a grotesque husband-on-lover attack &#8211; underscores this, though admittedly at one remove.</p>
<p>This is why the <strong>Psycho</strong> crib, for me, was a key moment &#8211; and partly because its appearance in the film is so downright weird. It parallels the dance competition trope as an interjection of popular film history, but I suppose it also draws together some of the film&#8217;s key themes: notably, though arguably ironically, psychosis (Hitchcock&#8217;s film played a major part in popularising the slang word <em>psycho</em>) and what you might very crudely call Hollywood &#8216;monster-cam&#8217;.</p>
<p>I suppose one reason for including the scene (something I spent a long time puzzling over) was that, by putting the audience in the eye-view of a man mid-breakdown unleashing his rage upon two people who happen to be naked (and one of them a woman) shows the terrible power of the mental threats the film explores: we see their vulnerability, and we are invited to consider the gender issues the attack brings to the surface. Within the context of the plot, it makes sense of Nikki&#8217;s need for a restraining order and perhaps even makes an ironic comment on the thigh-rubbing Hitchcock is widely accepted to have been doing throughout his own shower scene. It certainly makes you think back to the portrayal of mental illness in the deeply exploitative <strong>Psycho</strong>. In that sense, <strong>Silver Linings Playbook</strong> actually comes out reasonably well.</p>
<p>So, should you go and see it? I&#8217;d imagine if you were going to, you&#8217;ll have done so by now. But I think it&#8217;s worth seeing &#8211; despite those dodgy gender politics, it certainly makes you think.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[When people talk about art changing lives, I think Raven Kaliana’s work is the kind of thing they mean.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When people talk about art changing lives, I think <a href="http://ravenkaliana.com/"><strong>Raven Kaliana</strong></a>’s work is the kind of thing they mean. Using a mixture of live actors and puppetry, her company <a href="http://puppetrevolution.co.uk/index.html"><strong>Puppet (R)Evolution</strong></a> uses ingenious staging to show what cannot be shown in live action.</p>
<p>The first play of Kaliana’s I saw was <a href="http://hoorayforhollywood.co.uk/"><strong>Hooray for Hollywood</strong></a> a while back. It told the story of her own horrific childhood in the child sex industry. The play showed adult actors from the waist down (just jean legs, skirts and overheard dialogue) and focused on the level – both emotionally and physically – of the children, who were portrayed with puppets.</p>
<p>I first saw <strong>Hooray for Hollywood</strong> in July 2010 and wrote about it then <a href="http://www.fat-quarter.co.uk/archives/1454">for feminist mag <strong>Fat Quarter</strong></a>. More recently an abridged version of the play has been filmed for wider distribution and showed at an event on ending child pornography held at Amnesty International Headquarters. The work is powerful, brave, and through ingenious staging conveys what it would be near-impossible to bring out for open discussion any other way. Frequently <strong>Hooray for Hollywood</strong> is played with a talk afterwards, hosted by various child protection charities.</p>
<p>Puppet (R)Evolution’s current play, <strong>Fragile/Sacred</strong>, was on as part of the <a href="http://www.suspensefestival.com/content/home"><strong>Suspense</strong> puppetry festival</a>.</p>
<p><iframe width="480" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/wSTlozej9NI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Whereas <strong>Hooray for Hollywood</strong> was already an extremely creatively-presented play, <strong>Fragile/Sacred</strong> pushes the boundary further and forms more of an art piece. Once again part of Kaliana’s autobiography, and drawing this time from her teens, the entire performance is wordless, and uses four live actors along with a minimal number of puppets.</p>

Image by Emma Leishman, shared under Fair Use guidelines." title="fragilesacred-0" width="285" height="185" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-8488" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>The set is a large, square tunnel – with each side draped in a different material, used to great effect to convey everything from undergrowth to water to a hospital ward. The opening sequence of the abusive father figure holding a light-up model of a home and pushing his hand into it and licking his hand &#8211; clearly getting a sexual kick out of it – set up the creepiness of the story&#8217;s homelife, and was one of the most uncomfortable few minutes of stagetime I have ever seen.</p>
<p>I feel I very much benefited from seeing <strong>Hooray for Hollywood</strong> first, and feel the two plays could, perhaps, complement each other on a double-bill. As it was, I’m not sure if those coming to <strong>Fragile/Sacred</strong> afresh would have understood all of it.</p>
<p>However, that said, the play is as much about atmosphere as it is about plot. The father figure character (opening scene aside) is oddly inexpressive – tightly-wound and capable of violence, but the actor playing him nonetheless gives little away facially.  I say ‘the actor’ as the part is also sometimes played by a puppet for the longer-range scenes.</p>

It has a father puppet, a rabbit and a raven, as well as some shadow-puppets, but the play also makes good use of models and toys to convey the larger scenes. Puppetry in this play is just one element in a large range of innovative techniques used to convey the story.</p>
<p>Watching adult actors move toy cars or toy helicopters around added a layer of non-optional make-believe to the production. I occasionally found the lines between characters playing and representation of wider plot a little difficult to discern, but that in a way added to the dreamlike quality of the piece.  </p>
<p>I found the complete lack of dialogue a little difficult, but – as in the earlier play – this is about a protagonist who sees a lot, but is often scared to speak or act. The character seemed on the surface to be very passive, yet was making brave and bold moves throughout the play.  The dreamlike quality of the production conveyed a kind of inner sanctuary that the protagonist retreated to and drew strength from.</p>
<p>A fascinating, artful and thoughtful production – and an absolute must for lovers of physical theatre, as well as anyone working in fields which touch on the themes of abuse. But, strange as it feels to say, I found <strong>Fragile/Sacred</strong> &#8211; the gentler of the two plays I&#8217;ve seen &#8211;  was slightly more difficult for me than <strong>Hooray for Hollywood</strong> with its more straightforward plot. While <strong>Hooray for Hollywood</strong> was entirely viewed from the protagonist’s (physical) point of view, <strong>Fragile/Sacred</strong> seems to be viewed from mostly inside the protagonist’s mind, where there is an often luscious stillness while horrors swirl around her and worlds blend together.  That said, the two pieces do inform each other hugely, and I repeat my call for a double-bill.</p>
