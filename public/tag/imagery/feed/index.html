										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Image is important. Sad but true. And it is widely held that feminism has an image problem. I thought I’d do some of my famous research into what the internet says feminism looks like.</p>
<p>This is an exciting web 3.0 INTERACTIVE post, rather than one that&#8217;s full of pictures, because of copyright licensing laws. When you hear this noise &#8211; <strong>*ping!*</strong> &#8211; click the link and hopefully the search results will open in a new window for you to enjoy.</p>
<h3>Google Images</h3>
<p>*<a title="Google Image search results for feminism" href="http://www.google.co.uk/images?hl=en&amp;source=imghp&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=583&amp;q=feminism&amp;btnG=Search+Images&amp;gbv=2&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=" target="_blank">ping!</a>*</p>
<p>Google provide personalized search results of course, so what you see when you Google images of feminism is probably different from what I’m seeing. But what I got is for the most part old favourites, and mostly images created by or appropriated by the feminist movement. I love these pictures. But they are getting kind of old:</p>

<li>Rosie the Riveter (what are we going to do when the 1940s aren’t fashionable anymore?)</li>
<li>“If I had a hammer… I’d SMASH patriarchy” <a title="If I had a hammer graphic" href="http://images.suite101.com/562849_com_feminism12.png">graphic</a> (a proto-<a title="Twitter - Feminist Hulk" href="http://twitter.com/feministhulk">Feminist Hulk</a>? SMASH!)</li>
<li>The      female symbol with fist – actually a little alarming when you think about <strong>why</strong> that symbol represents the female.  Punching wombs for equality!</li>
<li>Various classic slogans on t-shirts, badges and banners</li>
<li>Pictures of Women’s Liberation marches</li>
<li>The ‘<a title="Look Kitten feminist cartoon" href="http://www.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_11-nzoYFuQU/S-y0QD31sPI/AAAAAAAAG-k/YKrGeGeFwHA/s1600/feminist.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://telling-secrets.blogspot.com/2010_05_01_archive.html&amp;usg=__T1g3m9a7wcBxSrbi8PE7uoSWdRM=&amp;h=595&amp;w=403&amp;sz=45&amp;hl=en&amp;start=45&amp;zoom=1&amp;tbnid=05P9RyomV7tSSM:&amp;tbnh=136&amp;tbnw=92&amp;ei=h5hzTdbZJcHd4waz0Ly5DQ&amp;prev=/images%3Fq%3Dfeminism%26hl%3Den%26safe%3Doff%26sa%3DG%26biw%3D1280%26bih%3D583%26gbv%3D2%26tbs%3Disch:10%2C971&amp;itbs=1&amp;iact=rc&amp;dur=443&amp;oei=7XdzTbvkJouwhQf_jck8&amp;page=3&amp;ndsp=20&amp;ved=1t:429,r:18,s:45&amp;tx=58&amp;ty=63&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=583">Look, kitten</a>’ cartoon</li>
<li>A      painting by Artemisia Gentileschi. It’s ‘<a title="Judith Beheading Holofernes, by Artemisia Gentileschi" href="http://schwarzemilch.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/femns_gentles-jud-behd-lg.jpg">Judith beheading Holofernes</a>’, in      fact. Bet she was a feminist too &#8211; we can’t get enough of violence against      men, apparently (more on which later)</li>
</ul>
<p>In amongst these are the anti-feminist blogger’s illustration of choice, the demotivational poster.</p>
<h3><strong>Clipart</strong></h3>
<p>*<a title="Clipart.com" href="http://www.clipart.com/en/search/split?a=a&amp;show=all&amp;k_mode=all&amp;q=feminism" target="_blank">ping!</a>*</p>
<p>These days, some people pretend to be dorky to be cool. I’m the real deal. My major love-in with clipart was at secondary school when I decided to make a school newsletter. No one would do it with me, so I wrote and laid it out and printed it and distributed it in all the classrooms by myself. There was no second issue.</p>
<p>Anyway. Clipart offerings for feminism were pretty thin on the ground, and included:</p>
<ul>
<li>A      burning bra. Sigh. It <a title="Snopes" href="http://www.snopes.com/history/american/burnbra.asp">never happened</a>, you know.</li>
<li>A      woman <a title="Clipart.com " href="http://www.clipart.com/en/close-up?o=5200454&amp;memlevel=A&amp;a=a&amp;q=feminism&amp;k_mode=all&amp;s=1&amp;e=8&amp;show=&amp;c=&amp;cid=&amp;findincat=&amp;g=&amp;cc=&amp;page=&amp;k_exc=&amp;pubid=">dressed as a man</a>! Well, in a shirt and a tie.</li>
<li>That      female symbol again.</li>
<li>A woman      with a placard.</li>
<li>Three      women in red – one in a <a title="Clipart.com - boardroom" href="http://www.clipart.com/en/close-up?o=4910620&amp;memlevel=A&amp;a=a&amp;q=feminism&amp;k_mode=all&amp;s=1&amp;e=8&amp;show=&amp;c=&amp;cid=&amp;findincat=&amp;g=&amp;cc=&amp;page=&amp;k_exc=&amp;pubid=">boardroom</a>, one in a <a title="Clipart.com - boxing ring" href="http://www.clipart.com/en/close-up?o=4909709&amp;memlevel=A&amp;a=a&amp;q=feminism&amp;k_mode=all&amp;s=1&amp;e=8&amp;show=&amp;c=&amp;cid=&amp;findincat=&amp;g=&amp;cc=&amp;page=&amp;k_exc=&amp;pubid=">boxing ring</a>, and one hefting      her <a title="Clipart.com - skating" href="http://www.clipart.com/en/close-up?o=5046801&amp;memlevel=A&amp;a=a&amp;q=feminism&amp;k_mode=all&amp;s=1&amp;e=8&amp;show=&amp;c=&amp;cid=&amp;findincat=&amp;g=&amp;cc=&amp;page=&amp;k_exc=&amp;pubid=">male skating partner</a> on high.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those women in red are just the tip of the iceberg in representations of feminism as women fighting / besting / attacking / murdering men, it turns out&#8230;</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3>Stock Photos</h3>
<p>Famously bizarre friend of the low budget publication producer, there is nothing quite like browsing cheap stock photography websites. There’s even a <a title="Awkward Stock Photos" href="http://awkwardstockphotos.com/">tumblr</a> dedicated to some of the more outlandish findings.</p>
<p>Let’s start with <strong>iStockPhoto</strong>.</p>
<p>*<a title="iStock Photo search results for feminism" href="http://www.istockphoto.com/search/text/feminism/source/basic/#1082f61b" target="_blank">ping!</a>*<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Yes, that’s right. The first image to come up under ‘feminism’ is a woman holding a gun to her sleeping partner’s head. See also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tiny      <a title="IStock Photo: Man being crushed by woman's foot" href="http://www.istockphoto.com/stock-illustration-11891575-the-boss.php">man being crushed</a> by enormous womanfoot</li>
<li>Man      <a title="IStock Photo: 'battle of the sexes' apparently" href="http://www.istockphoto.com/stock-photo-13127552-battle-of-the-sexes.php">being strangled by a woman</a>, Hammer Horror stylee</li>
<li>Woman      with boxing gloves</li>

<li>Woman      standing on a man’s chest in pose of triumph</li>
<li>Woman      treading on a man’s toe in high heels</li>
<li>Woman unconvincingly     <a title="iStock Photo: woman kicking man" href="http://www.istockphoto.com/stock-photo-15168396-businesswoman-kicking-on-the-groins-of-businessman.php">kicking a man in the groin</a></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I find this simultaneously worrying, revealing and hilarious. There we were, slogging away, trying to get recognised as a valid and powerful political movement and to assert our credibility as a critical paradigm, and it turns out all the people creating and using these images are afraid that we’re going to come and BEAT THEM UP.</p>
<p>Other things come up too, but the women-attacking-men theme is pretty striking. One notable exception is this unbelieveable piece of tastelessness: <a title="IStock Photo: Sexy woman wearing a burkha" href="http://www.istockphoto.com/stock-photo-15677001-sexy-woman-wearing-a-burkha.php">“Sexy woman wearing a Burkha”</a>.</p>
<p>On to<strong> Shutterstock</strong>, a much friendlier and sexier place, it turns out.</p>
<p>*<a title="Shutterstock search results for feminism" href="http://www.shutterstock.com/s/feminism/search-p1.html?x=0&amp;y=0&amp;search_source=search_form&amp;lang=en&amp;search_group=" target="_blank">ping!</a>*</p>
<p>There’s really too great a variety of bizarre representations of feminism here for me to summarise, but highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>One      half of a “<a title="Shutterstock - Sexy young couple" href="http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-64529791/stock-photo-portrait-of-a-sexy-young-couple.html">sexy young couple</a>” smooshing her partner’s face</li>
<li>“<a title="Shutterstock - glamour still life" href="http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-822424/stock-photo-glamor-still-life.html">Glamor      still life</a>”</li>
<li>A      serene <a title="Shutterstock - headless woman" href="http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-10311232/stock-photo-phantom-of-beautiful-elegant-woman.html">headless phantom</a> feminist</li>
<li>An <a title="Shutterstock bag" href="http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-60828085/stock-photo-brown-leather-bag.html"> old bag</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The violence against men is present, but it’s more symbolic – women are cutting or stamping on their ties – or implied: the boxing gloves are back, and this enterprising <a title="Shutterstock - rifle" href="http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-24193078/stock-photo-shot-of-a-beautiful-girl-holding-gun.html">young lady</a> has an assault rifle.</p>
<p>There are also a lot of pictures of<a title="Shutterstock model" href="http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-38354473/stock-photo-skincare-of-young-beautiful-woman-face-with-fresh-flower-over-white-background.html"> attractive models</a> looking like they can’t wait to advertise your new cleanser.</p>
<p>Not that I could ever afford to buy pictures from <strong>Getty</strong>, but I checked them too.</p>
<p>*<a title="Getty search results for feminism" href="http://www.gettyimages.co.uk/Search/Search.aspx?contractUrl=2&amp;language=en-GB&amp;family=creative&amp;p=feminism&amp;assetType=image" target="_blank">ping!</a>*</p>
<p>Popular themes seem to be men and women glaring at each other in offices, arm wrestling and tugs-of-war (also in offices) and another disturbing <a title="Getty - guns in bed" href="http://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/sb10064861ab-001/Photodisc">guns-in-bed picture</a>.</p>
<p>Last stop:</p>
<h3>Creative Commons</h3>
<p>Firstly: I love Creative Commons; it basically makes my job possible (producing decent communications materials for charities). Y’all should<a title="Creative Commons - donate" href="https://creativecommons.net/donate/"> donate</a> to support them.</p>
<p>*<a title="Flickr CC search results for feminism" href="http://search.creativecommons.org/?q=feminism#" target="_blank">ping!</a>*</p>
<p><strong>Flickr</strong> is the main place I use for CC pics, and what comes up under ‘feminism’ is on the whole just pictures of the day-to-day business of it. Panel debates, speakers, meetings, marches, placards, some cool graffiti…</p>
<p>Not especially glamorous, but less weird and less violent than what stock photography sites seem to think goes on.  For example, I couldn’t find a single picture of a sexy bride in boxing gloves punching a businessman’s head off.</p>
