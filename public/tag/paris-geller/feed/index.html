<h2>Widow imagery on &#8216;The Gilmore Girls&#8217;</h2>

Paris Geller, on the other hand – Rory Gilmore’s nemesis, love rival, roommate, co-plotter and sometime editor – also attracts ridicule as a young woman who presumes on the privileges of widowhood.</p>
<p>Her affair with her professor, the novelist Asher Fleming, is treated by most people as a slightly tacky fling between a vain older man and a naive young student. Whilst Paris drops broad hints to Rory about her grand passion (“Mmm, I smell of pipe smoke&#8230;”) it is made pretty clear to the audience that Fleming regularly has casual affairs with young women who take his course.</p>
<p>When he dies suddenly (&#8220;When he&#8230;were you&#8230;?&#8221; &#8220;No, Rory. This great man was not laid low by my vagina.&#8221;) Paris goes into mourning, and is appalled that not enough notice is being taken on campus. She takes it upon herself to hold a wake for Fleming, complete with a stack of his last book and herself in dignified black, holding court on the sofa.</p>
<p>Though Paris is not treated as cruelly as Miss Havisham, her party is marked out as the culmination of her grandiose ideas about her relationship. Behaving as Asher’s widow is another one of Paris’ obsessive eccentricities, and the scene is undercut by the appearance of a beer keg in the background by two frat boys whom Rory hurriedly shoos away.</p>
<p>Paris may believe she is enabling the community to pay their proper respects to a great man of letters, whose loss she inevitably feels most keenly, but most of the people at the party think it’s a kegger thrown by some girl they’ve never heard of.</p>
<p>It’s a funny sequence, and Paris is given an unexpected emotional weight by Liza Weil, but the narrative makes it clear she is not entitled to widowhood, and no-one grants it to her. Apart from Emily Gilmore, admittedly, which does nothing to bolster Paris’ cause.</p>
<h2>Funeral Blues</h2>
<p>This tension between people who feel like widows, and the society which refuses to legitimise their view of themselves, is given another twist in the final example I’d like to discuss: the speaker in W.H. Auden’s poem <strong>Funeral Blues</strong>.</p>
<p>Performed so memorably by John Hannah in <strong>Four Weddings and A Funeral</strong>, the poem has become one of the most famous and popular elegies in English. In its best known version, the poem runs thus:</p>
<p><em>Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone,<br />
Prevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone,<br />
Silence the pianos and with muffled drum<br />
Bring out the coffin, let the mourners come.</em></p>
<p><em>Let aeroplanes circle moaning overhead</em><br />
<em> Scribbling on the sky the message He Is Dead,</em><br />
<em> Put crepe bows round the white necks of the public doves,</em><br />
<em> Let the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves.</em></p>
<p><em>He was my North, my South, my East and West,</em><br />
<em> My working week and my Sunday rest,</em><br />
<em> My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song;</em><br />
<em> I thought that love would last for ever: I was wrong.</em></p>
<p><em>The stars are not wanted now: put out every one;</em><br />
<em> Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun;</em><br />
<em> Pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood.</em><br />
<em> For nothing now can ever come to any good.</em></p>
<p>There’s a noticeable shift between the second and third verses in the treatment of the death and its consequences. From demanding exaggerated outward ceremonies to mark the beloved’s death, the poem starts to imagine in both more personal and more cosmological terms.</p>
<p>If the first two verses concentrate on the public and social sphere (the area in which widowhood is bestowed and validated, as we have seen), the latter two are concerned with the relationship of one individual to the whole universe, and how that has been dislocated by another person’s death.</p>
<p>In both there is an anguished hyperbole, an awareness of the discrepancy between the speaker’s own feelings and the way the rest of the world sees the matter. The irony of the lines about the pigeons and the sun are directed inwards, sketching the speaker’s recognition of their lack of proportion alongside a refusal to countenance the idea that proportion is possible any more.</p>
<p>In some ways, it captures Olivia and Paris’ situation from both their own perspective and that of the audience watching them.</p>
<p>That pivot didn’t always shift the poem in this direction, however. The verses were originally composed for a play called <strong>The Ascent of F2</strong>, about a climber who dies whilst attempting a famously dangerous mountain, having been persuaded by the prospect of public glory and national pride. His lover speaks the lines, which share the first two verses with the later version, but then veer off like this:</p>
<p><em>Hold up your umbrellas to keep off the rain<br />
From Doctor Williams while he opens a vein;<br />
Life, he pronounces, it is finally extinct.<br />
Sergeant, arrest that man who said he winked!</em></p>
<p><em>Shawcross will say a few words sad and kind</em><br />
<em> To the weeping crowds about the Master-mind,</em><br />
<em> While Lamp with a powerful microscope</em><br />
<em> Searches their faces for a sign of hope.</em></p>
<p><em>And Gunn, of course, will drive a motor-hearse:</em><br />
<em> None could drive it better, most would drive it worse.</em><br />
<em> He’ll open up the throttle to its fullest power</em><br />
<em> And drive him to the grave at ninety miles an hour.</em></p>
<p>The satire here is more obvious, and directly develops the first two verses’ slanted glance at the public commemoration of a death. They’re more clearly about the uselessness of marking someone’s funeral with great pomp, without being so specific about the internal emotional world which is being contrasted with those rituals.</p>
<p>Auden reworked the poem as part of a collection of cabaret songs for the singer Heidli Anderson. I find it difficult to read <strong>Funeral Blues</strong>, in the light of its earlier appearance (and alongside the other songs), without finding an implication that the singer is mourning a dead politician she had an affair with.</p>
<p>The pivot in the middle, from this angle, marks the shift between her satirical comments on the grandiose ceremonies accorded him, and her insistence that the person he really mattered to won’t be recognised during them.</p>
<h2>The politics of widowhood</h2>
<p>John Hannah’s performance of the poem during the funeral scene of Richard Curtis’ movie brings out this reading strongly. Putting <strong>Funeral Blues</strong> in the mouth of a gay man mourning his partner shows up the political dimension of the issue of who is regarded as someone’s &#8220;widow&#8221;.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/b_a-eXIoyYA" height="315" width="420" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>The lines’ scorn for the rituals and regulations of public grief map provocatively across the character’s situation, legally barred from being recognised as the surviving spouse.</p>
<p>Anxieties around widowhood – and non-widowhood – are a recurring feature of literary history, taking various forms but often expressing the fears of a dominant group that they are losing the ability to define and control other people’s identities.</p>
<p>We might be tempted to mock the anxiety of medieval, early modern and Victorian societies who were so anxious to police the status of widowhood, and so strenuously exerted cultural authority stop people whom they imagined wanted to “play” at being widows. But there are articles and speeches being written right now in response to the prospect of equal marriage, which engage repugnantly in the same task.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I once spent three years researching a particular widow, on and off.</p>
<p>The Duchess at the centre of John Webster&#8217;s play <strong>The Duchess of Malfi</strong> (1612-13) acquires a lot of her edginess in the original play from the fact that her husband has died before the action begins. She is a young – and according to her brother Ferdinand, &#8220;lusty&#8221; – widow, whose combination of financial independence and sexual experience makes many in her vicinity nervous.</p>
<p>The equivalent man would be called &#8220;eligible&#8221;, and receive a lot of invitations from women with marriageable daughters. But a woman in the same situation becomes the subject of a campaign of surveillance and torture which ends in her death.</p>

She’s an extreme case, admittedly: few other fictional widows end up eating apricots grown in horse dung, kissing the severed hand of their husband or being strangled on the orders of their lycanthropic and potentially incestuous twin brother.</p>
<p>But a continual low charge hums around widows, from the comic grotesque of Widow Twankey to the alluringly threatening Black Widows of gangster novels. Via the Wife of Bath, the Dowager Duchess of Grantham and Aouda from <strong>Eighty Days Around The World</strong>, to take a handful nearly at random.</p>
<p>Of course it alters across the eras, but time and time again, the figure of the widow acts as a focus for drama.</p>
<p>Sometimes the charge seems to derive from the fact that she is no longer dependent upon any man, or socially &#8220;explained&#8221; via her relationship to a father or husband. Sometimes it comes instead from the way a widow is seen as <em>over</em>-defining herself in relation to a man no longer present.</p>
<p>Either way, widows in literature often hold the potential to disrupt social order in a variety of ways.</p>
<h2>Widows and Pseudowidows</h2>
<p>This article, however, is not about widows. It is about women who are <em>not</em> widows. Or rather, women who aren’t widows whilst still looking, sounding, or acting like them.</p>
<p>When considering famous widows in literature, it struck me that two of the names that sprang to mind – Miss Havisham in Dickens&#8217;s <strong>Great Expectations</strong> and Olivia in Shakespeare&#8217;s <strong>Twelfth Night</strong> – don’t technically fit the criteria.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/missh.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="13848" data-permalink="/2013/10/22/veiled-threats-widows-and-pseudowidows-12/missh/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/missh.jpg?fit=620%2C413&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="620,413" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="missh" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/missh.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/missh.jpg?fit=620%2C413&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright  wp-image-13848" alt="missh" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/missh.jpg?resize=372%2C248" width="372" height="248" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Miss Havisham’s veil is worn to mourn the marriage that never happened, whilst Olivia’s is to remind her of her dead brother, whose memory stops her from wanting to receive suitors. Nonetheless, they both look to me as if they’re trying to take on the role, adopting some of the characteristics associated with grieving spouses.</p>
<p>They wear specific clothes to mark their separation from other people (and from their previous selves), withdraw from normal social life, and refuse to put themselves under the jurisdiction of men. Neither are exactly successful in their attempt to construct themselves positively within the role of a widow.</p>
<p>Miss Havisham has become an icon of &#8220;frustrated&#8221; and &#8220;twisted&#8221; womanhood, unsuccessful within the novel’s plot and the butt of jokes in subsequent culture. She becomes a “tragic” figure in both the classical and slang senses of the word: an image of wronged heroism in her own mind, and a sad bitter spinster to the world outside.</p>
<p>Her veil, usually a temporary garment to mark her passing between two states, becomes a fixture, blending with the cobwebs which now cover her wedding cake. In Miss Havisham, Dickens created a figure who memorably combines the revulsion and anxiety felt by Victorian (and later) society towards women who refuse to play out the social roles ascribed to them.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Charles_Robert_Leslie_Olivia.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="13846" data-permalink="/2013/10/22/veiled-threats-widows-and-pseudowidows-12/charles_robert_leslie_olivia/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Charles_Robert_Leslie_Olivia.jpg?fit=474%2C599&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="474,599" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Charles_Robert_Leslie,_Olivia" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Charles_Robert_Leslie_Olivia.jpg?fit=237%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Charles_Robert_Leslie_Olivia.jpg?fit=474%2C599&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright  wp-image-13846" alt="Charles_Robert_Leslie,_Olivia" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Charles_Robert_Leslie_Olivia.jpg?resize=284%2C359" width="284" height="359" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Olivia from <strong>Twelfth Night</strong> is similarly associated with a veil, at least at the beginning of the play. The first thing we hear about her is that for seven years the world “Shall not behold her face at ample view/ But, like a cloistress, she will veiled walk&#8230;all this to season/ A brother’s dead love, which she would keep fresh/ And lasting in her memory”.</p>
<p>When Viola (dressed as the male Cesario) manages to speak to her, Olivia prepares by putting her veil back on, setting up the comedy by-play in which Viola claims not to know who the lady of the house is, and the moment when Olivia pulls it back and demands “Look you, sir, such a one I was this present. Is’t not well done?”</p>
<p>Within the first act the grieving Olivia’s attempt to seclude herself is defeated by a combination of plot and Viola’s rhetorical skills. The play treats her mourning as one of the restrictive, self-imposed roles which so many of the characters are trapped in as the action begins. Orsino is locked into his schtick as self-obsessed Petrarchan lover, Sir Toby as the party knight who slinks home in the early hours of every morning, Malvolio as the image of Puritan rectitude and Olivia as the grieving veiled figure wandering inconsolably around her rooms as if her husband had just died.</p>
<p>These roles are all disrupted for the audience’s amusement and the characters’ correction during the ensuing scenes, with the play particularly conspiring to trick Olivia out of her image of herself as a grand widow. There’s an echo here of Miss Havisham, though in a very different key: women are not permitted to adopt the role of widow simply because they want to.</p>
<p>Both characters are diverted away from a successful performance as “pseudowidows” by the narratives in which they appear: Olivia to happy marriage and Miss Havisham to pathological bitterness and mockery.</p>
<h2>&#8216;A veil of wickedness&#8217;</h2>
<p>In fact we don’t have to rely on my close-reading of these fictional texts to find anxiety around women “playing” at being widows. That harping on Olivia wearing a veil and walking secluded from men “like a cloistress” brings another group of women into play, whose apparent freedom from male jurisdiction has produced anger and revulsion in various eras.</p>
<p>I don’t have space to examine the way in which nuns in the Middle Ages navigated the rhetoric of “brides of Christ” alongside the reality that many entered the community after the death of a husband, or their social position. But one particular case stands out amongst the criticism of female religious orders: the bishop of Olmüt’s attack on the Beguines.</p>
<p>These women, who lived together in small self-governing groups, taking few vows and following the Rule of no specific order, were the subject of a lot of criticism in the later thirteenth century. Bruno, the bishop in question, wrote to the pope in 1273 to demand they be suppressed.</p>
<p>In R.W. Southern’s words:</p>
<blockquote><p>he complained that&#8230;the women used their liberty as a veil of wickedness in order to escape the yoke of obedience to their priests and ‘the coercion of marital bonds’. Above all, he was indignant that young women should assume the status of widowhood against the authority of the Apostle who approved no widows under the age of sixty.</p></blockquote>
<p>The bishop was referring to verses in the New Testament book of 1 Timothy, in which instructions are given for the way the “order of widows” should be run and who should be admitted. These women, who worked for the church and were provided with support, should all be over the age of sixty, have a good reputation and previously carried out pious works.</p>
<p>Obviously “widow” has a technical significance in this Biblical passage, but I was fascinated by Bruno’s line of attack: that the young women of the Beguines were setting themselves up <em>as if</em> they were widows, and thus escaping male authority.</p>
<p>His metaphor of a &#8220;veil of wickedness&#8221; once again acts as a focus for male anxiety over women who won’t accept their assigned role.</p>
<p>In part two of this post, I&#8217;ll delve into widow imagery in modern TV and film, including <strong>The Gilmore Girls</strong> and <strong>Four Weddings and a Funeral</strong>.</p>
