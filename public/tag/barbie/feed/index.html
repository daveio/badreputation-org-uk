					<description><![CDATA[Like most of the Disney Renaissance heroines, hers is the story of a successful transition from the rule of the father to the rule of the husband. But how did we get to something so squeaky-clean? ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li><em><strong>Ed&#8217;s Note:</strong> This post is partly in honour of <a href="http://poemsunderwater.wordpress.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Poems Underwater</strong></a>, a new project on the symbolism of the mermaid our Hodge is involved with, which you are hereby urged to check out (and perhaps <a href="http://poemsunderwater.wordpress.com/contribute/" target="_blank">contribute</a> to, as it has a zine and everything!).</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Released in 1989, Disney’s <strong>The Little Mermaid</strong> heralded the start of the ‘Disney Renaissance’ – a period of critical and commercial success that followed a rocky patch where the studio’s prime focus had been on Disneyland attractions rather than feature films.</p>
<p>It was soundtracked by <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/beauty-and-the-plague" target="_blank">Broadway golden boy Howard Ashman</a>, who changed the planned English butler crab into a Jamaican crustacean named Sebastian, and reworked the film’s structure to more closely align with that of a Broadway musical. He also decided to base Ursula the Sea Witch on drag artist and disco star <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_(performer)" target="_blank">Divine</a> (who died whilst the film was still in production).</p>
<p>Ashman died of AIDS two years later, in March 1991, but his musical influence, first on <b>Mermaid</b>, and subsequently on <strong>Beauty and the Beast</strong> and <strong>Aladdin</strong>, was a major factor in the regeneration of the studio in the early nineties. <strong>Mermaid</strong> won Oscar gongs for Best Song and Best Score, the first Oscar nod for Disney since the Seventies.</p>
<h2>Mermaids of the Eighties</h2>

<p>The Disney studio had been considering Hans Christian Andersen’s <b>The Little Mermaid </b>for adaptation as early as the <strong>Snow White</strong> years, but it was not until the late Eighties that the time finally seemed right. Even then, there was concern it might too closely duplicate <b>Splash</b>, which Disney had produced in 1984.</p>
<p><strong>Splash</strong> itself had been rushed through production because there were rumours of another mermaid film in the pipeline elsewhere – a Warren Beatty vehicle that eventually fell through. Why exactly mermaids were suddenly in the ascendant during this particular period of the late twentieth century is open to speculation; at any rate, the nudity and adult content in <strong>Splash</strong> led directly to the creation of Touchstone Pictures, Disney’s ‘older audiences’ label. Mermaids (particularly Darryl Hannah&#8217;s mermaid) were too sexual for the family studio in 1984.</p>
<p>Ironically, of course, <em>mermaid</em> &#8211; “maiden of the sea” – suggests that these aquatic women are rather more virginal than ‘Touchstone Pictures’ thought. Traditional (cisnormative) misogynistic popular wisdom holds women in general to be ‘leaky vessels’, because of the amount of ‘moisture’ they produce, but though mermaids live in the water, they have no apparent human genitalia, making them, by contrast, vessels that are rather neatly sealed.</p>
<p>In this, they link with the Virgin Mary, who appears in Catholic symbolism as a ‘fountain forever sealed’ in the middle of an enclosed garden, representing the Immaculate Conception. Mary’s homonymic (and virginal) association with mermaids, and the link between the sea (<em>mer</em>) and the mother (<em>mere</em>) introduces an additional layer to this.</p>
<p>Alongside this, there is also a parallel virgin/whore tradition of the mermaid as prostitute and even embodied vagina (since, famously, vaginas are often described as smelling like fish).</p>

<p>This opposing strand presumably comes from sailors’ fear of the Siren-figure and the unknowns out in the sea, but it’s also connected with a different type of mermaid altogether – the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/patia/2610080360/" target="_blank">melusine</a>. A double-tailed half-woman, half-fish, her intrinsic, though hidden, fishiness only emerges when she takes a bath. Even then, the double tail leaves her human genitalia open to the world in what <a href="http://www.endicott-studio.com/jMA03Summer/theMermaid.html">some have claimed</a> is an appropriation of older symbols of female fertility, such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheela_na_gig">Sheela na gig</a> or even the goddess Venus (an alternative ‘mother’ connection).</p>
<p>Incidentally the melusine, not the mermaid, is the figure in the (now closely cropped) logo for Starbucks coffee, the first branch of which opened &#8211; logo blazing proud, bare-breasted and double-tailed &#8211; in 1971, a decade before <strong>Splash</strong> went into production.</p>
<p>The coffee-shop melusine was maintained in her full glory until 1987 (although she was &#8216;sealed&#8217; at the point where the tails meet, <a href="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3129/2610080360_b4d8ba0e2d.jpg" target="_blank">as her original had not been</a>); the first of several censoring crops came into effect around the time Disney bosses turned their attention to Andersen.</p>
<p>For a modern contrast to the &#8216;sealed off&#8217; melusine, have a look at one of the <a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/lynxmermaid3.jpg" target="_blank">mermaids commissioned by men&#8217;s deodorant brand Lynx for an early Noughties advertising campaign</a>, whose posterior is beginning to resurface through her scales, soft porn-like.</p>
<h2>Planning The Little Mermaid</h2>
<p>Hans Christian Andersen’s original <strong>Little Mermaid</strong> tale was serviceable, but – much like Starbucks’ logo – it had to be sanitised before Disney could take it to a Disney audience. Tellingly, the changes proposed during this period of pre-production were substantially same as the ones suggested during the preliminary work in the Thirties.</p>

<p>The first thing to do was give it a happy ending, since in Andersen’s version the Prince’s indifference to the mermaid <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/05/09/fairy-tale-fest-the-best-adaptation-of-the-little-mermaid-ive-ever-seen/" target="_blank">results in her annihilation</a> and transformation to ‘a daughter of the air’.</p>
<p>This was typical Andersen: he wrote that ‘most of what I have written is a reflection of myself’, and he was not a terribly happy man. Unreciprocated love was an ongoing feature of his life, and throughout it he nursed passions for various inappropriate people.</p>
<p>These included celebrity soprano Jenny Lind (who is said to have inspired his story <strong>The Nightingale</strong> after she put him firmly in the friendzone in 1844) and various straight men, but he also wrote of avoiding actual sexual encounters – his diary records him visiting prostitutes, talking to them, and then returning home to masturbate alone.</p>
<p>Many of his ‘fairy tales’ are characterised by violence, speechlessness and unreciprocated love, often across two different ‘species’, as with the tin soldier’s love for a paper ballerina in <strong>The Steadfast Tin Soldier</strong>, or indeed the Little Mermaid’s love for the human Prince – a feature that tends to make them, like their author, rather sexless in approach.</p>
<p>Although the sad stuff was scrapped, the symbolically significant speechlessness of the Mermaid was maintained in the Disney screenplay. A mermaid’s voice is her primary power, since her singing can lure sailors to their deaths, so its loss is a significant one – aphonia in a milder form had also been a feature of <strong>Splash</strong>, where Darryl Hannah’s character cannot initially speak English.</p>
<p>Disney’s Ariel was voiced by Broadway star (and Ashman associate) Jodi Benson, and her voice remains her defining beauty in the film. But the manner of its loss changes: while both Little Mermaids give their voices up to the Sea Witch, in Andersen&#8217;s story the unnamed mermaid has her tongue cut out to bring this about. Disney cleaned this up, and, in the process, rendered it reversible: Ariel’s voice is depicted as a glowing, ghostly ball that can pass through bodily barriers without drawing blood – as in traditional artistic representations of the soul.</p>
<p>Ironically, this is exactly what Andersen’s mermaid is seeking: her love for the prince is the means through which she hopes to win ‘immortality’ and the chance to share in the joys of paradise. (This rather Romantic notion, albeit gender-inverted, links Andersen’s tale thematically with Friedrich de la Motte’s mermaid <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undine_(novella)" target="_blank"><strong>Undine</strong></a> &#8211; and also Tchaikovsky’s watery <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swan_Lake" target="_blank"><strong>Swan Lake</strong></a>, composed in 1875, the year Andersen died). Disney refocused the mermaid&#8217;s longing for a soul to a more secular – and sexualised – teenage quest for the love of a handsome prince.</p>
<h2>She sells sea shells</h2>
<p>But Disney hit a problem when it came to the artwork. Mermaids, of course, are typically bare-breasted, but so too were traditional depictions of Andersen’s ‘little’ mermaid, including the statue in Copenhagen’s harbour.</p>

<p>There is not a single illustration to the fairy tale pre-Disney that shows her wearing anything at all over her chest – in the case of Heath Robinson, <a href="http://sforsnail.blogspot.co.uk/2012/02/little-mermaid.html" target="_blank">this emphasises the ‘Little’ part</a>, as the mermaid is clearly a child in his illustrations.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ariel.jpeg"><img data-attachment-id="13567" data-permalink="/2013/04/29/undressing-the-little-mermaid-disney-adapts-andersen/ariel/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ariel.jpeg?fit=299%2C168&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="299,168" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="ariel" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ariel.jpeg?fit=299%2C168&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ariel.jpeg?fit=299%2C168&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright  wp-image-13567" alt="Disney's Ariel" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ariel.jpeg?resize=269%2C151" width="269" height="151" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>The mermaid is fifteen in Andersen’s tale, so her littleness could be argued either way, but in 1989 Disney producers obviously decided they wanted her to be legal (in most states anyway). To make it completely clear, in the course of the film Ariel declares to her father (a familiar refrain) &#8216;I&#8217;m sixteen years old. I&#8217;m not a child.&#8217;</p>
<p>But however innocently naked (and animated) the Little Mermaid might be, Disney certainly could not show a sixteen year old’s breasts on screen. Their solution to this problem was the creation of a purple bra made out of shells &#8211; a new mermaid first.</p>
<p>When coupled with the waistband-like arrangement at the top of her tail (another innovation, since traditionally the mermaid’s scales segue gradually from the skin at her waist), this decision had the effect of creating a kind of mermaid bikini that implies she might just be wearing an elaborate two-piece – one very similar, in fact, to the <a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Jasmine.jpg" target="_blank">ensemble worn by Princess Jasmine</a> in Disney’s next film, <strong>Aladdin</strong>. And, of course, it also has the effect of emphasising breasts and hips either side of a tiny waist.</p>
<p>The Barbie-style Ariel doll I had as a child had (as modern-day packaging still asserts) &#8216;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Disney-Princess-Ariel-Doll---/dp/B003V02BOO/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1365004666&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=ariel+doll" target="_blank">removable clothes for costume change</a>&#8216;, so it was clear she was a two-legged being with an optional tail.</p>
<p>This has the effect of making the transition from mermaid to human much easier: in Andersen’s story, creating two legs out of one fish tail is exactly as vicious as you would expect it to be, and the draught the mermaid drinks to effect this causes the sensation of ‘a two-edged sword [passing] through her delicate body’ – so severe she passes out. Throughout her subsequent time on land, each foot she puts to the ground feels like ‘treading upon the points of needles or sharp knives’.</p>
<p>Bodily mutilation – indeed, mortification – is everywhere in Andersen&#8217;s story. After everyone is asleep, the mermaid goes to ‘sit on the broad marble steps [of the palace] for it eased her burning feet to bathe them in the cold sea-water’. Significantly &#8211; and somewhat bizarrely &#8211; such mutilation has been an ongoing problem for the Copenhagen representation of Andersen&#8217;s mermaid: the statue in the harbour has been blown up, decapitated (twice) and had its arm sawn off, in addition to many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Mermaid_(statue)#Vandalism" target="_blank">petty acts of vandalism</a> since its erection in 1913.</p>
<h2>Some liberation?</h2>
<p>By contrast with Andersen&#8217;s difficult transition, Ariel’s easy-on, easy-off fish tail and bikini bra combo not only ‘re-opens’ the traditional closed mermaid vessel, it also sexualises the teenage mermaid in a manner markedly different from anything in Andersen’s original (where the mermaid’s love is increased by knowledge of the prince’s good deeds, and her longing for a soul).</p>

<p>By censoring Ariel, Disney draws attention to her body and breasts, so she resembles a California surfer girl. The nakedness, which in earlier illustrations was straightforward and childlike, takes on an explicitly sexual edge (for more on this, have a look at this piece <a href="http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/rrMermaids.html" target="_blank">by Virginia Borges</a>).</p>
<p>The result is that Disney’s <strong>Little Mermaid</strong> becomes the straightforward tale of a sixteen-year-old struggling with her father for the right to explore her burgeoning sexuality and go out with a boy. And because she ultimately uses this right to make a good marriage (wearing <a href="http://disney-clipart.com/wedding/princesses/Wedding-Ariel-Eric-Bride-Groom.jpg" target="_blank">something strikingly similar</a> to <a href="http://www.blogcdn.com/royalwedding.aol.com/media/2011/03/princess-diana-wedding-dresses294.jpg" target="_blank">the dress worn by the equally speechless Princess Diana</a> at her 1981 marriage), Ariel makes good in the end and everyone is happy.</p>
<p>Like most of the Disney Renaissance heroines, hers is the story of a successful transition from the rule of the father to the rule of the husband.</p>
<h2>Other mermaids</h2>
<p>But it’s interesting that at the same time the producers were working on a heteronormative middle-class fantasy idea, their musical wunderkind Howard Ashman (despite dying of what, at the time, was popularly cast as a very non-family-friendly disease) was injecting some Broadway pizzazz into the soundtrack. This included the introduction of a deviantly-styled figure like Divine via the character of Ursula, the Sea Witch (though of course she is defeated, as does not happen in Andersen).</p>
<p>In fact, as the Disney Renaissance got going, the calibre of stars from distinctly non-Disney backgrounds increased: <strong>The Lion King</strong>, the Renaissance nadir, had major Broadway stars alongside A-list Hollywood stars, and the cast included black and Latino actors – something that had not even been considered back in the Forties (when Uncle Walt wanted some racial-caricature ‘Jim Crow’ figures in <strong>Dumbo</strong>, the crows were voiced by white men doing their best ‘black man’ impression instead). The staff list at the Disney studios was full of Jewish and homosexual figures like Ashman. Yet <strong>The Little Mermaid</strong> ushered in some of the most socially conservative films Disney produced. A strange duality.</p>

<p>&#8230;in a<strong> Fox News</strong> shop of all places.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a female astronaut doll.</p>
<p>Now, no doubt you&#8217;re still reeling from that the shock that Fox News &#8211; bastion of feminism-hating, Sarah Palin-supporting, &#8220;family values&#8221; madness &#8211; is fielding a toy for girls that encourages them to study science and quite literally reach for the stars.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another doozy.</p>
<p>Look closer and you will see that &#8211; pink casing aside &#8211; there&#8217;s almost no other &#8220;girlification&#8221; going on with this toy. Sure, she&#8217;s standard issue doll shaped, but wearing a very functional, non-revealing, blue and black NASA jumpsuit. Even the tagline reads as pleasingly gender neutral: &#8220;Space Crew&#8221;.</p>
<p>And to cap it all off, she&#8217;s not even blonde.</p>
<p>Unlike Barbie.</p>
<p>Who when <em>she</em> went to space looked like <a href="http://www.tace.com/items/pictures/pp28298.jpg">The Invasion of The Ghastly Metallic Pink Shoulder Pads</a> (clicky the link, but don&#8217;t say I didn&#8217;t warn you).</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m typing this, but looks like we&#8217;ve got a genuine Found Feminism from Fox News. Wonders will never cease. Feeling pretty chuffed about that, actually &#8211; it&#8217;s one thing that you can see progress being made from friends, quite another from enemies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<h6 style="text-align: center;">D</h6>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">DOLL</h2>
<blockquote><p>What fascinated Ermengarde the most was [Sara&#8217;s] fancy about the dolls who walked and talked, and who could do anything they chose when the human beings were out of the room, but who must keep their powers a secret and so flew back to their places &#8216;like lightening&#8217; when people returned to the room.</p>
<p>&#8211; Francis Hodgson Burnett, &#8216;A Little Princess&#8217;</p></blockquote>
<h3>Were he not Romeo called&#8230;</h3>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbie">Barbara Millicent Roberts</a> is actually, it turns out, called Dorothy. At least, a &#8216;Barbie doll&#8217; is a tautology, since the word &#8216;doll&#8217; itself was originally a nickname. (Rs and Ls are colloquially interchangeable, donchaknow &#8211; see also Harry/Hal, Mary/Moll.)</p>
<p>&#8216;Doll&#8217; as a name makes an early debut in renaissance drama: first as Doll Tearsheet in Shakespeare&#8217;s <strong>Henry IV</strong> and then as Doll Common in Jonson&#8217;s <strong>The Alchemist</strong>. These two draw in &#8216;Doll&#8217;s&#8217; second meaning, which assumes a &#8216;Dorothy&#8217; is so common a species as to be generic. Thus, &#8216;Doll&#8217; as a pet name is quickly expanded to indicate any female &#8216;pet&#8217;, or indeed any female &#8216;mistress&#8217; (drawing confused attention to the potentially infantalising properties of nicknames in general). Additionally, as of 1560, it could also be used to mean &#8216;the smallest or pet pig in the litter&#8217; (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte's_Web">like Wilbur</a>). But clearly there is a double edge to Dorothy&#8217;s common-ness, since &#8216;common&#8217; means &#8216;for the use of everyone&#8217; (tee hee) as well as &#8216;numerous&#8217; – something Doll Common&#8217;s character demonstrates nominally. ENTER THE PROSTITUTE.</p>
<h3>Work and Play</h3>
<p>It is only in 1700 that &#8216;Doll&#8217; loses its capital letter and acquires something of its modern sense. The dictionary defines this as &#8216;an image of a human being (commonly of a child or lady) used as a plaything; a girl&#8217;s toy-baby&#8217;. It is no longer a name, but it still stands in for something else, with a more spiritual implication in dear Shakespeare&#8217;s <strong>Romeo and Juliet</strong> (that name-obsessed play). Here, Old Capulet refers to his daughter as a &#8216;whining Mammet&#8217;, a deviant form of &#8216;Maumet&#8217; which, deriving ultimately from &#8216;Mohammed&#8217;, was a term used in medieval England to mean &#8216;a puppet, an idol, a doll&#8217;. Here lurks the second commandment, in all its thorny glory, giving an added layer to Barbie&#8217;s iconicism, not to mention the groom&#8217;s pledge to his bride in the traditional Marriage Service, &#8216;With my body I thee worship&#8217;. (I hear the clatter of toppling pedestals.)</p>

<p>It is, I must NB, definitionally <em>girls </em>who play with dolls, and there is a pleasing juxtaposition of frivolous and stern in the dictionary&#8217;s reference to &#8216;playthings&#8217; &#8230; but I cannot help but suspect that, in their initial incarnation, these &#8216;doll-babies&#8217; were occasionally also educational tools, teaching the virtues of maternal care for something smaller and weaker, sartorial elegance and grooming and presumably also some degree of etiquette – these dolls could, after all, represent all ages, and I suspect that the comparative decline of the over 18s represented in modern doll-land may also signal a movement from dolls as work to dolls as play. (Incidentally, Londoners: for more on toys&#8217; super-seriousness, go have a look at the Maritime Museum&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nmm.ac.uk/visit/exhibitions/on-display/toy-boats/">Toy Boats exhibition</a> for examples of boys&#8217; toys serving to illustrate German naval supremacy). But onwards.</p>
<p>From play to work, there&#8217;s a beautiful reference in the dictionary to &#8216;doll&#8217; used in the more modern sense when, in 1860, the journal <em>All Year Round</em> talks about the &#8216;laborious class Who earn painful bread by fashioning dolls&#8217; eyes&#8217;, which tellingly hints at the expanded manufacturing operations doll-craft represented by the mid-Victorian industrialised era – a far cry from what would presumably have been an ad-hoc domestic craft when &#8216;doll-babies&#8217; first became popular. <strong>A Little Princess</strong>, quoted above, is a story obsessed with the power of make-believe and dolls as synecdoches for real-life figures.  It features multiple references to the late-Victorian doll and the materialism she represents, including the disapproval of Sara Crewe&#8217;s family solicitor, who, on seeing what Sara dubs &#8216;The Last Doll&#8217; says sternly &#8216;A hundred pounds [&#8230;] All expensive material, and made at a Parisian modiste&#8217;s. He spent money lavishly enough, that young man&#8217;. Fans of Victorian women&#8217;s studies may think of Dickens&#8217; Mr Merdle (<em>Little Dorrit</em>) and his search, not for a wife, but for &#8216;a bosom to hang jewels upon&#8217;.</p>
<h3>Living Dolls</h3>
<p>It has taken more time than usual, but finally the leximobile screeches up outside definition number three, another Victorian usage, &#8216;doll&#8217; as &#8216;a pretty, but unintelligent or empty person&#8217;, especially, the dictionary adds, &#8216;when dressed up; also, a pretty but silly or frivolous woman&#8217;. Hence we have &#8216;a doll&#8217;s face&#8217;, which is one &#8216;conventionally pretty, but without life or expression&#8217;. Pleasingly, in this instance, it is the lifeless image of womanhood that inspires the pejorative reference to the real thing, rather than the other way round, although it gives rise to a disturbing number of aspirations in the sentient race to be &#8216;living dolls&#8217; (a quick google, and you&#8217;ll see what I mean). The dictionary even has names for this sort of thing, giving a delightful number of compound terms: thus the (tautological) worship of dolls &#8211; <em>dollatry</em>, <em>dollhood</em> – the state or condition of being like a doll, <em>dollship</em> – the personality of a doll, although it also points out that these relate primarily to &#8216;doll&#8217;s&#8217; fifth meaning, via a re-emerging &#8216;Doll Common&#8217;, as &#8216;a prostitute&#8217;. &#8216;Living dolls&#8217; may in fact also be real-life Ladies Of Easy Virtue.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8216;</em>There is much for her to do, her whole sex to deliver from the bondage of frivolity, dolldom and imbecility.&#8217;</p>
<p>-Thomas Carlyle (1795-1881), &#8216;Letters&#8217;, (undated)</p></blockquote>
<p>So, from &#8216;Dorothy&#8217; onwards, a &#8216;doll&#8217; always represents something bigger, be it a name whose full gravity cannot yet be properly appropriated, a world of humans made more comprehensible for a small child, or even a religious figure incarnated in sacrilegious form. It is the idolatry of such a representation that I find most fascinating: it gives a whole new irony to Sara Crewe&#8217;s repeated assertion that, as her father has always told her, &#8216;All women are princesses.&#8217;</p>
