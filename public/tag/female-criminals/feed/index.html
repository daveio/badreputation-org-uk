					<description><![CDATA[Now you can play as Catwoman too!  However, she appears to have fallen foul of Rule 1 of Sensible Female Armour.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As is my tendency, this is <a title="[Gamer Diary] RPG Advertising: Where Did All The Women Go?" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/05/16/gamer-diary-rpg-advertising-women/">another party I was late to</a>.  I only got <strong>Arkham Asylum</strong> in late October last year as a gift in a <a title="Steam" href="http://store.steampowered.com" target="_blank">Steam</a> sale – it was only a fiver – and I had previously been rather sceptical about it.  Nevertheless, I played through it and found it very refreshing as a game – very noir, good combat, puzzles to solve and places to explore – and the storyline was interesting, as was the inclusion of so many Batman baddies.  Basically, in short, I loved it.</p>
<p>Mostly.</p>
<p><a title="Batman Wiki: Harley Quinn" href="http://batman.wikia.com/wiki/Harley_Quinn_(Batman:_Arkham_Asylum)" target="_blank">Harley Quinn</a> and <a title="Batman Wiki: Poison Ivy" href="http://batman.wikia.com/wiki/Poison_Ivy_(Batman:_Arkham_Asylum)" target="_blank">Poison Ivy</a> were the issues.  I don’t want to sound like a broken record but boobs on display in a high risk profession such as being a Gotham City criminal is not exactly clever – is it?  Harley was very nice to see as a significant part of the story that is out to scupper your plans, but her being called some less-than-charming things by the Joker’s own thugs was tedious to say the least, and when you actually fight Harley <em>herself</em> she is defeated ridiculously easily &#8211; in a cutscene no less.  Disappointing.</p>

It&#8217;d be terribly inconvenient and I might have to reconsider my outfit!&#8221;</p></div>
<p>Ivy, when you first meet her, is lounging about in her cell – apparently the only female inmate – not wearing prison issues but her own clothes displaying her sizeable bust.  Later, in her boss fight, for some reason she decides to float about attacking you in what &#8211; as our ed described to me in an email &#8211; “appears to be a giant laughing vulva-plant which flaps open periodically to reveal she still isn&#8217;t wearing a great deal…”.  <strong>Super</strong>.</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure she gets referred to as some less-than-charming things too by hench<strong>men</strong>.</p>
<p>Fast forward to <strong>Arkham City</strong>, which I got in another sale (but it still cost me £20), and now you can play as <a title="Batman Wiki: Catwoman" href="http://batman.wikia.com/wiki/Catwoman_(Batman:_Arkham_City)">Catwoman</a> too!  <em>However,</em> she appears to have fallen foul of <a title="[Gamer Diary] – Dystopian Beauties: How the Apocalypse Killed all the Trolls" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/11/23/gamer-diary-dystopian-beauties-how-the-apocalypse-killed-all-the-trolls/" target="_blank">Rule 1 of Sensible Female Armour</a>: her suit is only ever zipped up to just below her breasts, allowing for ample cleavage.  When you fight thugs as Catwoman, you get called a ‘bitch’ but for some reason, if you’re Batman, you don’t get called a prick, a wanker, a bastard or even a knobend.  <em>Really</em>, people?</p>
<p>The assassins of Rā&#8217;s al Ghūl’s order are all for some reason scantily clad sex icons – as is his <a title="Batman Wiki: Talia al Ghul" href="http://batman.wikia.com/wiki/Talia_al_Ghul_(Batman:_Arkham_City)" target="_blank">daughter</a> – and the <a title="DeviantART: Arkham City Assassin Concept Art" href="http://makiog.deviantart.com/art/Arkham-City-Assasin-Concept-Art-277619351" target="_blank">concept art</a> is mainly essentially the sort of softcore you might find in lads’ mags.  In fact the vast majority of the concept art involving any female character is pretty oversexualised and repugnant.  We get to meet Ivy again, too, but it seems she still hasn’t bothered to find any clothes since the laughing vulva-plant incident.  And Harley is wearing even more revealing kit than last time.</p>
<div id="attachment_11654" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/harley.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11654" data-attachment-id="11654" data-permalink="/2012/01/30/gamer-diary-batman-arkham-asylum-arkham-city-or-the-bat-and-his-bitches/harley/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/harley.jpg?fit=570%2C299&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="570,299" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="harley" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/harley.jpg?fit=300%2C157&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/harley.jpg?fit=570%2C299&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-11654" title="harley" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/harley-300x157.jpg?resize=300%2C157" alt="Harley Quinn, in a low-cut leather bustier with blonde pigtails, gestures at Batman" width="300" height="157" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/harley.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/harley.jpg?w=570&amp;ssl=1 570w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-11654" class="wp-caption-text">Great graphics, but do we really need to see that much breast?</p></div>
<p>Now, even if we leave aside all of this sexist nonsense, <strong>Arkham City</strong> is somewhat disappointing anyway.  I finished the storyline in less than a day; the ending snuck up on me and was rubbish.  I won’t say what happens, but&#8230; just&#8230; what?!  That’s even before I get to the complaint I have with the <em>huge</em> continuity hole left at the end.  I was so disheartened by it that I did a Ragequit of Disappoints and haven’t gone back on it since.  Even though I still have lots of side quests and puzzles to solve, I just haven’t found the heart to go back to it.</p>
<p><strong>Arkham Asylum</strong> was worth the £5 but <strong>City</strong> was definitely not worth the £20 – let alone the standard retail price in the range of up to £39.99!  The first game offered something new and interesting with a gorgeous noir feel much akin to Nolan’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_in_film#Christopher_Nolan_trilogy">reimagining</a> of Gotham on film, if not grittier.  The second game whizzed past all too quickly, with no real indication that one should slow down, do side quests, do the puzzles and so on, lest you face the atrocious storyline ending.</p>
<p>Benefits of the second game, however, do exist; the world is larger, you get more gadgets and there are no area transitions between outdoor locations.  Plus you <em>do</em> get to play as Catwoman, even if she is just eye candy to be abused by burly henchmen. <em>(Are there really no female crims in Gotham?)</em></p>
<p>Both games do fall down woefully at the Treating Female Characters with Respect hurdle.  Would it truly be so hard to think logically about the design of these people?  Does Batman walk around without his Kevlar body armour, flexing his pectorals, with a big “SHOOT HERE” target on his chest?  No.  No, he does not.  So why should Catwoman, or Ivy, or Harley?  Basic boob-sense would say maybe a comfy sports bra would be better than leather basques and flimsy shirts with only one button done up.  At least then the breast tissue wouldn’t detach during all this acrobatic criminality.</p>
<p>Also, Catwoman has anti-gravity boobs.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Vitriol is more properly known by its scientific name: sulphuric acid. In the 1800s there was an apparent epidemic of vitriol throwing in addition to arsenic poisoning – so much so, that it got its own verb: to vitriolize.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6 style="text-align: center;">V</h6>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">VITRIOL</h2>
<blockquote><p>Heaven has no rage like love to hatred turned,<br />
Nor hell a fury like a woman scorned.</p>
<p>William Congreve, <strong>The Mourning Bride </strong>(1697)</p></blockquote>
<h3>This Corrosion.</h3>
<p>Vitriol is more properly known by its scientific name: <em>sulphuric acid</em>. Or additionally, &#8216;Any of various sulphates of metallic elements, especially ferrous sulphate.&#8217; The only reason I get to do it for V is because the late c13th had a rather fanciful approach to science (no offence guys), and dubbed this chemical <em>vitriol</em>, from the Latin <em>vitreus </em>(= &#8216;of glass, glassy&#8217;). Cos, in certain states, <em>sulphuric acid </em>looks &#8216;glassy&#8217;. Geddit?? Ahem. Actually, there&#8217;s nothing whimsical about <em>vitriol </em>in its everyday life: it&#8217;s extremely corrosive (hi, GCSE Chemistry), and has an exothermic reaction with water, basically meaning it dehydrates anything it comes into contact with&#8230; but then liberates extra heat through the very process of reacting with water, causing more burns. Nasty.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 13px;"> </span></p>
<div id="attachment_4285" style="width: 277px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Catherine-de-medici.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4285" data-attachment-id="4285" data-permalink="/2011/03/21/an-alphabet-of-feminism-22-v-is-for-vitriol/catherine-de-medici/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Catherine-de-medici.jpg?fit=445%2C600&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="445,600" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Catherine De Medici" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Catherine-de-medici.jpg?fit=222%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Catherine-de-medici.jpg?fit=445%2C600&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-4285 " src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Catherine-de-medici.jpg?resize=267%2C360" alt="A contemporary portrait of Catherine de Medici, depicting her dressed in black and carrying a fan." width="267" height="360" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Catherine-de-medici.jpg?w=445&amp;ssl=1 445w, https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Catherine-de-medici.jpg?w=222&amp;ssl=1 222w" sizes="(max-width: 267px) 100vw, 267px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-4285" class="wp-caption-text">Catherine de Medici, attributed to Francois Clouet, c.1555</p></div>
<p>Of course, like its sibling term <em>acid, vitriol </em>is also a lovely little example of a word whose literal and figurative meanings have almost equal prominence in modern English. Thus, around 1769, <em>vitriol </em>started meaning &#8216;Acrimonious, caustic or scathing speech, criticism or feeling&#8217; and – naturally – this sense was in figurative relation to sulphuric acid&#8217;s &#8216;corrosive&#8217; qualities. <span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 13px;">These are the same corrosive properties that made sulphuric acid every murderer&#8217;s friend throughout criminal history – every Wikipedia fan given to perverse procrastination </span>knows about John George Haigh, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_George_Haigh">Acid Bath Murderer</a>, who dissolved the bodies of his victims in a bath full of acid (but was eventually dobbed in by a couple of stray gallstones and part of a denture)&#8230; Shudder.</p>
<h3>My pain, your thrill.</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 13px;">Anyway, <em>vitriol</em> has apparently been around since ancient times, but came into prominence during the late c19th, owing to its use as a cleaning product. Of course, since it was suddenly considered fine for trying at home, it was easily purchased at your local chemist by every housewife on her weekly shop.</span></p>
<p>In this context, I&#8217;ve always thought of <em>vitriol </em>as a pendant to <em>arsenic</em>, a household poison used for pest-control, cosmetics and suicide (if you&#8217;re French, bourgeois and in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madame_Bovary">Flaubert novel</a>). Particularly suggestible Victorian women would mix this one with chalk and vinegar to improve their complexion, with occasionally fatal consequences for their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqua_Tofana">hapless spouses</a>. History is correspondingly full of tales of malevolent arsenic-armed females, including the eighteenth-century <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Blandy">Mary Blandy</a>, who put it in her father&#8217;s tea so she could marry her lover.

<p>These cases are part of a long tradition of female poisoners going back to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_de'_Medici">Catherine de Medici</a> and the Emperor Augustus&#8217; wife <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livia">Livia</a>, both politically powerful women who were the subject of (probably apocryphal) rumours of poisonous ingenuity. Livia supposedly killed Augustus by poisoning figs that were still on the tree (the last in a line of such crimes, if you like a bit of <strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yNNviQNna4">I, Claudius</a></strong>. As everyone should.) and that old gossip-monger <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandre_Dumas">Alexandre Dumas</a> describes how Catherine de Medici used to poison casual household objects – ranging from books and gloves to lipsticks – to relieve herself of Inconveniences who just happened to be breathing.</p>
<p>The logic behind this tradition seems clear enough: unaccustomed to the brutalities of war and macho posturing, the female murderer is nonetheless skilled in the arts of household management, food preparation and cosmetics. Her arsenal is correspondingly domestic, and widespread reporting of female poisoners presumably relates to a kind of fear of the unknowably deadly potential of the home (and all it represents), not to mention the oft-observed &#8216;fact&#8217; that the female of the species will tend towards silent attack, backstabbing and general wiliness when settling her battles. The <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/10/11/an-alphabet-of-femininism-2-b-is-for-bitch/">bitch</a>! Thus, like <em>vitriol</em>, <em>poison </em>too has a transferred sense: to be <em>poisonous </em>is to be &#8216;deeply malicious, malevolent&#8217; – &#8216;sly&#8217; – in a way which is almost antonymic to simple &#8216;brutality&#8217;.</p>
<h3>Don&#8217;t look back in anger.</h3>
<p>But in the late 1800s something changed, and there was an apparent epidemic of <em>vitriol throwing</em> in addition to arsenic poisoning <em>– </em>so much so, that it got its own verb: to<em> vitriolize </em>was to &#8216;throw sulphuric acid at a person with intent to injure&#8217;. Thankfully, this verb is now &#8216;rare&#8217; (although on this, see more below), but its usage was overwhelmingly nineteenth-century. Moreover, a cursory look at newspaper records reveals these were overwhelmingly perceived to be <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F60912F83F5B10738DDDAD0994D9415B8484F0D3">female crimes</a> against an <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_h3kuIb49xUU/TNFvMRldp9I/AAAAAAAAAA4/nSGw8K8PB3o/s1600/vitriol+petit+journale.jpg">erstwhile lover </a>or a rival. A &#8216;crime of passion&#8217;, in fact, in a way that poisoning (slow and subtle) is not. <a href="http://www.theatreofthedamned.com/">My pal Stewart</a> has recently started resurrecting the Parisian <strong>Grand Guignol</strong>, a Parisian theatre of horror whose depiction of acid-throwing was only one of many acts of mutilation presented onstage between 1897-1962, and <a href="http://theatredamned.blogspot.com/2010/11/violence-and-vitriol-exploring-le.html">I&#8217;m quoting him quoting Anne-Louise Shapiro</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the 1880s, vitriol began to acquire the symbolic associations traditionally linked to poison; <em>l’empoisonneuse</em> was joined by a new rhetorical (and actual) figure, the <em>vitrioleuse</em>. [&#8230;] Women who were dangerous through their very domesticity – who transformed the ordinary and the womanly into the menacing &#8211; underscored not only female duplicity but male dependency.</p>
<p>Anne-Louise Shapiro, <strong>Breaking the Codes: Female Criminality in fin-de-siecle Paris</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Guignol">Grand Guignol</a> play <strong>La Baisir dans la Nuit </strong>hinges around a disfigured acid victim exercising (literal) eye-for-an-eye revenge on the lover responsible for his wretched state. This sort of thing is perhaps to be expected in a &#8216;theatre of horror&#8217;, but <em>vitriol throwing</em> also appears in the broadly passion-free Sherlock Holmes stories, most fully in the <strong>Adventure of the Illustrious Client </strong>(1924) where the crime in question is perpetrated by a Fallen Woman on her Base Seducer – over ten years after the frequency of cases had prompted <a href="http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1908/may/27/vitriol-throwing">calls to make the purchase of vitriol more difficult</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, this &#8216;Kitty Winter&#8217; is full of <em>vitriol </em>of both kinds: as Watson puts it, &#8216;there was an intensity of hatred in her white, set face and her blazing eyes such as woman seldom and man never can attain&#8217;, and her <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/11/22/an-alphabet-of-femininism-8-h-is-for-hysteria/">hysterical</a> ranting and raving against the &#8216;instrument of her demise&#8217; is – throughout the story – placed in opposition to the calm and aristocratic air of her Don Juan&#8217;s next victim. Throughout the story it is made clear that <em>vitriol throwing </em>is the sort of thing possible only for a woman full of a special kind of fury – and, as Watson makes clear, that fury is something &#8216;man never can attain&#8217;. The lambs.</p>
<p>The interesting thing here, of course, is the transition from silent, wily domestic <em>poisons</em> to public acid attacks that hinge around the old adage that &#8216;Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned&#8217; (a misquote from Congreve <a href="http://knucklesunited.com/2010/02/hell-hath-no-fury-like-a-woman-scorned-18-pics/">that endures to this day</a>). This, of course, is a woman armed with <em>vitriol </em>of one kind or another, and the idea was clearly much-repeated, because by the mid-century we also had the word <em>vitriolic</em>, meaning&#8230; well&#8230; &#8216;like vitriol&#8217;. That said, it is frequently unclear whether this is <em>vitriol </em>in a literal or figurative sense: in 1919 the Sarah Palin of the nineteenth century, Mary Kilbreth (President of the American National Association to Oppose Woman Suffrage), questioned Emmeline Pankhurst&#8217;s patriotism on the grounds that Pankhurst and the Suffragettes had led a &#8216;reign of terror&#8217; that involved &#8216;<a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MnMF_H5V9qwC&amp;pg=PA318&amp;lpg=PA318&amp;dq=vitriol+throwing+suffragette&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TrY7MuJE6R&amp;sig=_wUynt426C-mYWwGp59pEsdUdbE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mCODTeFXhc6EB5blkK4E&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=vitriol&amp;f=false">bombs, kerosene and <em>vitriol</em> throwing</a>&#8216;, but whether she meant words or household cleaner remains tantalisingly unclear.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, for many around the world today <em>vitriol </em>is all too literal. This article has been interested in exploring the criminal female in history but – in the UK and abroad – acid attacks are still common, particularly (but not exclusively) as part of a culture of &#8216;honour violence&#8217; directed against women. While it would be disingenuous to suggest exclusivity on either side, it does seem that these are increasingly male-on-female attacks in contrast to the apparent gender-split in the nineteenth century. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/dec/24/acid-attack-victims-honour-violence">This article</a> has a rather good summary of the current situation, and recommends places you can find out more, including the<a href="http://www.acidviolence.org/"> Acid Survivors Trust</a>.<a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/V-is-for-Vitriol-e1300624545993.jpg"><br />
