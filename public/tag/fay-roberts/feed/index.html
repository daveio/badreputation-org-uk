<em>“Hello, my name is Hannah&#8230; and I am a poet.”</p>
<p>“Hi, Hannah.”</p>
<p>“It started with just scribbling the odd rhyme by myself in my teens. Then I went away to university and learned you can have poetry slams, but even then I didn&#8217;t really take to it. Then, in 2009, I moved back to London. Not many of my friends had moved back yet and I didn&#8217;t know many people and then one night I just fell into the wrong crowd&#8230; you know how it goes.”</em></p>
<p>OK, not quite, but from the way many people respond when the subject comes up&#8230;. you&#8217;d think it was something at least a bit distasteful. And when it’s not great, it’s not great, but when it&#8217;s good: holy shit, you have no idea.</p>
<p>See Exhibit A:<br />
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/tzTuOQRTE0I?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>When it’s done right, performance poetry (or ‘spoken word’ as it’s often coyly referred to) is a thrilling, visceral, hilarious and beautiful experience, going everywhere from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea2SLnLRL3M">music-backed comedy</a> to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpHqrUT5r20">rap</a> to beat and sonnets. Most nights have an open mic section, too, so the opportunity to try your hand and get involved is always there. </p>
<p>This is one of the first pieces I saw performed live, and I was hooked: <iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/pQfxQqIrqiI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe> </p>
<p>Three gigs and a couple of glasses of wine later and I was on stage trying my hand in the <a href="http://www.hammerandtongue.co.uk/">Hammer &#038; Tongue</a> slam. I came second. No going back. Though I’ve been a writer for years, there’s something incomparable about seeing your work hit an audience – getting gasps and laughs right where you hoped they’d be. And – when it doesn’t quite hit the mark – you’ve just had a room full of feedback. OK, back to the drawing board &#8211; cut the third stanza, up the ending, sort the rhythm in the third line and try again next week. </p>
<p>And now – wonder of wonders – I’m part of <strong>Other Voices</strong>, a poetry show that’s going up to the Edinburgh Fringe and is organised by the ‘Welsh whisperer’ <a href="http://www.fayroberts.co.uk/poetry/performance/CV.html">Fay Roberts</a>. The shows are (according to an audience member on Sunday:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;A heady blend of rhythms &#8211; poems that catch you in the throat, stories so compelling that you realise you haven&#8217;t taken a breath in minutes, and if you start to take yourself too seriously, then surely someone will tell life in words so true you wonder if they are reading your diary.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>So, yeah. I’m pretty stoked.  The vibe is big, vampy and bold. Red drapes, candles, and did I meantion the bowls of heart-shaped sweeties? The booked acts are an array of outspoken women weaving words about whatever we damn like. We have a London premier <strong>this Thursday 26 July </strong>at the wonderful Hackney Attic (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/469600776384467/">Facebook event here</a>) featuring Fay Roberts, Sophia Blackwell, Fran Isherwood, Isadora Vibes, and yours truly &#8211; Hannah Eiseman-Renyard.</p>
<p>If you read BadRep, there’s a strong chance <a href="http://www.allographic.co.uk/othervoicesedinburgh/">this is relevant to your interests</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s my own contribution (dressed like a goth glitterball because showbiz): <iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/VhkKGgpLiE8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Other Voices: Alternative Spoken Word Cabaret</strong>, at the Hackney Attic tomorrow, and then the Edinburgh Fringe. Book tickets for tomorrow <a href="http://www.hackneyattic.co.uk">here</a> or see above for Edinburgh.</em></li>
