										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the past year, a lot of my spare time has been spent researching and writing on women in post-punk for Julia Downes&#8217; new history of the girl band, <a href="http://www.foyles.co.uk/Public/Shop/Detail.aspx?itemId=22095722"><strong>Women Make Noise</strong></a>. </p>
<p>A surprisingly difficult part of this was establishing what we talk about when we talk about post-punk. Roughly, the term refers to the wave of musical experimentation which took place in the wake of punk from the late 1970s to the mid-1980s. It was informed conceptually by the art-school background and grounding in political and cultural theory of many of its members, and distinguished by musical, vocal and lyrical experimentation and by a frequently self-conscious and self-critical approach to the idea of being in a band and making music. All of which meant that it sounded, to varying degrees, original, arresting, and odd.</p>
<p>Post-punk’s disorderly, subversive and category-resistant nature has seen it marginalised in accounts of its era, although the past few years have produced a handful of <a href="http://ripitupinfohype.blogspot.co.uk/2007/08/info-on-rip-it-up-and-start-again.html">useful retrospectives</a>, as well as the early-2000s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-punk_revival">revival</a> of post-punk musical techniques which, if you still can’t explain what it is, at least make it easier to explain what it sounds like.</p>
<p>For me, a large part of the significance of post-punk was that it seemed to involve an unprecedented amount of women as artists, fans, and critics. Its musical, political and aesthetic influence can be traced in many subsequent female-friendly movements, including twee, riot grrrl, grunge and electro. Some post-punk women – <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/03/06/rhian-jones-cover-girls-and-typical-girls/" target="_blank">the Slits</a>, <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/09/29/subtle-subversion-how-i-learned-to-love-the-raincoats-a-bit/" target="_blank">the Raincoats</a>, Lydia Lunch – have made a more enduring dent in popular consciousness than others, and some of them are more ‘hmm, interesting’ than ‘fuck yeah, hidden early-80s gem’, but all the artists featured below are worth a spin.</p>
<p>Extending the gains of punk’s emphasis on DIY culture, accessibility and amateurism, post-punk women were able to take their bands in experimental directions, producing lyrics which explored the female experience in startlingly innovative ways, and music which itself took on what Slits bassist Tessa Pollitt described, when I interviewed her for the book, as a ‘new, raw, and female’ form, a self-consciously radical sound dealing with rarely-expressed emotions like embarrassment, awkwardness and anxiety.</p>
<p>In terms of subject matter, post-punk’s ideological concern with the politicisation of the personal, and with identifying and promoting authenticity in the face of popular cultural stereotypes, lent itself to exploration from a feminine and feminist angle. This concern with authenticity was expressed in the songs themselves, which were produced, structured and presented in a way which set them apart from the glossy manufactured products of mainstream artists. It was expressed too in lyrics which demystified and deconstructed conventional femininity, love, sex and romance, and which analysed social and cultural pressures on women or the tensions of personal relationships in implicitly political ways.</p>
<p>There is far more to post-punk, and many more women within it, than I have space for here. <a href="http://musicophilia.wordpress.com/2009/01/27/women-of-post-punk-the-young-ladys-post-punk-handbook-volume-1-1978-1983/"><strong>The Young Lady’s Post-Punk Handbook</strong></a> provides a good starting-point to other women and bands in the movement, but here are ten from me to kick off:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>1. ESG</strong></p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='420' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/iaxTHyY58og?version=3&#038;rel=0&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe>
<p>ESG, from South Bronx, based their pioneering sound on a love of James Brown, Motown and disco. Spotted at a talent contest, they began to play New York’s cutting-edge clubs, where their sound dovetailed neatly, if unexpectedly, with that of the No Wave scene, and went on to share billing with PiL, Gang of Four and A Certain Ratio. </p>
<p>ESG’s blend of hip-hop and girl-group lyrical sensibility was <a href="http://www.whosampled.com/sampled/ESG/">sampled incessantly</a> by acts from Miles Davis to Tricky and Public Enemy to Liars – although the lack of royalties received antagonized the band, who addressed the issue with typical panache in the 1993 single ‘Sample Credits Don’t Pay Our Bills’.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>2. Raincoats</strong></p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='420' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/MIhrQDIQD2c?version=3&#038;rel=0&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe>
<p>The Raincoats attempted an unsweetened exploration of the social and sexual experience for women, mapping a landscape previously foreign to mainstream rock – a female-centred one of self-consciousness and self-doubt. Their debut’s self-effacing musical communalism has seen it described as the first ‘women’s rock&#8217; album.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>3. Slits</strong></p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='420' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/wrLMm5d6lqg?version=3&#038;rel=0&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe>
<p>From the art-student squats of London’s Ladbroke Grove via Germany, Spain and English suburbia, the Slits made slippery and spacious dub-punk hymns to sex and shoplifting. &#8216;Love und Romance&#8217; burlesques the banality of boy-meets-girl, &#8216;Spend, Spend, Spend’ analyses retail therapy as addiction, and &#8216;Typical Girls&#8217; castigates conventional femininity as a profit-driven invention.</p>
<p>For more on the Slits I&#8217;d recommend Zoe Street Howe&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Typical-Girls-The-Story-Slits/dp/1847727808/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1352282108&#038;sr=8-1" target="_blank"><strong>Typical Girls? The story of the Slits</strong></a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>4. Bush Tetras</strong></p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='420' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qmn-P4qbIwo?version=3&#038;rel=0&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe>
<p>There’ve been <a href="http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/40071655?uid=3738032&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21100781977701&quot;">whole essays</a> written on this song as key to life in late-70s crisis-riddled New York, but Pat Place’s stabbing guitar and Cynthia Sley’s vocal darting between grouchy imperious disdain and incipient panic are more than enough to recommend it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>5. Lydia Lunch</strong></p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='420' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ecJ9ZaRCQOk?version=3&#038;rel=0&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe>
<p>The infernal anti-Blondie, or perhaps the sub-par Patti Smith. For Lunch, the extent of her musical ability &#8216;wasn&#8217;t the point. I developed my own style, which suited the primal urgency I needed to evacuate from my system&#8217; (quoted in Simon Reynolds&#8217; <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Rip-Up-Start-Again-1978-1984/dp/057121570X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1352282203&#038;sr=1-1" target="_blank"><strong>Rip it Up and Start Again: Postpunk 1978-1984</strong></a>). </p>
<p>Lunch’s performances were, according to contemporary music writer Roy Trakin (quoted <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/No-Wave-Post-Punk-Underground-1976-1980/dp/0810995433" target="_blank">here</a>) ‘very influential in freeing people from the idea of technique as being somehow prerequisite to talent’.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>6. LiLiPUT</strong></p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='420' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ocBJt6Xz0iI?version=3&#038;rel=0&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe>
<p>Surrealistic in their Swiss-German and English lyrics, rudimentary in their technique, and the subject of a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXk0LIpa2i4" target="_blank">40-seconds-long Yummy Fur song</a> (<em>Why don’t you listen to Liliput / Where punk rock starts and ends?</em>), but great for all that.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>7. The Bloods</strong></p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='420' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xnhqi0PqDG4?version=3&#038;rel=0&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe>
<p>New York&#8217;s finest queer anarcha-feminists. &#8216;Button Up&#8217;, their only single, is absurdly ahead of its time kink-funk.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>8. Mo-dettes</strong></p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='420' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/-V7PomVtlz4?version=3&#038;rel=0&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe>
<p>Sharp-tongued and stylish Anglo-Swiss outfit. Had a complicated relationship with the partisan feminism of some of their contemporaries, but their arch, insouciant music was less ambivalent. ‘White Mice’ giddily champions female sexual agency, ‘Two Can Play’ dramatises relationships as struggles for autonomy and control, and ‘Foolish Girl’ catalogues the misadventures of a girl who renounces feminism for an unhappy marital ending.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>9. Au Pairs</strong></p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='420' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/fyMEs2ltssA?version=3&#038;rel=0&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe>
<p>At the intersection of left, feminist, queer and antiracist politics, Birmingham boys and girls the Au Pairs made radical, slyly danceable music. A good introduction to them from the Kitchen Tapes’ Rupinder Parhar <a href="http://www.newleftproject.org/index.php/site/blog_comments/rebel_music_8_the_au_pairs">can be found here</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>10. Linder Sterling</strong></p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='420' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/rvryKnzZtZE?version=3&#038;rel=0&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe>
<p>Muse to Buzzcocks and Morrissey, a visual and performance artist whose work critiqued cultural expectations of women and the commodification of the female body, an unequivocally militant feminist and occasionally a musician with the band Ludus. Ten post-punk points if your response in 2010 to Lady Gaga’s meat dress was to sniffily point out that <a href="http://032c.com/2006/fuck-morrissey-here%E2%80%99s-linder/">Linder did it better</a> at the Hacienda nearly thirty years ago.</p>
<p>For more on the background, careers, music and politics of these and other girl groups, and a look at the history of women in music from Ma Rainey to Pussy Riot &#8211; please consider <a href="http://www.foyles.co.uk/Public/Shop/Detail.aspx?itemId=22095722">buying the book</a>!</p>

</ul>
<h3>The Plot Sickens</h3>
<p>To focus on misogyny is to obscure <strong>American Psycho</strong>’s scope, to ignore that the book is an uncompromising, unapologetic vortex of misanthropy and nihilism. Its narrator expresses disgust, contempt, anxiety and fear towards women, gay people, art students, Jewish people, the non-WASP, the homeless, the poor – anyone, in fact, who differs even by a small degree (a marginally more impressive business card, a better restaurant table) from the ideal which Bateman forces himself to emulate and sustain. Men in the novel are portrayed as unsympathetically as women, and dispatched as dispassionately – so why is it the torture and death of women that seems to abide with the reader?</p>

<p>Like all satire, the book exaggerates and burlesques that which already exists. The book’s scenes of torture and murder were, apparently, all based on Ellis’ reading of real life cases and criminology textbooks, not whimsically called into being by him. So <strong>American Psycho</strong> on one level is an uncensored, unsanitised exposé of what has already been done to women without any incitement or instruction from its author. Neither does Ellis’ writing give the impression that violence against women is in any way attractive. The impression it does give, to me at least, is that violence against women is horrifying, viscerally disgusting, and the preserve of fucked-up, nightmarish individuals who are increasingly prevalent during a stage of socio-economic development which encourages selfishness and greed over empathy, and whose actions are increasingly ignored or disbelieved within the same environment. His work is a mirror, not a manifesto or an instruction manual. To posit it as something qualitatively worse either than crimes actually committed against women throughout history, or to the presentation of sexualised violence or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_killer#In_media_and_popular_culture">serial killing </a>in almost any other area of the entertainment world, seems dubious.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting too how the deaths of Bateman’s victims are affected by their socio-economic background. Having decided against the murder of his date Patricia – a minor character so boringly materialistic that I’m fully on board with the theory that takes her to be Patrick’s imaginary female persona – Bateman reflects on whether it’s ‘her family’s wealth [that] protects her tonight’. In contrast, the vagrants and call girls he kills are already economic casualties, considered disposable even before they become casualties of violence. No character from society&#8217;s lower strata appears to be missed; it is only Paul Owen, Patrick&#8217;s peer and rival, whose disappearance is considered deserving enough to warrant a police investigation. The crude and blatant contrast between Bateman’s lifestyle and that of his victims – their disparity in wealth, and therefore in power, is explicitly fetishized in more than one encounter – which calls attention to the issue of why the victims of such killers are so often sex workers, or homeless, or transient, both male and female:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Within police culture&#8230; we know that if a prostitute goes missing and is reported as missing, that they won&#8217;t be given the same priority as other people would get&#8230; [sex workers are not] valued enough in our culture for the police to take it seriously.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8211; <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2010/dec/22/world-violence-sex-workers">David Wilson, Howard League for Penal Reform</a></p></blockquote>

<p>One could argue incessantly about whether the book itself is misogynistic, or edifying, or indeed readable, but a<br />
<a href="http://www.socialjusticeleague.net/2011/09/how-to-be-a-fan-of-problematic-things/">more productive debate</a> centres on whether one can like art that one also acknowledges as problematic. When reading Anwyn Crawford’s excellent <a href="http://njmcgee.tumblr.com/post/282550705/anwyn-crawford-makes-an-impressive-attack-on-nick">critique</a> of the treatment of women in the lyrics and prose of that other aging <em>enfant terrible</em>, Nick Cave, I wasn’t convinced by all of her analysis – Cave&#8217;s work at least in its earlier phases seems, like Ellis, preoccupied with morbidly examining a pathologised masculinity rather than valorising it – but the most substantial point I drew from the ensuing debate was that the issue may be less such works themselves and more their involvement in the mainstreaming, acceptance and excusing of problematic attitudes. The gynophobic aspects of these works are made respectable by being cloaked as edgy or transgressive, when they merely dramatise the violence and inequality that already exists. Although I still contend that the violence in Ellis’ writing is not there as intentional titillation, as long as there are those for whom such things are lived experience, rather than escapist fantasy or performance material, then there will be a correspondingly visceral response to their artistic portrayal.</p>
<p>Although readers who read for prurient or puerile pleasure are hardly something for which writers can bargain or legislate, questions can be asked about the <em>cachet</em> Ellis manages to retain in the world of <strong>Guardian</strong> profiles and Soho salons, when other works of equally politicised and equally slapstick splatterpunk – Dennis Cooper, say, or Stewart Home, or even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCUM_Manifesto"><strong>The SCUM Manifesto</strong></a> – languish in the ‘cult fiction’ gutter. Helen Zahavi&#8217;s brilliant <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_Weekend_(novel)"><strong>Dirty Weekend</strong></a>, a novel published the same year as <strong>American Psycho</strong>, explores similar themes but blurs the lines between victim and perpetrator. There are marked stylistic differences, sure – Zahavi uses lyrical prose to distance or distract the reader from the trauma and gore she describes, whereas Ellis more or less rubs the reader’s face in it – and the violence of Zahavi’s protagonist is entirely reactive: she wishes only to be left alone and when she is not, she strikes out and strikes upwards. <strong>Dirty Weekend</strong>, despite receiving polarised reviews on publication, has had nothing like the long-term vilification heaped upon <strong>American Psycho</strong>, but by the same token has received far less enduring acclaim or even attention.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s just Ellis’ pre-existing status as <em>wunderkind</em> author of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Less_Than_Zero_(novel)"><strong>Less Than Zero</strong></a> that elevates his subsequent work. Or it might be the very obviousness of his traditionalist politics &#8211; <strong>American Psycho</strong> has more than a bit in common with something like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_exit_to_brooklyn"><strong>Last Exit to Brooklyn</strong></a>, a cult novel of 1964 which also enlists depictions of depravity and sexual violence in the service of what can look an awful lot like proscriptive neo-puritanism. Is there more mainstream space for works which reproduce existing social structures and power relations, which, even if they challenge their existence, do so through the evidently ambiguous strategies of grotesque exaggeration or <em>reductio ad ridiculum </em>rather than direct disruption? For all its horrified laughter at the state we’re in, <strong>American Psycho</strong> isn’t in the business of imagining alternatives to it.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[American Psycho is a house built with the tools of the master: it is, just like 80s capitalism, crass, lurid, vulgar, heavy-handed and unapologetic.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The last time I wrote that <a href="http://velvetcoalmine.wordpress.com/2011/05/26/on-liking-american-psycho/">yes, I did like <strong>American Psycho</strong></a>, and no, that wasn&#8217;t because I&#8217;d only seen the film, I was pleasantly surprised to hear that other women felt similarly, but I’m aware that we’re still a minority. <strong>American Psycho</strong> proved controversial even before its release in 1991, its unedited manuscript pushed from publisher to publisher, leaked extracts from it incurring public outrage, and its eventual appearance leapt upon by critics with the single-minded speed of a rat up a Habitrail tube. In terms of people judging the book without having read it, not a great deal seems to have changed. I don&#8217;t really expect to alter anyone&#8217;s opinion with this post, and it isn&#8217;t really even a recommendation &#8211; it&#8217;s just an exploration of why I don&#8217;t regard <strong>American Psycho</strong> as the worst book ever written.</p>

<p>I read the book as a deeply moral – disappointingly puritan, if you like – anti-capitalist and even vaguely feminist tract. <strong>American Psycho</strong> is a house built with the tools of the master: it is, just like 1980s capitalism, crass, lurid, vulgar, heavy-handed and unapologetic. It bludgeons home its basic homily, that consumerism fails to make us happy or to lend meaning to our lives, with all the subtle and delicate artistry of a Reagan speech. But beyond this, in 2012 it’s undeniable that the values and trends the book castigated two decades back have only become more deeply entrenched. Does the book’s earnest, and still depressingly relevant, indictment of capitalism and consumerism excuse its scenes of rape, torture and murder? Maybe not, but I think those who criticise the book on these grounds, like those who called for its suppression and boycott twenty years ago, end up alienating a potential if problematic ally.</p>
<h3>Nightmares on Wall Street</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to take seriously much that Ellis says, about either this book in particular or his work in general. A lot of his public pronouncements deal in Dylanesque obfuscation, or deliberate outrage-baiting – his Twitter account alone is a masterclass in trolling – which makes it both absurd and unfortunate that his work is so often perceived as deadly serious and condemned on the same grounds. His explanations of the origins of <strong>American Psycho</strong>, though, have the ring of sincerity, and place the book in opposition to the impact of 1980s society and culture on the individual male:</p>
<blockquote><p>‘the book is, need I even say this, a criticism of a certain kind of masculinity and a certain kind of white male, heterosexual, capitalist, yuppie scumbag behavior.’</p>
<p>– <a href="http://www.punkglobe.com/breteastonellisinterview0411.php">Bret Easton Ellis, 2011 </a></p>
<p>‘Whenever I am asked to talk American Psycho, I have to remember why I was writing it at the time and what it meant to me. A lot of it had to do with my frustration with having to become an adult and what it meant to be an adult male in American society. I didn&#8217;t want to be one, because all it was about was status. Consumerist success was really the embodiment of what it meant to be a cool guy.’<br />
&#8211; <a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/authors/interviews/article/47587-american-psycho-at-20-catching-up-with-bret-easton-ellis.html">Bret Easton Ellis, 2011</a></p>
<p>‘[Bateman] was crazy the same way [I was]. He did not come out of me sitting down and wanting to write a grand sweeping indictment of yuppie culture. It initiated because of my own isolation and alienation at a point in my life. I was living like Patrick Bateman. I was slipping into a consumerist kind of void that was supposed to give me confidence and make me feel good about myself but just made me feel worse and worse and worse about myself.’<br />
&#8211; <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/rage/archive/s3034896.htm">Bret Easton Ellis, 2010</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Fay Weldon, one of very few women to <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/1991/apr/25/fiction.breteastonellis">positively review</a> the novel, did so while emphasising its anti-capitalist aspects. <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Shopping-Space-American-Generation-Fiction/dp/1852422556/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1336917717&amp;sr=1-2">Elizabeth Young</a>, too, identified Patrick Bateman as not a character but a cipher indicating the nihilism and emptiness of yuppie culture and identity.</p>
<p>Bateman is of course capitalism’s dirty little secret &#8211; the madman in the attic. His sociopathy is mirrored in the socio-economic inequality and political insincerity around him. In his world, the atomised and alienated dealings of colleagues, friends and lovers are highlighted through contrast with the visceral intimacy of murder, and Ellis’ stylistic trick of detailing frenzied sex and violence in flat and clinically dispassionate prose does not disguise that as a form of human encounter it carries more weight than Bateman’s ritualised interactions with colleagues or his sexless and loveless interactions with girlfriends. His narration frequently betrays a yearning for consummation, contact and engagement in the midst of the desperate aching loneliness, the longing for meaning (even Bateman’s violence is purposeless and arbitrary) which permeates the book. In a society so unsustainably alienating and unequal that the centre plainly cannot hold, we see how badly things can fall apart.</p>
<h3>Psycho Drama</h3>
<p>Accused of having written ‘a how-to novel on the torture and dismemberment of women’, Ellis <a href="http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,313573,00.html">found himself</a> subject to boycotts, hate mail, death threats and violent revenge fantasies, on the basis that he had clearly written this book as either wish-fulfillment or glamorised incitement. Detractors of the book and author on these grounds display a puzzling inability to distinguish between creator and creation, which as a first principle is utterly bizarre – where is it written that characters must necessarily be extensions of an approving creator?</p>
<p>The novel contains a few dozen pages in amongst four hundred or so on the torture and dismemberment of women – and of men – though their impact is disproportionate. These scenes – often ludicrous, often grotesque to the point of comedy – are presented as a logical extension of the lack of empathy and mindless, numb urge to consume that characterise the world in which they take place. They don’t seem written in order to arouse any more than the determinedly un-erotic, sterile sex scenes do, or the interminable deconstructions of clothes, cosmetics and Huey Lewis’ back catalogue. The book gradually reaches a point where reading about all three feels indistinguishable in its horrific, unrelenting tedium.</p>

I got through these scenes gingerly on my first read, treating it as a kind of endurance test, but tend to skip them on subsequent reads as they aren&#8217;t the reasons I revisit the book. I read <strong>American Psycho</strong> in the same semi-masochistic spirit in which I watch, for instance, Chris Morris’ and Charlie Brooker’s hipster-eviscerating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Barley"><strong>Nathan Barley</strong></a>, a work also bleakly amusing, also received with disbelief and criticism of its gratuitousness, and also concerned with the consequences of elevating surface over meaning, although its slack-jawed, skinny-jeaned targets were more symptom than cause – and arguably Ellis had already been there, done that, too, with 1998’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glamorama"><strong>Glamorama</strong></a>. I read <strong>American Psycho</strong> like I’d read any work which explored capitalism, consumerism and their messy, distasteful effects, from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_to_the_End_of_the_Night"><strong>Voyage au bout de la nuit</strong></a> to <strong>The Hunger Games</strong>. (But not de Sade. Sometimes life’s just too short.)</p>
<p>Finally, if perhaps most obviously, it takes some effort to read Ellis’ presentation of Bateman’s attitude or actions as approving. Unlike, say, Thomas Harris depicting Hannibal Lecter, or the creators of <strong>Dexter</strong>, he gives his anti-hero little in the way of charisma or appeal. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Harron">Mary Harron</a>’s film of the novel, produced a decade after it when the stardust of the 1980s had settled somewhat, arguably does more than the book to establish Ellis’ unreliable narrator as a slick and stylish seducer rather than a pathetic interchangeable fantasist. Despite the <a href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/foreignc/2012/03/american-psycho.html">subversive</a> nature of Harron’s direction, Christian Bale&#8217;s <em>tour-de-force</em> performance renders Bateman far more compelling than his written incarnation, who is overtly racist, misogynistic and homophobic as well as dim, snobbish, superficial, chronically insecure, socially awkward, a hopeless conversationalist, and tediously obsessed with material goods. If it weren’t for the fact that almost every other character displays exactly the same character traits, it’s conceivable that the novel’s Bateman could make his dates expire of boredom without any need to break out the pneumatic nail-gun.</p>
<p>It’s interesting too that the film’s elevation of Bateman is bound up with its objectification of him, particularly via its concentration on his character’s <a href="http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=515985">proto</a>&#8211;<a href="http://www.marksimpson.com/pages/journalism/metrosexual_beckham.html">metrosexual </a>aspects, but that’s a whole other essay.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is in some ways a sequel to my last post <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/02/08/the-maenads-are-in-the-gym-meditations-on-80s-fitness-videos/">on 80s fitness videos</a>. But if you missed that one, fear not, for here is the backstory: gremlins have taken over my body and given me a sudden interest in physical fitness.</p>
<p>In particular, I have been interested to see how the ideologies and assumptions of the real-life, modern-day gym contrast with the 80s fantasy world to which, until now, my side-bends and sit-ups have been largely confined.</p>
<h3>Ain&#8217;t got a motor in the back of her Honda</h3>
<p>I wanted to start with a class. My local facility was offering a number of options for my preferred time of day: Spinning, Yoga, Body Attack and Body Pump. <a href="http://www.spinning.com/">Spinning</a>, of course, has long been a <strong>Cosmo</strong>-favourite, but it sounded a bit too terrifying for my tentative post-Christmas explorations, so I went for Body Pump because it&#8217;s on a Tuesday, and Tuesdays are good for me.</p>
<p>Like Body Attack, Body Pump originates with the New Zealand-based <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Mills_International">Les Mills workout group</a>. I suppose I&#8217;d always known, objectively, that someone must make up these workouts, but I&#8217;d always vaguely assumed it was the class instructor, or the gym, or something. I certainly hadn&#8217;t realised there are whole organisations dedicated to churning them out &#8211; of which Les Mills is one. Body Pump was the first of their workouts to make it out of New Zealand and into Europe, which it did in the early-to-mid-90s. It&#8217;s now pretty much a young professional gym standard, along with the emerging new trend, PowerPlate (which claims to deal with cellulite, although what doesn&#8217;t [and what does?], frankly).</p>
<h3>Never stray too far from the sidewalk</h3>
<p>In addition to a kind of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dualism_(philosophy_of_mind)">Cartesian &#8216;body/soul&#8217; dualism</a> in their choice of workout titles, Les Mills also has about them something of the cultish air that also characterises Jane Fonda&#8217;s seminal 1980s oeuvre. <a href="http://www.lesmills.com/">Seriously</a>. They refer to &#8216;the Tribe&#8217;. They&#8217;ve declared &#8216;war on sedentary lifestyles&#8217;. And more:</p>
<blockquote><p>We pride ourselves on being brave – the ones who turn up their sleeves when it comes to hard work. The ones that scream ‘hell yeah’ when the instructor barks ‘ten more’. Those who view sweat on their brows like a crown of achievement. The ones who don’t just step up, they turn it up, because they want results.</p>

<p>Scary stuff. The almost-militarism of the Les Mills style plays out into the actual Body Pump workout, which is a weight training class accompanied by &#8216;chart-topping hits&#8217; (well&#8230; &#8216;Because of You&#8217;). Its use of zeitgeisty-kinda music to drive you along aligns it with aerobics more generally, but with the 80s fitness craze in particular, which was similarly interwoven with pop culture, including the emergent disco culture (the seminal <strong>Saturday Night Fever</strong>, with its all-dancing star <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yu8z1DIMe9Q">John Travolta</a>, came out in 1977).</p>
<p>But Body Pump is no leotard-wearing 80s-style &#8216;jazzercise&#8217; with instructors whose hair flows wild and impractically free (my school gym teacher used to make us use elastic bands as a punishment for forgetting proper hair ties) &#8211; and, unlike the films Jane Fonda made for housewives everywhere, Body Pump&#8217;s not, primarily, about women. Indeed, it was originally designed to ‘bring men into the aerobics room’, after the female-focused group exercise trends that preceded it. Whether former female dominance in said room was because women are known to prefer exercising in nice social groups (cos, you know, that&#8217;s how we go to the toilet and choose our clothes, isn&#8217;t it?), or because instructors were targeting women as particularly vulnerable to body fascism, is too big a question to address in whole here.</p>
<h3>Godlike Odysseus</h3>
<p>But certainly, the class I attend has a lot of Homeric-level male muscle in it (with added grunts). And indeed, the ‘tracks’ we listen to (officially chosen by the Les Mills group themselves, who rule over ALL THINGS, and presumably have some kind of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Trent">Council of Trent</a>-style semi-regular meeting to discuss such questions) &#8211; are generally of the &#8216;man-rock&#8217; ilk (well, Kelly Clarkson aside). So sometimes we do staggered bicep curls in time to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btPJPFnesV4&amp;t=0m9s">that bit</a> in <strong>Eye of the Tiger</strong>. There&#8217;s even this bit where you lie on your back on the ‘bench’ (see, I’m down with the lingo) and do some ‘chest-reps’ with ‘barbells’ while listening to <strong>Smells Like Teen Spirit</strong>. [This is a bit I’m quite fond of because I like to pretend I’m in prison or something].</p>

As is the instructor herself, though she&#8217;s more like an army sergeant than a Fonda-esque Dionysian leader.</p>
<p>What I think is interesting here is that, while dear Jane made me feel like I was sharing in an essential female, slightly body-fascist sort of camaraderie (&#8216;this is for the wibble-wobbles on the inner thighs&#8230; gonna burn them right off!&#8217;) &#8211; with a sense of shared understanding much akin to what you might experience in the disco toilets at 2am with mascara running down your face, only with more brutalist physical pain &#8211; Body Pump is more like that bit in <strong>Mulan</strong> where that guy who never wears a shirt trains the Chinese army (including the cross-dressing Mulan) in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSS5dEeMX64">three minutes flat</a>.</p>
<p>Indeed, whereas the 80s fitness dream was one of self-improvement and the drive for the Body Beautiful, Body Pump and the Les Mills ideology is actually more like a War on Fat, with concomitantly refigured notions of gender &#8211; men and women exercise side by side, with parallel physical goals.</p>
<p>The Eighties&#8217; &#8216;woman&#8217;s world&#8217; of VCR, suburban living room and dance-fitness (sexualised to an often ludicrous degree for the benefit of men) has changed to a kind of militant A-team dream. This probably has a lot to do with rising obesity levels in the population at large, making pursuit of exercise rather more of a general health priority than it once was, but since the original 80s fitness craze rose at much the same time as the rise of the disco one, I wonder if our exercise trends are still tangentially following our terpsichorean ones.</p>
<p>Indeed, one of the things I find particularly interesting is how this class &#8211; and actually the gym itself come to that &#8211; constructs itself around the idea of maenadic levels of adrenaline, but in a kind of nightclub context. I have to NB here that I go to a rather Executive gym chain, which to be honest is probably actually constructed in the 80s power-professional mould &#8211; there&#8217;s coloured strip-lighting and everyone&#8217;s wearing matchy-matchy black lycra &#8230;and thongs. (I mean, seriously, think about the physics of that. There will be squats.). In Spinning it goes literal, as the room is darkened and there&#8217;s pounding rave music (at 7am on a Monday morning).</p>
<p>So where does this leave us? Much of this may seem largely irrelevant, since the numbers of women who attend the gym (indeed, the numbers who can even afford it) are relatively small compared to the population at large. And yet! What happens in those harrowing halls may reflect some curious external trends.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A spectre is haunting London. My daily commute, never a joyful affair, has recently been granted a further dimension of irritation by adverts on buses bearing the image of Meryl Streep dolled up as Mrs Thatcher.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A spectre is haunting London. My daily commute, never a joyful affair, has recently been lent a further dimension of irritation by adverts on buses, hoving into view with tedious regularity, bearing the image of <strong>Meryl Streep</strong> dolled up as Mrs Thatcher in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1007029/"><strong>The Iron Lady</strong></a>. Thirty years on from Thatcher&#8217;s rise to power, and after a minor rash of small-screen depictions – Andrea Riseborough in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1067578/"><strong>The Long Walk to Finchley</strong></a>, Lindsay Duncan in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1230150/"><strong>Margaret</strong></a> &#8211; Streep will now portray her on the big screen, the prospect of which I could have happily lived without.</p>
<p>Having as I do <a href="http://velvetcoalmine.wordpress.com/2011/09/19/the-pits-and-the-pendulum/">firsthand experience</a> of the impact of Thatcher’s thirteen years, her government’s break with prevailing consensus and bloody-minded devotion to neoliberal orthodoxies, an objective and rational evaluation of the woman is probably beyond me. That said, her presumably impending death &#8211; although I do have a longstanding appointment at a pub in King&#8217;s Cross to dutifully raise a glass &#8211; is something to which I&#8217;ll be largely indifferent. It won&#8217;t matter. Thatcher as a person has far less bearing on the current world than what she represents. The damage has been done, the battle lost, and much as I might appreciate a Truth and Reconciliation Commission into the 1980s, Thatcher and her co-conspirators are by now <a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/steven-baxter/2011/12/decisions-away-information">too old and whiskey-soaked</a> to be held to any meaningful account.</p>
<p>Efforts to humanise Thatcher, even when they enlist Meryl Streep, seem discomfiting and deeply bizarre. What she means has transcended what she was, is and will be. The purpose of this post, therefore, apart from being an exercise in detachment for me, is to look briefly at some aspects of Thatcher’s image in political and pop culture, and to consider the effect of her gender on her role as a woman in power. Quick, before the next bus goes past.</p>
<h3>The Icon Lady</h3>
<blockquote><p>Meanings of all kinds flow through the figures of women, and they often do not include who she herself is.</p>
<p>&#8211; Marina Warner, <strong>Monuments and Maidens</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Thatcher’s visual staying power in political and pop culture is as great as her impact on <a href="http://johnrobb77.wordpress.com/2009/06/16/how-margaret-thatcher-changed-pop-culture-for-ever/">oppositional music</a>. The face of Thatcher most often called to mind is that of what Angela Carter termed her ‘balefully iconic’ post-1983 premiership: encased in true-blue power suits, wielding a handbag, her hair lacquered into immobile submission, her earlier style solidified into a heavily stylized femininity bordering on drag. Paul Flynn, in a <a href="http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/paul_flynn/2006/05/by_paul_flynn.html">fairly tortured discussion</a> of Thatcher’s status as a gay icon, put it down to her ‘ability to carry a strong, identifiable, signature look&#8230; an intrinsic and steely power to self-transform’, and a ‘camp, easily cartooned presence’. The startling evocative power of this look, its ability to summon up its host of contemporary social, cultural and political associations, is why I jump when Streep&#8217;s replication of it intrudes into my vision. It’s like being repeatedly sideswiped by the 1980s, which is something the last UK election had already made me thoroughly sick of.</p>

The artist Alison Jackson <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/feb/11/margaret-thatcher-meryl-streep-photograph">observes</a> that all three &#8216;had what it takes to become a modern icon: big hair, high foreheads and a face that would allow you to project your own fears and desires on to it.&#8217; Conversely, subsequent political leaders &#8211; including both <a href="http://cvcl.mit.edu/hybrid_gallery/tatcher_blair.html">Blair</a> and <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_OVzuV6XUReA/TJ0EjTQ29WI/AAAAAAAAARU/SOy8bXxatls/s1600/Cameron-Thatcher.png">Cameron</a> &#8211; have had their own faces conflated with Thatcher’s, usually as part of left-wing critiques meant to signify the closeness of their policies to hers. Thatcher’s image is here used as an instantly recognisable political signifier, communicating a set of ideological ideas in a single package, as well as a self-contained political warning sign.</p>
<p>Although the kind of passive objectification associated with Monroe might seem at odds with the idea of Thatcher as a great historical actor with narrative agency in her own right, the images of both women are used in a cultural tradition in which the female figure in particular becomes a canvas for the expression of abstract ideas (think justice, liberty, victory). The abstract embodiment of multiple meanings, and the strategic performance of traditional ideas of femininity, constitute sources of power which Thatcher and her political and media allies exploited to the hilt in their harnessing of support for the policies she promoted.</p>
<h3>Iron Maidens</h3>
<p>Thatcher’s image, rather than appealing solely to a particular aspect of femininity, was a tense mixture of conflicting and mutually reinforcing signifiers. Angela Carter <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/46831407/Angela-Carter-Shaking-a-Leg">identified</a> it as a composite of feminine archetypes, including <strong>Dynasty</strong>’s Alexis Carrington, Elizabeth I as Gloriana, Countess Dracula, and one of PG Wodehouse’s aunts – tropes sharing a certain type of burlesqued and grotesque dragon-femininity. The 1981 Falklands conflict allowed the discourse around Thatcher to reference the precedents of both Queen Victoria and Churchill, and she was photographed on a tank in an <a href="http://iconicphotos.wordpress.com/2009/04/23/thatcher-in-a-tank/">image</a> that the <strong>Daily Telegraph</strong> described as ‘a cross between Isadora Duncan and Lawrence of Arabia’.</p>
<p>Justine Picardie, in a <a href="http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/article/TMG8940986/The-Making-of-The-Iron-Ladys-Wardrobe.html">grimly fascinating read</a>, roots Thatcher’s style in the rigid grooming of well-turned-out 1950s femininity in general and her sartorially plain Methodist upbringing in particular:</p>
<blockquote><p>Interviewed by Dr Miriam Stoppard for Yorkshire Television in 1985, she gave a glimpse of a childhood desire for the luxury of colour, and shop-bought extravagance, whether a new dress or sofa cover: &#8216;that was a great expenditure and a great event. So you went out to choose them, and you chose something that looked really rather lovely, something light with flowers on it. My mother: &#8220;That&#8217;s not serviceable.&#8221; And how I longed for the time when I could buy things that were not serviceable.&#8217;</p></blockquote>
<p>Even at the height of her political power, she chose to retain the ‘pretty’ and ‘softening’ effects of her trademark <a href="http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/galleries/TMG8946898/Margaret-Thatchers-style-over-the-years.html">horrible bows</a>. Alongside this tendency towards aspirational frivolity, she cultivated connotations of the provincial housewife – a ‘Housewife Superstar’ – wearing an apron while on the campaign trail and being shown washing dishes while contesting the party leadership. </p>
<p>Her ‘Iron Lady’ speech distinctly echoed the ‘body of a weak and feeble woman&#8230; heart and stomach of a king’ construction <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_to_the_Troops_at_Tilbury">associated with Elizabeth I</a> in its drawing on the tension between conflicting signifiers:</p>
<blockquote><p>I stand before you tonight in my Red Star chiffon evening gown, my face softly made up and my fair hair gently waved, the Iron Lady of the Western World. A cold war warrior, an Amazon philistine, even a Peking plotter. Well, am I any of those things? Yes&#8230; Yes, I am an iron lady, after all it wasn&#8217;t a bad thing to be an iron duke.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Not a Man to Match Her?</h3>
<p>Thatcher&#8217;s courting of various feminine roles did not prevent the assigning of masculine attributes to her – notably in oppositional parodies and satire. Her iconic <strong>Spitting Image</strong> puppet was shown wearing a suit and tie and smoking a cigar, addressed as &#8216;Sir&#8217;, and given a more or less explicit emasculating effect upon male colleagues and political opponents:</p>
<p><iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/OyU8qmzGsEg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Outside satire, the 1984 Miners&#8217; Strike has been conceptualised both as a <a href="http://deathatthemall.wordpress.com/2011/12/16/men-at-war-mark-simpson-examines-masculinity-and-the-miners-strike/">mass emasculation</a> of ordinary male miners <em>and</em> an overt bout of cock-duelling between Thatcher and miners&#8217; leader Arthur Scargill, each of whom were criticised for an absolutist and stubbornly Napoleonic approach to the conflict rather than a more ‘feminine’ openness to negotiation and compromise.</p>
<p>As Dawn Fowler <a href="http://eprints.uwe.ac.uk/7817/">notes</a> in her consideration of dramatic treatments of the Falklands War, a problem with such portrayals of Thatcher is that she &#8216;can be represented as simply denying her true feminine self in favour of a crazed fascist agenda.&#8217; <strong>The Comic Strip</strong>’s <a href="http://gaffa.org/dreaming/glc.html">satirical take</a> on Thatcher’s battles with Ken Livingstone and the Greater London Council presented her as the victim of alien or demonic possession, the ending of which left her soft and passive – restored to her presumably appropriate, natural form. Both applauding Thatcher for her ability to overcome &#8216;traditional&#8217; feminine weakness and irrationality and behave symbolically as a man, and castigating her for her failure or suppression of a &#8216;true&#8217; soft and accommodating female nature, are equally dubious in the qualities they seek to assign to &#8216;real&#8217; women.</p>
<blockquote><p>Thatcher was repeatedly likened to a female impersonator, a man in blue dresses. The reason for this is simple, and apparently shatterproof: we have so firmly linked power and masculinity that we think a powerful woman is a category error. Instead of changing our ideas about power, we change the sex of a powerful woman. </p>

<h3>No Job for a Lady?</h3>
<p>While Thatcher’s election to Prime Minister was of course a landmark for women in politics, her much-vaunted &#8216;grocer&#8217;s daughter&#8217; outsider status was mediated through an Oxford education and marriage into wealth. The number of prominent women serving as MPs and Cabinet ministers prior to or alongside Thatcher &#8211; Nancy Astor, Margaret Bondfield, Betty Harvie Anderson, Jenny Lee, Barbara Castle to name a few – make her ascension exceptional but not unique. Nor should Thatcher’s progress in the male-dominated world of British politics obscure how little she actually did for women once in office: the lack of women appointed to ministerial positions; her disparaging of ‘strident Women’s Libbers’; her invariably male ideological protégés. Historian Helen Castor, <a href="http://thebrowser.com/interviews/helen-castor-on-queens-and-power?page=3">discussing</a> the ‘extraordinary’ parallels between the iconography of Thatcher and that of Elizabeth I, points out that both women emphasised themselves as the exception to a rule:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;what those two women both did was not say, Women can rule, women can hold power. They both said, Yes, OK, most women are pretty feeble, but I am a special woman.</p></blockquote>
<p>At a point where Thatcher’s chosen ideology is resulting in <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/the-womens-blog-with-jane-martinson/2011/oct/05/womens-dwindling-support-for-cameron">falling standards of living</a> for women &#8211; and men &#8211; across Britain; where the dim and insubstantial <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3252FSW7OC4">Louise Mensch</a> can manage to position herself as a rising star, and where the Home Secretary’s political decisions make fewer headlines than her choice of shoe, I’m relieved to see that attempts to rehabilitate Thatcher as any kind of feminist icon are largely <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-derbyshire-16438897">being </a><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/the-womens-blog-with-jane-martinson/2012/jan/05/margaret-thatcher-feminist-icon?INTCMP=SRCH">resisted</a>. It remains to be seen whether <strong>The Iron Lady</strong>, and its fallout in the form of frankly offensive Thatcher-inspired <a href="http://www.graziadaily.co.uk/fashion/archive/2011/08/11/holy-handbags-batgirl-its-georgia-may-thatcher.htm">fashion shoots</a>, means that her image is now undergoing a further transcendence into the realms of irony and kitsch (as has happened with both Marilyn and Che), or whether this is part of a conscious revival of the political associations her image originally carried and to which we are being returned – conditions profoundly unfriendly to female independence and agency despite the women occasionally employed as their shock troops.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This post is part of a series on the theme of women and protest. The full series is collected <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/tag/revolting-women/">under the tag &#8220;Revolting Women&#8221;</a>. Welcome back to <a href="http://hannahdoublebarrel.wordpress.com/">Hannah Eiseman-Renyard</a>&#8230; </em></p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenham_Common_Women's_Peace_Camp"><strong>Greenham Common</strong></a> was, by all accounts, something epic: a peaceful campaign of sustained, cooperative occupation by women against the bomb – and it <em>worked</em>. From 1981 to 2000 the camp, based around RAF Greenham Common military base in Berkshire, protested the presence of the (American) nuclear weapons held there – and eventually the weapons were removed.</p>

How awesomecool is my momma? </p>
<p>Greenham Common had been an RAF base since 1941, and an American airbase since 1968. When the US moved 96 cruise missiles there in 1980, the protest began – forming properly in 1981. For years women, and their children too, lived in a makeshift camp in all weathers. Much like the <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/09/07/revolting-women-the-fight-for-the-missing-and-the-mothers-of-the-plaza-de-mayo/">Mothers of the Disappeared</a> protest in South America, Greenham Common used the concept of maternal authority to lend weight to their campaign. The women of Greenham Common were not protesting just for themselves, but for everyone – for their children’s future, and for everyone else’s. They hammered this home with slogans like ‘when I grow up I want to be alive’ – and children’s clothes and children’s art were often part of the decorations tied along the fences.</p>
<p>Some children lived in the camp, too. I’m afraid this is where my statistics gets a bit fuzzy because over 19 years, and through different seasons, it probably changed more than a bit.</p>
<p>My mother reports the place was often a carnival: </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;there were the usual collections of street performers and puppet shows to cheer us on&#8230; people on decorated bikes, that kind of thing &#8230; there was a lot of weaving things in the perimeter fence – rainbows, kid art, &#8230; the whole perimeter fence was very gorgeous. There were a lot of spiderwebs in the art. Spiderwebs were a big theme &#8211; I suppose the theme of weaving something, surrounding something.</p></blockquote>
<p>Punks, too. Or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachne">Arachnes</a>. Either way, I approve. </p>
<p>The women who lived there endured arrests, freezing and muddy conditions and the most rudimentary of provisions. Make no mistake – these were badass women. Muddy women, tired women, cold women, but strong, capable, mind-blowingly determined women, and women who were not afraid to use bolt cutters.</p>

The protest was closely allied with CND, and it garnered respect and support from people of all walks of life. This <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/video/2007/dec/12/greenham"><strong>Guardian</strong> video</a> shows the mix and gives slightly more of an idea of what the protests were like than my second-generation verbal squeezing can do.  </p>
<p>Over the ten main years of the protest many people came and went, but the backbone of it all were the base camps. There were nine of these, each based around a different set of gates to the base. Each base gained its own flavour and focus, with the Violet Gate formed of religious groups, the Blue Gate being much more new age, and the Green Gate being entirely women-only as a rule. </p>
<p>Personally I’m dubious about sticking a gender divide in an otherwise very uniting protest – but there were many places where men were welcome, too, and this simply was, from the start, a women’s movement. It was founded and organised by women’s groups (which in the 80s especially were fucking rad) – and women’s groups and unions around the country organised coaches to and from the big demos. </p>
<p>The campaign gained huge amounts of media attention in 1983 when around 70,000 protestors <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/player/nol/newsid_6540000/newsid_6548500/6548577.stm?bw=bb&#038;mp=rm&#038;news=1&#038;ms3=4&#038;ms_javascript=true&#038;bbcws=2">formed a human chain around the base</a>, stopping movement in and out of it. (My mom was there!) With around 100 women being arrested for breaking in. (My mom didn’t do that bit.) The scale and success of the Greenham Common protest was widely credited with prompting similar actions elsewhere in Britain and Europe. </p>
<p>The base camp protestors were evicted on numerous occasions, but always returned before nightfall to set up camp again. </p>
<p>So – how did it all come to a close? In 1991 the weapons were removed – but many protestors stayed a further nine badass years until the final perimeter fences were removed and the Common was returned back to public land. Partly this was to make sure the land was returned, but partly, it seems, because a real community had formed and people were reluctant to leave it. </p>
<p>Above and beyond the call of duty – with rainbows and mud and sisterhood. I think I’m in love. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I make no apologies. I love <strong>She-Ra</strong>. Even just saying it makes me feel all empowered (come on, give me some &#8220;She Raaaargh!&#8221;). It&#8217;s like <a href="http://onewarart.org/riot_grrrl_manifesto.htm">Riot Grrrl</a> for pre-teens.</p>
<p>One of the main joys I had from the show was that it featured an awesome female hero in a world of <em>other awesome women</em>. All too often, as a girl, my female heroes were lonely, sore thumbs sticking out of a world populated only by men. Also known as <a href="http://www.maxbarry.com/2011/07/08/news.html">The Smurf Problem</a>. My other examples of female heroes were all Smurfs: Princess from the deeply confusing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Planets"><strong>Battle of the Planets</strong></a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teela">Teela</a> from the <strong>He-Man</strong> series, <a href="http://thundercats.wikia.com/wiki/Cheetara">Cheetara</a> from <strong>Thundercats</strong> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcee">The Pink Girlie One</a> in <strong>Transformers</strong>. Female fighters were the exception. They were <em>The Girl</em>. The pat-on-the-head for female viewers: &#8220;there, look, she&#8217;s joining in too!&#8221; Not so on Etheria.</p>

<p>Female-heavy shows were a rarity at the time &#8211; and are still (sadly) a rarity. But the ones that exist are inspirational.</p>
<p>Like an animated precursor of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xena"><strong>Xena</strong></a> (noted fact: warrior + princess + sword = kickass) She-Ra lives in a world of female fighters, bitches-getting-shit-done, lady-doers and action women.</p>
<p>Seriously &#8211; take a look at all of them (more to the point, take note of the fact that the only bare midriff on display is from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_She-Ra:_Princess_of_Power_characters#Bow">Bow</a>, one of the few male characters who aren&#8217;t boyfriends, brothers or fathers). Nice bit of gender-reversal there, Mattel.</p>
<p>Oh and did I mention they&#8217;re all freedom fighters? Female freedom fighters battling against the <del>Patriarchy</del> Evil Horde using epic and non-gender stereotypical super powers such as ass-kicking, laser beams, ice and um&#8230; <a href="http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_She-Ra:_Princess_of_Power_characters#Sweet_Bee">being an intergalactic Space Bee</a>. The best bit is that none of them appear to be suffering from <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/01/19/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-the-frank-miller-effect-strikes-again/">Sex Assassin Syndrome</a> (SAS). Except for maybe Bow. Who also sings, bless him.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Women can be just as cool, if not better than men</strong> &#8211; Unlike many &#8216;girlification variants&#8217; She-Ra is <em>so much better</em> than her brother He-Man (although now I have a mature and rich appreciation for the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=390406801837">gay icon himself</a>, including the epic levels of homoerotic implication that I completely failed to see as a small girl). Even in her &#8216;normal&#8217; form as Princess Adora, she is an effective war leader as opposed to Prince Adam, who is  basically Clark Kenting it. Also, her sword can do more stuff.</li>
<li><strong>Princesses do NOT sit in towers doing nothing </strong>&#8211; this is a very important lesson to learn as a young woman. There are umpteen tales of royal ladies hanging around turrets waiting to be rescued. Not so with She-Ra, who is basically too busy defeating evil, saving the planet (in both senses of the term, there&#8217;s a bit of eco-warrior going on here too)  AND having romances with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Hawk_%28She-Ra%29#Sea_Hawk">sexy sea pirates</a> to even consider such vain idleness.</li>
<li><strong>There are other important female professions aside from Being Famous &#8211; </strong>whilst <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxie%27s_World">Maxie</a> might have had &#8220;her own TV show&#8221; and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jem_%28TV_series%29">Jem</a> was &#8220;truly, truly, truly outrageous&#8221; ultimately their main goal in life was to be celebrities. Great. Not so She-Ra &#8211; in fact, keeping out of public view is generally a good idea for rebel leaders. Obviously, she had her followers and people who thought she was cool but she didn&#8217;t court the publicity&#8230; (for some reason I&#8217;m now thinking of her as Che Guevara, only in gold lame. Sorry for that image. But I&#8217;ve got it and now you have too).</li>
<li><strong>You do not have to save the world by yourself</strong> &#8211; harking back to my original point, but that&#8217;s because it&#8217;s a really important one for me to have learned. She-Ra fights her rebellion not just with her magical sword and cool flying horse, but because she creates the United Nations Of Kick Ass Women (and Men Who Wear Crop Tops). Most of the other female characters are leaders in their own right, of different realms and even planets.  Take that, Barbie.</li>
