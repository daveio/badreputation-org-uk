										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No sooner had I finished writing the 1,200 word post featuring the ups and downs of the gamingverse in recent weeks than <a title="Crystal Dynamics" href="http://crystald.com" target="_blank">Crystal Dynamics</a> &#8211; the studio behind the upcoming <a title="Tomb Raider" href="http://www.tombraider.com" target="_blank"><strong>Tomb Raider</strong></a> prequel game &#8211; put their foot in it.</p>
<p>Their executive producer was <a title="Digital Spy: Tomb Raider rape attempt makes players want to protect her" href="http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/gaming/news/a387062/tomb-raider-rape-attempt-encourages-players-to-protect-lara-croft.html" target="_blank">discussing the challenges</a> this young Lara has to face, which includes violent beatings and an attempted rape, and how this would make players want &#8220;to protect her&#8221;.</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/tombraider.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="11355" data-permalink="/2012/07/06/gamer-diary-rollercoaster-june-an-addendum/tombraider/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/tombraider.jpg?fit=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="300,225" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="tombraider" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/tombraider.jpg?fit=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/tombraider.jpg?fit=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-11355" title="tombraider" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/tombraider.jpg?resize=300%2C225" alt="Image of Lara Croft from the new Tomb Raider, covered in mud and scratches, shared under Fair Use guidelines" width="300" height="225" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>The internet exploded with rage, and I got sucked up in it a bit too &#8211; it came after I&#8217;d spent hours reading and listening to accounts of female gamers being threatened with rape just because they dared to play socially.</p>
<p>A day later, Crystal Dynamics <a title="Digital Spy: Tomb Raider Attempted Rape Comment Retracted" href="http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/gaming/news/a387186/tomb-raider-attempted-rape-comments-retracted-by-crystal-dynamics.html" target="_blank">retracted the &#8220;attempted rape&#8221; comment</a> and said it had been misunderstood.  Largely, I am inclined to agree, but not with the use of &#8216;attempted rape&#8217;; that bit wasn&#8217;t misunderstood.  Having seen the footage, that&#8217;s exactly what it is, although it is nowhere near as gruesome as much of the internet&#8217;s collective imagination has fathomed it to be.</p>
<p>The scene in question is part of their E3 trailer <a title="YouTube: Tomb Raider &quot;Crossroads&quot; UK trailer" href="http://youtu.be/2pLzSSv1Qfg" target="_blank">&#8220;Crossroads&#8221;</a> (you need to be signed in to YouTube to view it as it has a content warning on it).  Naturally, I will say that it will be <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>triggering</strong> </span>for some &#8211; <strong>as could the paragraph after next (&amp; other parts of the rest of this post) when I briefly describe what happens</strong> &#8211; the specific scene occurs at 2:15 on the vid.</p>
<p>This <strong>Tomb Raider</strong> is going to be set before the others, and is aiming to develop Lara&#8217;s character into the strong, kickass woman she is in those core, original games.  She is stranded on an island with her crew but there&#8217;s also an all-male gang who have been stranded on said island for much longer and have turned extremely savage.  They kill Lara&#8217;s friends as she watches/hears without being able to help them.  She tries to sneak away, but is found.</p>
<p>The guy who finds her runs his hand down her body; she knees him in the groin and tries to run; he grabs her and tries kissing her neck; she bites his ear and possibly rips some of it off; runs, gets her hands free, gets his gun; they wrestle over the gun&#8230; she shoots him in the face.</p>
<p>Doubtless the full scene in the game will be much longer than what we&#8217;ve seen here, but it is, at least, nothing so crass as hammering the X button on the controller to push him out from between her legs.  All clothes remain on, which doesn&#8217;t make it any less atrocious of course &#8211; but it could be much more graphic for the player.</p>
<p>I think where Crystal Dynamics have been misunderstood is with their intention, and perhaps they&#8217;ve misunderstood their audience when talking about this assault.</p>
<blockquote><p>Discussing why it&#8217;s difficult to develop a female lead, Rosenberg said: &#8220;When people play Lara, they don&#8217;t really project themselves into the character&#8230; They&#8217;re more like. &#8216;I want to protect her&#8217;. There&#8217;s this sort of dynamic of, &#8216;I&#8217;m going to this adventure with her and trying to protect her&#8217;.  She&#8217;s definitely the hero but &#8211; you&#8217;re kind of like her helper. When you see her have to face these challenges, you start to root for her in a way that you might not root for a male character.&#8221;</p>
<p>-from DigitalSpy</p></blockquote>
<p>What I find most concerning/irksome/interesting is this idea that the player wants to protect Lara as opposed to <em>be</em> her. Having watched that trailer, <em>I</em> don&#8217;t want to be her helper and protect her, I want to jump into her skin and kick the daylights out of that guy.  Perhaps that&#8217;s just me.  What I think was ill-advised of Mr Rosenburg (the exec producer) was his move to discuss this damsel-in-distress notion at the same time as discussing the attempted rape.  It kinda oozes the idea that <strong>Lara is just an object for men</strong>:<em> to abuse or to protect.</em></p>
<p>I suspect above all that Crystal Dynamics probably need to educate themselves on better phraseology and improve the content of their press interactions.  They don&#8217;t seem to mean that the assault and the assault alone turn her into the Lara we&#8217;re all familiar with: it&#8217;s the <em>whole</em> ordeal on this island.  I&#8217;m sure shooting a guy in the face not 5 inches from your own is going to be life changing, and on the flipside, for once a studio is at least trying to show the psychological effect of killing (as opposed to all the other games where you&#8217;re expected to believe the protag is completely unfazed by murder, despite being an office worker or somesuch beforehand).</p>
<p><em>But what about the inclusion of the attempted rape in the first place?</em></p>
<p>Good point.  After the initial furore, I wondered whether it could be a useful educational tool: to show the audience that rape is horrific, abhorrent and should never be permitted.  Depressingly, this is a message that doesn&#8217;t seem to have sunk in with some people in society.</p>
<p>Then I saw an interesting theory in a comment thread, in which one chap theorised that we could see this attempted rape symbolically.  Perhaps this potential rapist represents all the slavering, masturbatory porn-ifying by<em> (mostly)</em> male gamers of Lara in previous games; her escape could represent the escape from this pin-up mentality the franchise has been plagued with.  I thought that was an intriguing hypothesis at the very least.</p>
<p>I think their move to include this assault is bold and their intention &#8211; presumably to explore the psychological transformation of such a famous female lead &#8211; is sorely needed, because we don&#8217;t have many fully developed standalone female characters (i.e. that aren&#8217;t just an option opposite a male version).  Above all, however, they probably need to be able to express themselves in a much clearer fashion and, preferably, drop this <em>&#8216;the player just wants to protect her&#8217;</em> nonsense.</p>
<p>If, when it is released, we discover this attempted rape has just been used to crush her identity as a strong, independent female character, to put her back in her place as a subjugated product of patriarchal desires, then I will stand corrected.  For now, I think we should step back and see where this goes.</p>
<p>Overall, however, I fear Lara will never be free of the patriarchy that created her &#8211; in both her story and her creation as a game character. At least they seem to have designed her wearing a bra this time around.</p>
