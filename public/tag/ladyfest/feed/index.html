										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s an item to add to the list of <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/12/02/five-things-i-found-at-ladyfest-ten/">Awesome Things BadRep Found at <strong> </strong></a><strong><a href="http://ladyfestten.com/">Ladyfest Ten</a></strong> &#8230; a &#8220;feminist self-defence&#8221; class I attended.</p>
<p>Arriving at Studio La Danza on Holloway Road, walking up the stairs past brightly coloured adverts for poledancing and LGBT ballroom dancing classes, in the mirror-walled second floor studio I met our smiling instructors, Sian and Lydia, two students from Goldsmiths College.</p>
<p>We moved chairs into a circle for a quick discussion about the class, and what feminist self-defence actually is, while Sian handed round flyers such as &#8216;Your Voice Is A Weapon: How To Use It,&#8217; and a cartoon diagram mercilessly depicting the weak, soft, vulnerable parts on any attacker.</p>
<p>Lydia and Sian had learned the techniques they were going to teach us when their student feminist society arranged for an instructor from Sweden to stage a practical demonstration at Goldsmiths. Feminist self-defence is an idea that has especially taken off in Sweden, the home of <strong>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</strong> and the VPK feminist socialist political party, who are calling for feminist self-defence to be taught to girls in schools.</p>

<p>Feminist self-defence, we were told, is a DIY grassroots movement of gender activists teaching simple self-defence techniques, &#8220;specifically tailored towards experiences of violence against women, trans and queer people.&#8221; We weren&#8217;t going to find competition-winning martial arts or &#8216;complicated Houdini style escapes&#8217; here; this was about simplicity and  practicality, using your natural reflexes to quickly get away, and maybe giving your attacker an injury or two to remember you by.</p>
<p>The most important part of this movement, and why I&#8217;d come along to the class, was that there would be no victim-blaming here. The Ladyfest programme asked <em>&#8216;Are you sick of being told not to walk on your own at night? Tired of hearing that it&#8217;s our fault if we get attacked if we&#8217;re alone and it&#8217;s dark?&#8217; </em>Having had several self-defence instructors who repeated the same tired old bullshit of &#8220;Well, I shouldn&#8217;t say this really but it&#8217;s their own fault if they get attacked out on their own, I know you girls like to look pretty, but&#8230;&#8221; and having also been sexually harassed at classes, this class was a refreshingly new experience for me.</p>
<p>For once, there was the acknowledgement that the burden should not be on women to protect themselves from rape, that this is not how things <em>should</em> be. One student remembered the time she&#8217;d been heartened to see in her inbox, instead of that cheery chain e-mail of the type we often receive, <em>&#8216;Women: how to protect yourself from rape! (Forward this to all your girlfriends!)&#8217;</em>, the variation <em><a href="http://www.thefword.org.uk/blog/2009/09/sexual_assault_3">&#8216;Rape Prevention Tips for Men&#8217;</a>.<br />
</em><br />
We started the practical part of the class by talking about personal space. How close does someone have to get for us to feel uncomfortable? &#8220;We&#8217;re so polite in this country,&#8221;  said Lydia. &#8220;We don&#8217;t complain.&#8221; We discussed how the size of our personal space decreases when we&#8217;re in a crowded area, on the train or at a gig, but what was emphasised was that although its size can change, we&#8217;re still entitled to our own space, and entitled to tell people to get out of it. Lydia and Sian pretended to be confident commuters  bumping into us, while we walked around looking shy, and then we switched roles. Less of a &#8216;This Is How You Must Act In Order Not To Be Attacked&#8217; than a lesson in where our personal boundaries lay, and a funny icebreaker for the class when we were allowed to &#8216;get revenge&#8217;  and barge into our instructors.</p>
<p>Something that especially impressed me was that our instructors acknowledged how practising for assault can be upsetting &#8211;  that people might have traumatically experienced the situations that were being described. Participation in the physical aspect of the class was not compulsory, they told us &#8211; if we felt upset we could go away and come back again and no-one would judge us, and every part of the class was explained to us before we took part.</p>
<p>The instructors were even respectful of each other&#8217;s boundaries, and yet the atmosphere in the class was much more lighthearted and pleasant than many self-defence classes that I have attended – “May I strangle  you, Lydia?” “Yes you may, Sian,” they laughed. There were horrible people and horrible situations out there, but we had the power to do something about it, and learning these techniques was going to be fun, too.</p>
<p>We practised shouting &#8211; useful for throwing an attacker off balance, alerting others who might help, and also something that can make your strikes stronger and help you to focus, in the manner of the Japanese <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiai">Kiai</a>.  Here, Lydia did a pretty scary impression of her Swedish instructor shouting &#8220;Nej!!&#8221; &#8211; I’m surprised no-one came upstairs to see what was happening! &#8211; but we used the English, &#8220;No!&#8221; and practised hitting boxing pads. Our instructors again emphasised how polite we are as women or minorities in this culture, how we&#8217;re afraid of causing a fuss, and how getting past that fear can be one of the best things we can ‘unlearn’ to  keep ourselves safe.</p>
<p>We were afraid to shout at first, but as our inhibitions dropped we became louder and louder. We shouted not once,  but twice, and when we struck, we struck twice, because we were told, if possible, “do it twice,” as that way there&#8217;s more chance of getting a  result. If shouting for help, Sian advised us not just to ask but to ask specific people – “Hey, you in the red bobble hat, this man won’t  take his hand off my leg, please alert the bus driver!” works because picking on individuals is better than asking a crowd, where everyone might assume that someone else will help you.</p>
<p>As an attacker is likely to be physically stronger than their victim (unless the attacker is feeling a tad suicidal), we were told not to  wrestle, not to use ‘might against might,’ but to find weak spots. We looked at the diagrams we’d been shown and practised using the strong  parts of our bodies, the heels of our hands, our fists, our feet, against the vulnerable parts of an attacker’s, their shins, their solar plexus, their throat. This wasn’t karate, this wasn’t the Marquess of Queensbury rules, this was fighting dirty, and fighting for your right to go about your life unharmed.</p>
<p>Sian and Lydia explained that we weren&#8217;t just practising for that shadowy figure that jumps out of the bushes, we were also practising close-quarters techniques, where you might not have the space to deliver that awesome roundhouse kick you saw on <strong>Buffy the Vampire Slayer,</strong> because sexual assault is much more likely to come from people we know  (friends, acquaintances, dates) than from strangers, and can happen  just as easily in your house, on your sofa, as in a dark alley somewhere.  This is where a lot of the anti-rape advice given by many self-defence instructors falls down! It’s no good saying ‘don’t walk alone at night’  when it could be your date who attacks you.</p>
<p>My one criticism of this class would be that they could have  explained a  little more about the specific experiences of  queer and  transgender  people, as these were mentioned on the programme, but as a  one-hour starter class it was full of great, general advice for people from all walks of life on how to avoid sexual or violent assault from a stronger attacker.</p>
<p>The class overran, there had been so much to say, but as we all quickly cleared out of the studio to get to the next Ladyfest event we  left our email addresses with Lydia. The nature of feminist self-defence, as a DIY movement, is that one takes what one has learned and passes it on. Lydia and Sian’s instructor had done so, and now the two of them were passing it on as well. They told us that they wanted to  prepare another class in London, and would contact us with details. I  handed round flyers for BadRep, having already mentioned I&#8217;d be writing about the class, and it was decided that our readers should contact Lydia and Sian if they were interested in another London-based class, or if interested in resources for starting their own classes elsewhere in the country. <strong>You can e-mail us at <a href="mailto:badrepeditors@gmail.com">badrepeditors@gmail.com</a> if you&#8217;re interested, and we&#8217;ll put you in touch.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FINALLY.  It&#8217;s a fortnight late, but I couldn&#8217;t <em>not</em> post about <a href="http://ladyfestten.com/"><strong>Ladyfest Ten</strong></a>.  Rather than reviewing the whole event  &#8211; there&#8217;s quite a few reviews floating around by now &#8211; I thought I&#8217;d just spotlight the best picks from my rucksack-hoard of discoveries.</p>
<p>For those for whom this blog is a First Foray into feminist websites, what is a Ladyfest? Well, they happen worldwide &#8211; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladyfest">here&#8217;s Wikipedia&#8217;s entry</a>.  Succinctly, they&#8217;re community-based arts and culture festivals focussed on women creating culture and campaigning for social change.  The first one was in 2000 in the US; today Ladyfests go on all over the world. This one, my first, was the decade-marker!</p>
<p>Sarah J, Jenni and I pitched up on the Saturday afternoon with &#8220;Rest of the Fest&#8221; tix.  I went for a wander in the stalls of the Lady Garden (you read that correctly).  Hence, without further ado:</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">FIVE THINGS I FOUND AT LADYFEST</h3>

<h3>1. FAT QUARTER MAGAZINE</h3>
<p>My friends, this thing is seriously badass. Give it your time. You won&#8217;t be disappointed.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>WHAT IS IT? </strong>Zines and self-produced magazines are a rich tradition in feminism, and they all come out to play for festivals. This was no exception &#8211; some doing the old school riot grrrl photocopied look, and some glossier efforts. This one, firmly in the latter category, really stood out.  Only two issues in since its 2009 inception, it&#8217;s <em>beautifully</em> designed, full colour, and fun. I swear, if BadRep was a print magazine, we&#8217;d be aspiring to be like this.</li>
<li><strong>WHY SHOULD I PAY ATTENTION? </strong>BECAUSE<strong>. </strong>LOOK AT IT. YOU WILL SEE WHY. Someone I spotted on the BadRep Twitter feed pronounced them the rightful heirs to the gap left by <a href="http://www.subtextmagazine.co.uk/">Subtext</a>, and I reckon they weren&#8217;t wrong.</li>

<h3>2. FOR BOOK&#8217;S SAKE</h3>
<p>Like reading? Interested in feminism? You&#8217;re welcome.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>WHAT IS IT? </strong>In their own words, <strong><a href="http://forbookssake.net/">For Books’ Sake</a> </strong>is <em>an intelligent but irreverent  website featuring books by and for independent women, including news,  reviews, features and interviews. Focusing mainly on female authors  (both upcoming and established), we review classic and modern books  across both fiction and non-fiction. </em>What really brought the coolness of this project home to me, though, was the moment I rounded a corner at Ladyfest and found myself standing smack bang in front of FBS writer <a href="http://forbookssake.net/2010/06/23/literary-loves-the-travelling-suitcase-library/">Jess Haigh&#8217;s Travelling Suitcase Library</a>, which is, essentially, a kind of Sisterhood of the Travelling Books &#8211; she hosts pop-up library sessions where the curious, interested and bookloving can meet, swap books, simply take books away (no membership necessary &#8211; it&#8217;s all done on trust), or talk books.</li>
<li><strong>WHY SHOULD I PAY ATTENTION? </strong> Because it&#8217;s a heartwarming project with serious soul, an open-arms approach to all sorts of writing from Penguin Classics to teen fiction, and an ethos of bonding people through books.  Over the desk, Jess spotted me covertly eyeing Marilyn French&#8217;s <strong>The Women&#8217;s Room</strong> in a &#8220;man, I really should read that at some point&#8221; way, smiled, and said, &#8220;That book right there?  The reason I became a feminist&#8221;. <em>That </em>caught my attention. Before long, <strong>Women&#8217;s Room</strong> and I were heading home together.  Cheers!</li>

</ul>
<h3>3. PAMFLET</h3>
<p>So what if everybody&#8217;s already heard of this zine. I am <em>fashionably</em> late to the party and you can all deal with it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>WHAT IS IT? </strong>I didn&#8217;t want to write a post about the stalls of Ladyfest without including one full-on, photocopied, more old school-stylin&#8217; zine. That zine &#8211; and choosing was hard &#8211; is <strong>Pamflet</strong>, who are a &#8220;<em>post-everything london girl-zine made by anna-marie, phoebe &amp; nick // photocopied pink n black since 2005</em>&#8220;.</li>
<li><strong>WHY SHOULD I PAY ATTENTION? </strong> Because it&#8217;s good to have zines in your life.  It&#8217;s good to put heart into your causes, hobbies, fandoms, to make your own soapboxes out of sticky tape, photocopier drums and internet. It&#8217;s the same vein of creativity-meets-sharing that leads people to make mixtapes (and if there&#8217;s not a post by me on the sheer joy of mixtaping at <em>some </em>point in the life of this blog, I&#8217;m Anne Widdecombe).</li>
<li><strong>WHERE CAN I GET MORE?</strong> <a href="http://pamfletzine.blogspot.com/">Here <strong>(blog)</strong></a>,<strong> </strong><a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2437622203">here (facebook)</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/pamflet">here (Twitter)</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. SHE MAKES WAR</h3>
<p>Well, this one&#8217;s a bit of a cheat.  You&#8217;ll have noted that we didn&#8217;t actually have tickets to the musical side of Ladyfest, BUT CONSIDER THIS PLUG MY ATONEMENT, for <strong>She Makes War</strong>, one of the acts that played, is awesome. And I&#8217;m making some noise about her here because while she wasn&#8217;t on a stall, I <em>was</em> blurting about her to Jenni while we were <em>browsing</em> the stalls, and besides, the Ladyfest buzz has since pushed me to buy her album, and that is what we blog editors call A TENUOUS LINK AND THEREFORE VIABLE. <em>Yes.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>WHAT IS IT? </strong>Great music.</li>
<li><strong>WHY SHOULD I PAY ATTENTION? </strong>She&#8217;s already sailing a soupstream of soundbites like  &#8220;special brand of gloom punk-pop&#8221;, &#8220;grimy angst-pop&#8221;, and so on, and you  know why that is, guys? It&#8217;s because she&#8217;s REALLY GOOD. Fans of PJ Harvey, Melissa Auf der Maur et al should particularly consider applying, but <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq7w9IXlBGM&amp;feature=player_embedded">I&#8217;ll just leave this taster-trailer-thinger here.</a></li>

</ul>
<h3>5. EDUCATION FOR CHOICE</h3>
<p>One of the few talks all three of us made it to, so I&#8217;m rounding this off with their call to action.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>WHAT IS IT? </strong>&#8220;<em>The only UK-based educational charity dedicated to enabling young people to make informed choices about pregnancy and abortion.</em>&#8220;</li>
<li><strong>WHY SHOULD I PAY ATTENTION? </strong>Because the amount of bogus &#8220;unbiased information on abortion&#8221; services out there is growing like mould in a petri, along with that worrying US trend for <a href="http://www.salon.com/life/broadsheet/2010/10/25/abortion/index.html">aggressive pickets like this</a>. Sarah C tweeted just as we left the talk to say that she&#8217;d passed one herself whilst out in central London. Do not want.</li>
