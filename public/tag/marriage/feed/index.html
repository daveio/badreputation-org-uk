										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I once spent three years researching a particular widow, on and off.</p>
<p>The Duchess at the centre of John Webster&#8217;s play <strong>The Duchess of Malfi</strong> (1612-13) acquires a lot of her edginess in the original play from the fact that her husband has died before the action begins. She is a young – and according to her brother Ferdinand, &#8220;lusty&#8221; – widow, whose combination of financial independence and sexual experience makes many in her vicinity nervous.</p>
<p>The equivalent man would be called &#8220;eligible&#8221;, and receive a lot of invitations from women with marriageable daughters. But a woman in the same situation becomes the subject of a campaign of surveillance and torture which ends in her death.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/W-is-for-Widow.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="4346" data-permalink="/2011/03/28/an-alphabet-of-feminism-23-w-is-for-widow/w-is-for-widow/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/W-is-for-Widow.jpg?fit=1418%2C1582&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1418,1582" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="W is for Widow" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/W-is-for-Widow.jpg?fit=268%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/W-is-for-Widow.jpg?fit=917%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4346" alt="A victorian woman dressed in black with a black bonnet, wearing a shawl made out of black net, surrounded by bags of money." src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/W-is-for-Widow-268x300.jpg?resize=268%2C300" width="268" height="300" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/W-is-for-Widow.jpg?w=268&amp;ssl=1 268w, https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/W-is-for-Widow.jpg?w=917&amp;ssl=1 917w, https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/W-is-for-Widow.jpg?w=1418&amp;ssl=1 1418w" sizes="(max-width: 268px) 100vw, 268px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>The more I worked on Webster’s play, the more I noticed that the Duchess was part of a much larger cultural anxiety around the figure of the widow in English literature. She’s an extreme case, admittedly: few other fictional widows end up eating apricots grown in horse dung, kissing the severed hand of their husband or being strangled on the orders of their lycanthropic and potentially incestuous twin brother.</p>
<p>But a continual low charge hums around widows, from the comic grotesque of Widow Twankey to the alluringly threatening Black Widows of gangster novels. Via the Wife of Bath, the Dowager Duchess of Grantham and Aouda from <strong>Eighty Days Around The World</strong>, to take a handful nearly at random.</p>
<p>Of course it alters across the eras, but time and time again, the figure of the widow acts as a focus for drama.</p>
<p>Sometimes the charge seems to derive from the fact that she is no longer dependent upon any man, or socially &#8220;explained&#8221; via her relationship to a father or husband. Sometimes it comes instead from the way a widow is seen as <em>over</em>-defining herself in relation to a man no longer present.</p>
<p>Either way, widows in literature often hold the potential to disrupt social order in a variety of ways.</p>
<h2>Widows and Pseudowidows</h2>
<p>This article, however, is not about widows. It is about women who are <em>not</em> widows. Or rather, women who aren’t widows whilst still looking, sounding, or acting like them.</p>
<p>When considering famous widows in literature, it struck me that two of the names that sprang to mind – Miss Havisham in Dickens&#8217;s <strong>Great Expectations</strong> and Olivia in Shakespeare&#8217;s <strong>Twelfth Night</strong> – don’t technically fit the criteria.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/missh.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="13848" data-permalink="/2013/10/22/veiled-threats-widows-and-pseudowidows-12/missh/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/missh.jpg?fit=620%2C413&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="620,413" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="missh" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/missh.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/missh.jpg?fit=620%2C413&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright  wp-image-13848" alt="missh" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/missh.jpg?resize=372%2C248" width="372" height="248" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Miss Havisham’s veil is worn to mourn the marriage that never happened, whilst Olivia’s is to remind her of her dead brother, whose memory stops her from wanting to receive suitors. Nonetheless, they both look to me as if they’re trying to take on the role, adopting some of the characteristics associated with grieving spouses.</p>
<p>They wear specific clothes to mark their separation from other people (and from their previous selves), withdraw from normal social life, and refuse to put themselves under the jurisdiction of men. Neither are exactly successful in their attempt to construct themselves positively within the role of a widow.</p>
<p>Miss Havisham has become an icon of &#8220;frustrated&#8221; and &#8220;twisted&#8221; womanhood, unsuccessful within the novel’s plot and the butt of jokes in subsequent culture. She becomes a “tragic” figure in both the classical and slang senses of the word: an image of wronged heroism in her own mind, and a sad bitter spinster to the world outside.</p>
<p>Her veil, usually a temporary garment to mark her passing between two states, becomes a fixture, blending with the cobwebs which now cover her wedding cake. In Miss Havisham, Dickens created a figure who memorably combines the revulsion and anxiety felt by Victorian (and later) society towards women who refuse to play out the social roles ascribed to them.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Charles_Robert_Leslie_Olivia.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="13846" data-permalink="/2013/10/22/veiled-threats-widows-and-pseudowidows-12/charles_robert_leslie_olivia/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Charles_Robert_Leslie_Olivia.jpg?fit=474%2C599&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="474,599" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Charles_Robert_Leslie,_Olivia" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Charles_Robert_Leslie_Olivia.jpg?fit=237%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Charles_Robert_Leslie_Olivia.jpg?fit=474%2C599&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright  wp-image-13846" alt="Charles_Robert_Leslie,_Olivia" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Charles_Robert_Leslie_Olivia.jpg?resize=284%2C359" width="284" height="359" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Olivia from <strong>Twelfth Night</strong> is similarly associated with a veil, at least at the beginning of the play. The first thing we hear about her is that for seven years the world “Shall not behold her face at ample view/ But, like a cloistress, she will veiled walk&#8230;all this to season/ A brother’s dead love, which she would keep fresh/ And lasting in her memory”.</p>
<p>When Viola (dressed as the male Cesario) manages to speak to her, Olivia prepares by putting her veil back on, setting up the comedy by-play in which Viola claims not to know who the lady of the house is, and the moment when Olivia pulls it back and demands “Look you, sir, such a one I was this present. Is’t not well done?”</p>
<p>Within the first act the grieving Olivia’s attempt to seclude herself is defeated by a combination of plot and Viola’s rhetorical skills. The play treats her mourning as one of the restrictive, self-imposed roles which so many of the characters are trapped in as the action begins. Orsino is locked into his schtick as self-obsessed Petrarchan lover, Sir Toby as the party knight who slinks home in the early hours of every morning, Malvolio as the image of Puritan rectitude and Olivia as the grieving veiled figure wandering inconsolably around her rooms as if her husband had just died.</p>
<p>These roles are all disrupted for the audience’s amusement and the characters’ correction during the ensuing scenes, with the play particularly conspiring to trick Olivia out of her image of herself as a grand widow. There’s an echo here of Miss Havisham, though in a very different key: women are not permitted to adopt the role of widow simply because they want to.</p>
<p>Both characters are diverted away from a successful performance as “pseudowidows” by the narratives in which they appear: Olivia to happy marriage and Miss Havisham to pathological bitterness and mockery.</p>
<h2>&#8216;A veil of wickedness&#8217;</h2>
<p>In fact we don’t have to rely on my close-reading of these fictional texts to find anxiety around women “playing” at being widows. That harping on Olivia wearing a veil and walking secluded from men “like a cloistress” brings another group of women into play, whose apparent freedom from male jurisdiction has produced anger and revulsion in various eras.</p>
<p>I don’t have space to examine the way in which nuns in the Middle Ages navigated the rhetoric of “brides of Christ” alongside the reality that many entered the community after the death of a husband, or their social position. But one particular case stands out amongst the criticism of female religious orders: the bishop of Olmüt’s attack on the Beguines.</p>
<p>These women, who lived together in small self-governing groups, taking few vows and following the Rule of no specific order, were the subject of a lot of criticism in the later thirteenth century. Bruno, the bishop in question, wrote to the pope in 1273 to demand they be suppressed.</p>
<p>In R.W. Southern’s words:</p>
<blockquote><p>he complained that&#8230;the women used their liberty as a veil of wickedness in order to escape the yoke of obedience to their priests and ‘the coercion of marital bonds’. Above all, he was indignant that young women should assume the status of widowhood against the authority of the Apostle who approved no widows under the age of sixty.</p></blockquote>
<p>The bishop was referring to verses in the New Testament book of 1 Timothy, in which instructions are given for the way the “order of widows” should be run and who should be admitted. These women, who worked for the church and were provided with support, should all be over the age of sixty, have a good reputation and previously carried out pious works.</p>
<p>Obviously “widow” has a technical significance in this Biblical passage, but I was fascinated by Bruno’s line of attack: that the young women of the Beguines were setting themselves up <em>as if</em> they were widows, and thus escaping male authority.</p>
<p>His metaphor of a &#8220;veil of wickedness&#8221; once again acts as a focus for male anxiety over women who won’t accept their assigned role.</p>
<p>In part two of this post, I&#8217;ll delve into widow imagery in modern TV and film, including <strong>The Gilmore Girls</strong> and <strong>Four Weddings and a Funeral</strong>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[It's hard to find a way to re-appropriate any of these ideas in a positive way. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Hodge-note:</strong> This rather special item from the archives was originally #22 in the <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/category/alphabet/" target="_blank">Alphabet series</a>, and got mostly written (and illustrated) before I heard the siren song of <strong>vitriol</strong> instead, with its rich murder and rage connotations. <a title="V is for Vitriol" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/03/21/an-alphabet-of-feminism-22-v-is-for-vitriol/" target="_blank"><strong>Vitriol</strong></a> was duly inducted into the Alphabet official rankings and <strong>Virgin</strong> languished like a vestal until we thought maybe she should see the light of day&#8230;</p>
<p>Here she is:</p>
<h6 style="text-align: center;">V</h6>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">VIRGIN</h2>
<blockquote><p>And your quaint honour turn to dust<br />
And into ashes all my lust&#8230;</p>
<p>Andrew Marvell, <strong>To His Coy Mistress </strong>c.1640s</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Virgin</em> has a comparatively straightforward etymology: it derives from the Latin <em>virgo </em>(= &#8216;maiden&#8217;), whence the star-sign Virgo (apparently the sign of the shy, modest and meticulous, with a dash of perfectionism and anxiety). Its first sense (c.1200) is an ecclesiastical one: &#8216;an unmarried or chaste maiden or women, distinguished for piety or steadfastness in religion, and regarded as having a special place among the members of the Christian church on account of these merits.&#8217;</p>
<h2>Like a virgin</h2>
<div id="attachment_13600" style="width: 189px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/saint-lucy.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13600" data-attachment-id="13600" data-permalink="/2013/06/03/v-is-for-virgin-alphabet-b-sides-and-rarities/saint-lucy/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/saint-lucy.jpg?fit=415%2C599&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="415,599" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Saint Lucy, 1521" data-image-description="&lt;p&gt;Saint Lucy, with her eyes, as depicted in 1521&lt;/p&gt;
" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/saint-lucy.jpg?fit=208%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/saint-lucy.jpg?fit=415%2C599&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-13600   " alt="Saint Lucy, with her eyes, as depicted in 1521" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/saint-lucy.jpg?resize=179%2C258" width="179" height="258" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-13600" class="wp-caption-text">Saint Lucy, with her eyes, as depicted in 1521</p></div>
<p>There are innumerable such virgins in Christian hagiography: Saint Ursula had an army of 11,000 virgin handmaids who all had their heads chopped off (in a bit of a pun-fail); Saint Cecilia (patron saint of music) managed not only to persuade her husband to forbear on their wedding night, but also to join the Christian cause along with his brother, and suffer death in consequence.</p>
<p>Saint Lucy consecrated her virginity to God, and, supposedly, tore her own eyes out and gave them to her husband (who had admired them) as a kind of macabre substitute for the marital debt. (Lesson: never admire your girlfriend&#8217;s essential organs).</p>
<p>And, of course, there is the arch-virgin much mentioned in these posts – the eponymous Mary, who gets a definition all to herself as <em>virgin</em>&#8216;s fourth meaning.</p>
<p>Mary&#8217;s particular achievement &#8211; the Virgin Birth &#8211; is also considered of some importance in these definitions for <em>virgin</em>. It presumably lies behind the gloss &#8216;a female insect producing fertile <a title="O is for Ovary" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/01/24/an-alphabet-of-femininism-15-o-is-for-ovary/" target="_blank">eggs</a> by pathenogenesis [without the input of a male insect]&#8217; (1883), as well as <em>virgin</em>&#8216;s simple equivalence with &#8216;pathenogenesis&#8217; itself (1849) &#8211; a word with its origin in the Greek <em>parthenos</em>, also meaning &#8216;virgin&#8217; and &#8216;genesis&#8217; (= &#8216;creation&#8217;).</p>
<p>This &#8211; reproduction without fertilisation &#8211; though clearly associated with Mary in Christian tradition, is also arguably the origin of Adam, so it doesn&#8217;t have to be have an explicit cultural gender-association. Indeed, there is a Middle English citation for <em>virgin </em>that defines it as <span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">&#8216;a youth or man who has remained in a state of chastity&#8217;. But this is admittedly an unusual example among the definitions as a whole. </span></p>
<h2>A woman&#8217;s touch</h2>

<p>If we go back to ancient Rome, we meet another sense the religious meaning of <em>virgin</em> can have: the very non-Christian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestal_Virgin" target="_blank">Vestal Virgins</a>, a group of highly respected women whose job it was to guard the &#8216;sacred fire&#8217; and take care of the rituals and responsibilities that could not be dealt with by male priests.</p>
<p>They were so named because their duties were primarily to Vesta, the Roman goddess of the hearth and family, and, in consequence, the Vestal Virgins took on a role as kind of symbolic housewives to the whole of Rome.</p>
<p>Though they would be obliged to remain <em>virginal </em>throughout their time as priestesses, in the word&#8217;s second sense &#8216;a woman who is or remains in a state of inviolate chastity&#8217;, the vow only lasted thirty years, at the end of which they were free to marry (though most of them seem not to have been all that bothered).</p>
<p>This all said, while these saints and priestesses are all very much <em>virgins </em>in the most common sense of the word, the ecclesiastical meaning does not have to imply the sexual inexperience they normally connote, since &#8216;chastity&#8217; simply means &#8216;clean, pure&#8217; (from the Latin <em>castus</em>), and has no intrinsic connection with physical &#8216;intactness&#8217;, though it is frequently used as a synonym. In fact, the fourth definition for the second primary meaning of the word (where it can be used to describe things other than women) highlights &#8216;purity or freedom from stain&#8217; and being &#8216;unsullied&#8217;.</p>
<p>If you cast your mind back to &#8216;<a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/01/10/an-alphabet-of-femininism-13-m-is-for-marriage/" target="_blank">M is for Marriage</a>&#8216;, you may remember that <em>adultery </em>means &#8216;pollution of the marriage bed&#8217;, suggesting by association that the marriage bed was a sacred – or indeed &#8216;pure&#8217; – space. And indeed, marriage was widely considered invalid without consummation – something Henry VIII made much use of in his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_of_Cleves#A_doomed_marriage" target="_blank">royal divorces </a>– and, in consequence, the virtuous wife who dexterously trod the balance of Pure Marital Sex and Pollution of the Marriage Bed (whether by adultery as we conceive it, or by lusting after her husband) could be as much feted as the unmarried <em>virgin </em>(indeed, more so, if she proved herself skilled in housewifery and produced equally virtuous children).</p>

<p>That said, a curious and related term first cited in 1644 was <em>virgin widow</em>, meaning a woman whose husband had died before the marriage could be consummated, and whose status was therefore ambiguously poised between <em>virginity </em>(in the sense of being unmarried) and <a title="W is for Widow" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/03/28/an-alphabet-of-feminism-23-w-is-for-widow/" target="_blank"><em>widowhood </em></a>(being left behind after the death of a husband).</p>
<p>This was <a title="LRB Catherine of Aragon" href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v33/n15/eamon-duffy/the-unlikeliest-loophole" target="_blank">Catherine of Aragon</a>&#8216;s position, as argued at her divorce hearing, during the painful period  after Prince Arthur&#8217;s death &#8211; languishing in a political and social limbo, waiting for something to happen, steadily running out of money and losing points on the marriage market.</p>
<h2>Purity is a virtue of the soul</h2>
<p>An excellent, though somewhat horrific, example of the noble wife trope is <a title="Lucretia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucretia" target="_blank">Lucretia</a>, the virtuous spouse of Collatine, whose rape by the royal prince Tarquin so outraged Rome that it led directly to the establishment of the Roman republic. As a wife, Lucretia is not a technical <em>virgin</em>, but she is (as Shakespeare puts it in the oft-forgotten early poem <strong>The</strong> <strong>Rape of Lucrece </strong>(1594)) &#8216;Collatine&#8217;s fair love, Lucrece the <em>chaste</em>&#8216;.</p>
<p>Saint <a title="Augustine" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo" target="_blank">Augustine</a> posits that &#8216;<a title="Augustine" href="http://faculty.washington.edu/miceal/lgw/lucretia/Augustine.html" target="_blank">purity is a virtue of the soul</a>&#8216;, and since body and soul are (in this reading) distinct, Lucrece can consummate her marriage while still retaining her essential &#8216;bodily sanctity&#8217; because she is free of polluting lust in the process.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Unfortunately, Collatine spends so much time bragging about his wife&#8217;s chastity to the bros in the camp that he invites trouble:</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Haply that name of &#8220;chaste&#8221; unhapp&#8217;ly set<br />
The bateless edge on [Tarquin&#8217;s] appetite</p>
<p>Shakespeare, <strong>The Rape of Lucrece</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Lucretia is so traumatised by Tarquin&#8217;s subsequent rape that she stabs herself rather than &#8216;live impure&#8217;, widely considered by the (male) world to be a Noble Decision. This led to her immortalisation in literature and philosophy as a perfect wife, but also prompted Augustine to engage in some terrible rape apologism in the service of his broader argument (</span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">&#8216;If she was adulterous, why praise her? if chaste, why slay her?&#8217;).</span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><br />
</span></p>
<h2>Saints and sieves</h2>
<p>It is presumably a version of this chastity-of-the-soul idea so beloved by Augustine that lies behind the story of Tuccia, the Vestal Virgin who proves her virginity by carrying water from the Tiber in a sieve without spilling a drop (<a title="Tuccia" href="http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/upload/img/moroni-vestal-virgin-tuccia-NG3123-fm.jpg" target="_blank">here she is </a>depicted in 1555 with the sieve itself, and wearing an outfit that leaves little to the imagination, chaste or otherwise).</p>
<p>I suppose the idea behind the sieve story is that something that would normally flow through the porous surface is maintained &#8216;intact&#8217;, perhaps representing the pure soul within a porous body. At any rate, it became a key symbol of virginity, most notably in the &#8216;Sieve Portrait&#8217; of the &#8216;<a title="Q is for Queen" href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/02/07/an-alphabet-of-femininism-17-q-is-for-queen/" target="_blank">Virgin Queen</a>&#8216; Elizabeth I, who is also cited in the Dictionary as a definition of <i>virgin </i>in herself.</p>
<p>The last citation given in the dictionary for <em>virgin</em>, with which we will end, is from 1780, as &#8216;a fortress or city that has never been taken or subdued&#8217;. This has an obvious resonance with Lucrece, and the ultimately martial tale her story becomes &#8211; another link between feminine &#8216;closedness&#8217; and men&#8217;s military convenience.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to find a way to re-appropriate any of these ideas in a positive way. But maybe this transferred definition or fortresses and cities should make us think about Elizabeth I, who at least made them work to her own military and political advantage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the third of <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/tag/lizzies-feminist-wedding-quest/">my series of guest posts</a> on the trials of being a feminist while getting married (previously: <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/01/26/guest-post-im-not-an-unwanted-gift-the-problems-with-being-given-away/">being given away</a>; <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/02/21/guest-post-shut-up-juliet-why-this-rose-is-thinking-of-keeping-her-name/">the Name Issue</a>), I’m going to take a look at the issues of bridesmaids, best men, hen parties and stag dos.</p>

I mean, you say bride, you think ‘bridesmaids’.  What wedding photographer doesn’t have a plethora of pictures of a girl in white, smiling, with five other women of varying ages in a terrifying shade of coral, looking less happy? If you&#8217;re the bride, you&#8217;re meant to be surrounded by loads of female extras being feminine and cooing about appearance and hair and The Dress and flowers – that’s what the media show. But I had a big issue when it came to my bridesmaids. I have a lot of friends and they are&#8217;t all female, and lots of them are in different groups and some are in different countries. In the end, I have a family member (stepsister), my best mate (who lives in South Korea) and a bridesman.</p>
<p>Yup, that’s right. I’ve known Dan since I was 18 and he knows me almost as well as my fiancé, so screw it, he’s in my bridal party. I have a bridesman.  There are actually some great sides to this. For one thing, like my fiancé, he doesn’t drink, so he&#8217;ll be very helpful in negotiating the family tensions on the day when it comes to the group photographs. For another, he’s great at calming me down and getting me to remember to have some perspective. And he’s funny and can cheer me up when I’m stressed and grumpy.</p>

It is seemingly ‘not done’ to have men in your wedding entourage if you&#8217;re a woman, I imagine because of women not having male friends in the same way in the old days, because, tradition implies, that would surely lead to romance.  (Although I have in fact slept with him. I am not revealing this fact to my mother.) A couple of other people have joked ‘Oh, in a dress?’ and I’ve just stared at them until they stop with their gender stereotyping.</p>
<p>The idea of just having your female friends is a lovely one but a little outdated when you a) know what sex is and don’t need your married friends telling you before your wedding night, and b) regularly talk to men without the worry that someone will see you and call you a strumpet. We’ve moved on as a society, haven’t we? It’s nicely balanced by the fact that Future Husband chose his sister as his best man. I love that our wedding party is made up of a mix of men and women on both sides.</p>
<p>It’s also nice to have an additional excuse for extra parties. I’ve always said I would have a Cock Party as well as a Hen Do. Future Husband is having a Doe Night as well as a Stag Do. Fine, we’ll segregate by gender but by god we’ll have both. It shakes it up from the normal alternative of one single party we could throw, but also means that I’m not just hanging out in a female-only group.</p>
<p>It’s not even that I’ve set out to be ‘controversial’ (my mother, yet again), it’s just that I couldn’t see how I could organise my wedding and not be non-gender biased. We have too many friends, male and female, to simply be that abrupt and schismatic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This was going to be a very light and fluffy post, raising an arched eyebrow at an interesting find, but over the course of writing this article I made some discoveries which made it seem less of a frippery. But more on that later. Let&#8217;s start at the beginning: I was browsing in a charity shop when I found a 1901 book (okay, fine, the 1903 reprint) with the incredible name <strong>The Spinster Book</strong>. Even brushing aside, for a moment, the hilarious and wonderful title &#8211; it’s amazing.</p>
<div id="attachment_9983" style="width: 563px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/spinstercover.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9983" data-attachment-id="9983" data-permalink="/2012/02/28/the-spinster-book/spinstercover/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/spinstercover.jpg?fit=2112%2C2816&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="2112,2816" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;3&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon PowerShot A480&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1329848506&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;6.6&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;400&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.033333333333333&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="spinstercover" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/spinstercover.jpg?fit=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/spinstercover.jpg?fit=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-9983  " title="spinstercover" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/spinstercover-768x1024.jpg?resize=553%2C737" alt="An old clothback book.

<p>I mean, just look at it. Look harder! It’s all lavender and embossing and gold leaf and a looking-glass (wonderfully implying ‘it could be YOU’). It’s an absolutely sodding gorgeous book: rough uncut paper edges on two sides, gold leaf on the top, strange red-and-black printing on the pages which reminds me a little of the <a title="Kelmscott Press" href="http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/teach/privatepress/kelmscott.html">Kelmscott Press</a> <a href="http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/teach/privatepress/gothicp48.html">facsimile</a> I own (made by William Morris. The most beautiful books since illuminated manuscripts. OHMIGOD read his Chaucer&#8230; *cough* Excuse me, I seem to have bibliophiled all over the place).</p>
<p>On closer inspection, <strong>The Spinster Book </strong>is basically a dating/courtship guide, which very much assumes that one should never, ever attempt to talk to the opposite gender like a normal human being. Indeed, it even seems to suggest that too many friendships with men put a woman in the &#8216;friend zone&#8217; forever:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;To one distinct class of women men tell their troubles and the other class sees that they have plenty to tell. It is better to be in the second category than in the first.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s a bit like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men_Are_from_Mars,_Women_Are_from_Venus"><strong>Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus</strong></a>, but due to being 111 years out of date it’s even more laughable. (And I absolutely love <a href="http://www.retronaut.co/2011/10/tips-for-single-women-1938/">dated dating advice</a> anyway.)</p>
<p>The chapter titles are a treat in themselves:</p>

Enquiring minds want to know</p></div>
<p>Buh. Duh&#8230;. whu? A man being self-<em>centred</em> is actually self<em>less</em>, because he’s only doing it to be adorable. So lighten up and adore him some more, regardless of how conceited he is? Can&#8230; can I get an irony check on this?</p>
<p>My instinct when dealing with writing from the past (rightly or wrongly) is to assume the chance of satire is reduced the longer ago the text comes from (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Modest_Proposal">Jonathan Swift</a>, forgive me). However, for most of <strong>The Spinster Book</strong>, I’m realising a grain of salt is the way forward. This book does appear, at times, to be Jane Austen-wry, and puts forward some things with a fanciful glibness:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;After the door of a woman&#8217;s heart has once swung on its silent hinges, a man thinks he can prop it open with a brick and go away and leave it. A storm is apt to displace the brick, however &#8211; and there is a heavy spring in the door. Woe to the masculine finger that is in the way!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8211; Chapter 4, The Lost Art of Courtship</p></blockquote>
<p>But at the same time, it treads the difficult line of mocking some concepts whilst <em>also</em> giving some advice very seriously. I mean, come on, we’re playing for keeps. ‘Do you want to be a spinster? No? Then listen up. No talking at the back. It could be you. It could be YOOOU.’</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a lingering assumption throughout this book that both parties are playing a pretty nasty game of chess:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;He who would win a woman must challenge her admiration, prove himself worthy of her regard, appeal to her sympathy – and then wound her. She is never wholly his until she realises that he has the power to make her miserable as well as to make her happy, and that love is an infinite capacity for suffering.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8211; Chapter 4, The Lost Art of Courtship</p></blockquote>
<p>(Also: lucky girl. Jesus.)</p>
<p>A lot of the book has this kind of masochistic, ‘love is pain’ tone throughout &#8211; sometimes in understandable ways and sometimes completely out of the blue. Advice, advice, advice&#8230; misery and masochism sneak attack! For example, the final sentence of the &#8216;love letters&#8217; chapter is “So the old love letters bring happiness after all – like the smile which sometimes rests upon the faces of the dead.”</p>
<p>So, yes, I was unsure what to make of this tone. Then our lovely editor Googled the author, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myrtle_Reed"><strong>Myrtle Reed</strong></a>, and some more information fell into place. By all accounts, Reed was well-known and admired in her own time. She was the author of some thirty books, which included cookbooks (published under the name Olive Green) and novels under her real name &#8211; the best known of which is probably <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavender_and_Old_Lace"><strong>Lavender and Old Lace</strong></a>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Quick Bio:</span></p>
<p>1874: Born<br />
1899: First novel published (she continued to publish at least one a year, sometimes more)<br />
1901: <strong>The Spinster Book</strong> was published when she was 27<br />
1906: Married James Sydney McCullough, a penpal, at the unusually late age of 32<br />
1911: Died of a deliberate overdose of sleeping pills/powders aged 37.</p>
<p>Her <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F50912FD3E5517738DDDA00994D0405B818DF1D3">suicide note</a>, addressed to her maid, stated “If my husband had been as good and kind to me and as considerate as you, I would not be going where I am”. Horrible and sad, but also increasingly eerie from an author whose most famous epigram is this:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The only way to test a man is to marry him. If you live, it&#8217;s a mushroom. If you die, it&#8217;s a toadstool.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8211; <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/31272/31272-h/31272-h.htm"><strong>Threads of Gray and Gold</strong></a> (pub. 1913)</p></blockquote>
<p>No one on the outside knew of anything bad within their marriage. Indeed, according to Annie, Myrtle Reed’s maid, she “had never heard Mrs McCullough [née Reed] quarrel with her husband during the four years she had been at their home.” It’s useless to guess what lay behind it, or how much was a depressive tendency (which certainly seems to show in <strong>The Spinster Book</strong>), how much was a bad relationship and how much was a clearly intelligent and ambitious woman feeling desperate and trapped in a society which didn’t have many roles for women.</p>

<p>I don’t really know how to end this post. It started with a brilliant charity shop find which had me so hyped I that was reading passages aloud to my flatmate on the tube until he pretended he didn’t know me… and it’s ended with a bit of a reality-check, I suppose.</p>
<p>Although she never states in as many words that she herself is a spinster, Reed was writing the book at age 27 – <a href="http://www.wisegeek.com/how-has-the-average-age-at-marriage-changed-over-time.htm">five years past a woman’s usual marrying age</a>. By the standards of her time, she <em>was</em> now a spinster, and was presumably preparing herself for the future. The advice I saw as laughable &#8211; that being a spinster isn’t so bad as a woman might yet find herself a nice widower &#8211; was, perhaps, Myrtle Reed’s actual hope.</p>
<p>The chapter ‘The Consolations of Spinsterhood’ does mention &#8220;the dazzling allurements offered by various “careers” which bring fame and perhaps fortune&#8221;, but it quickly goes on to show just how little consolation Reed considers these to be:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The universal testimony of the great, that fame itself is barren &#8230; it is love for which she hungers, rather than fame&#8230;. If she were not free to continue the work that she loved, she would feel no deprivation.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Although she was a successful and prolific novelist in her own time, the stigma of spinsterhood would have seemed to erode the achievements she had rightfully earned. Reed implies heavily in <strong>The Spinster Book</strong> that she would have traded it all in for a husband. Except that when she did eventually marry, that clearly didn&#8217;t make her happy either.</p>

<p>As much as I love mocking dating advice (old and new) for any hint of gendered assumptions, Myrtle Reed didn’t ‘opt in’ to play by those rules. In 1901 there wasn’t an ‘opt out’. And shame on me for finding the topic so hilariously trivial in the first place. <strong>Check your 21st century privilege, Hannah</strong>. If I’d lived in a time and a society where marriage was my home, my job, my finances, my legal rights and my love life all rolled into one – you bet your arse I’d agonise over it. I’d probably buy a few books on the topic too. For every snide, ironic, 21st century reader, there were probably dozens of contemporary readers poring over this book’s advice and worrying about their futures. I, on the other hand, have freedom and choices and don’t have to play nasty games to secure a man to secure my future stability – but you don’t have to go back even half as far as Reed’s time to find women who did have to work within this crapshoot of a system. Whilst artefacts like <strong>The Spinster Book</strong> make interesting time-pieces, we should never forget that many of us who stumble across it now are the lucky ones – and that our privilege is incredibly rare.</p>
<p>And I guess that’s one of the main reasons why I’m a feminist in the first place.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the second of <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2012/01/26/guest-post-im-not-an-unwanted-gift-the-problems-with-being-given-away/">my guest series</a> on the trials of being a feminist while getting <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/01/10/an-alphabet-of-femininism-13-m-is-for-marriage/">married</a>, I’m going to take a look at dealing with people’s expectations when you&#8217;re not going along with even the most mainstream of wedding traditions. For example, not taking his name (or hers).</p>
<div id="attachment_9849" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/myname.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9849" data-attachment-id="9849" data-permalink="/2012/02/21/guest-post-shut-up-juliet-why-this-rose-is-thinking-of-keeping-her-name/myname/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/myname.jpg?fit=375%2C500&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="375,500" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="myname" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/myname.jpg?fit=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/myname.jpg?fit=375%2C500&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-9849 " title="myname" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/myname.jpg?resize=300%2C400" alt="Photo by flickr user ninasaurusrex, shared under creative commons licence.

<p>Oh, it’s a little thing, I grant you. One word. And it’s so innocuous that most people don’t even think it’s an issue. When we got engaged, we got cards addressed to ‘The Future Mr &amp; Mrs HisLastName’. One friend remarked she couldn’t wait to address her first Christmas card to ‘the HisLastNames’. Another asked if we were looking forward to be announced at our reception as ‘Mr and Mrs HisLastName’. Each time, I’m afraid I&#8217;ve shot them down brusquely – even though I’m still deciding what to do.</p>
<p>Why? Well, for starters, I’ve had 30 years of being Lizzie MyLastName, not Lizzie His. It sounds weird to me, like I’m playacting someone else. I’d have to change my passport, my bills, my driver’s licence, my personal emails, my work email, my Facebook &#8211; it’s too much damn work. And the biggest reason for my uncertainty: why should I have to literally rename myself to my husband’s last name when I get married? What’s so special about him? (Note: Obviously he’s very special or I wouldn’t be marrying him, yadda yadda don’t take the ring back).</p>
<p>The looks and comments I get when I say these things are rooted in blustering British patriarchal tradition. I’ve had ‘But that’s just what you <em>do</em>’, ‘Just change it in your personal life, you don’t have to change your professional name’ and ‘But don’t you <em>want</em> the same name as your husband and children?’.</p>
<p>Um, maybe, if I planned on having any children. But he could change his name. My name is perfectly lovely. And quite frankly, if we did have kids, plenty of people would call me Mrs HisLastName without me ever having to change it. And for the person who said ‘But that’s just what you do’ (hi, mum! I forgive you because you gave birth to me), we used to put lead in cans, but hey, we changed our way of doing things! As <a href="http://www.stylist.co.uk/people/lucy-mangan/ill-never-take-my-husbands-last-name">Lucy Mangan said</a>, “I’ve only known him six years. How come he gets to obliterate my history?”</p>
<p>So, what to do? If I don’t want to change my name to his, equally he doesn’t want to change it to mine. People have suggested hyphenating, which is what we would usually do – but alas, our name is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoonerism">spoonerism</a> that equates to ‘a bird’s balls’, so that’s not the ideal option after all. I quite like the idea of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau">portmanteau</a>-ing our name because it sounds like ‘Baroque’; clearly the most awesome outcome. But he thinks that sounds a bit fake. So, future husband and I are on a quest to find a new name that we can both change to. And in an example of patriarchy working for women instead of against them, this is easier and cheaper for me to do. He has to change it by deed poll – I just have to sign my new name on the marriage licence.</p>
<p>I’m secretly convinced that this will not happen. Family pressure will mean he keeps his name – plus, his profession of author spills into his personal life, so changing his surname is not the most sensible thing to do. And my name actually sounds great with his last name. But while it doesn’t make a whole lot of logical sense to insist on keeping one man’s name (my father’s) instead of taking another’s, equally I don’t want to have a visible sign that I am subsuming my identity into his and becoming ‘the wife’. I’m sure we will make a decision – but more late night discussions and trying out new signatures may be required.</p>

<h3>Starry Starry Night</h3>
<p>All together now: THE LAST ALPHABET POST EVER. And it&#8217;s a word with one of the longest definitions I&#8217;ve yet come across: <em>zone</em>, first cited in 1500, from the Latin <em>zona </em>and the Greek <em>zone</em>, which originally means &#8216;girdle&#8217;.</p>
<div id="attachment_3045" style="width: 226px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Cranach-venus.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3045" data-attachment-id="3045" data-permalink="/2011/04/18/an-alphabet-of-feminism-26-z-is-for-zone/cranach-venus/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Cranach-venus.jpg?fit=1000%2C2280&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1000,2280" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Venus and Cupid" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Cranach-venus.jpg?fit=131%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Cranach-venus.jpg?fit=449%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-3045   " src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Cranach-venus.jpg?resize=216%2C493" alt="Venus naked except for a girdle and some necklaces, by Lucas Cranach the Younger c.1540" width="216" height="493" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Cranach-venus.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Cranach-venus.jpg?w=131&amp;ssl=1 131w, https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Cranach-venus.jpg?w=449&amp;ssl=1 449w" sizes="(max-width: 216px) 100vw, 216px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-3045" class="wp-caption-text">Blame him. He stole my clothes. Venus and her cestus, Lucas Cranach the Younger (1540s)</p></div>
<p>Its complexity is mainly owing to the range of disciplines that have claimed it for their own; these include astrology, astronomy, physical geography, mathematics, poetry, and crystallography. Its immediate practical meaning is geographical: &#8216;Each of the five &#8216;belts&#8217; or encircling regions, differing in climate, into which the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn and the Arctic and Antarctic circles divide the surface of the earth&#8217; – that is, &#8216;the <em>torrid</em> (burning) zone between the tropics, the (north and south) <em>temperate zones </em>extending from the tropics to the polar circles, and the <em>frigid </em>(frozen) zones<em> </em>(arctic and antarctic) within the polar circles&#8217;.</p>
<p>A <em>zone</em>, then, is a &#8216;belt&#8217; that marks out space, enclosing and dividing at once, as reflected in its vaguer sense from 1559 as &#8216;any region extending round the earth and comprised between definite limits&#8217;, where it is also applied to &#8216;a similar region in the heavens or on the surface of a planet&#8217;.</p>
<p>Of course, the Ancient Egyptians gave the practical sky-based role of <em>zoning </em>to a woman –<em> Nut</em>, the goddess of the sky, married to the earth god Geb (an unusual gendering). Nut is depicted throughout Egyptian art as a naked woman arched over the earth, balancing on her fingertips and tiptoes, and often covered in stars, from which position she protects the sun god Ra, and the earth below – a <em>zone </em>in its fourth sense (from 1591), as &#8216;a circumscribing or enclosing ring, band, or line&#8217;. Whence it is but a short step to 1608&#8217;s contribution to the party, <em>zone</em> as &#8216;a girdle or belt, as part of a dress&#8217; (chiefly &#8216;poetical&#8217;), which is really the only literal use for the word: before the word&#8217;s adoption into English, Ancient Greek women wore a &#8216;<em>zona</em>&#8216; under their clothes to accentuate the figure.<br />
<BR></BR></p>
<h3>Alas! My Girdle!</h3>
<p>So we end where we began: with an <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/10/04/an-alphabet-of-femininism-1-a-is-for-amazon/">extra-snazzy belt</a>. Women&#8217;s girdles have a long and varied history going back to the <em><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cestus">cestus</a> </em>or &#8216;Belt of Venus&#8217;, an ill-judged wedding present to the Goddess of Love from her husband Hephaestus which rendered her irresistible to men (and, appropriately, endures on as an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_of_Venus">astronomy term</a>). Martial refers to the <em>cestus </em>in his Epigrams as &#8216;a cincture that kindled love in Jupiter&#8217; (planetary theme ftw), and clearly considered it quite hot stuff himself, since it was &#8216;&#8230;still warm from Venus&#8217; fire&#8217;.</p>
<p>The Medieval West was not to be left behind in all this sexy-talk: no right-thinking female of the thirteen-hundreds considered herself fully sexed-up without a <em>gipon</em>, a type of corset designed to flatten the breasts and emphasise the stomach. And in case this proved insufficient, she might also pad her belly out for extra effect – well-rounded bellies <a href="http://cgfa.acropolisinc.com/eyck/eyck6.jpg">appear</a> <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Les_Tres_Riches_Heures_du_duc_de_Berry_avril_detail.jpg">again</a> and <a href="http://storage.canalblog.com/15/58/119589/34529891.jpg">again</a> in contemporary art – and, as with the Cranach Venus (above), a decorative <em>zone </em>was the perfect way to emphasise its shape, making this a garment no less sexually charged in the 1340s than the <a href="http://www.girdlezone.org/">1940s</a> (when, of course, its job was to hold the belly <em>in</em>). Like a <em>garter</em>, then, a <em>girdle </em>could serve as a fetishistic focal point for erotic (and indeed erogenous) <em>zones</em>, marking them out and keeping them restrained at the same time.</p>

<p>The Dictionary seems to have picked up something of this atmospheric heat itself, and brings us all back to earth by citing for this sense of the word Francis Quarles&#8217; <strong>Emblem VIII</strong> (&#8216;Shall these coarse hands untie / The sacred zone of thy virginity?&#8217; (1635)). Neatly, this citation highlights the flip-side of <em>zone</em>&#8216;s erotic focus – the Roman marriage ceremony famously culminated in the groom untying his wife&#8217;s girdle (enduring into the thigh-rubbing Latin slang phrase &#8216;<em>zonam solvere</em>&#8216; – &#8216;to untie the girdle&#8217;).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the <em>chastity belt</em> (which also encompasses the &#8216;torrid zone between the tropics&#8217;, if you want to be vulgar about it) supposedly made its debut in Western society during the Crusades, lest the mice should play while the cats were off murdering Muslims. They may have been a niche market then, but – under the waggish and consistent alias &#8216;Venus&#8217; belt&#8217; – they were certainly widespread enough by the sixteenth century to become a target for satire. It was not until 1718 that English got the separate word <em>zoned</em>, but its meaning – &#8216;wearing a zone or girdle, hence, chaste&#8217; – was clearly familiar to Francis Quarles, although he&#8217;s not talking about a literal woman, but about the relationship between body and soul.</p>
<p>John Donne plays with this conceit in his <strong><a href="http://www.luminarium.org/sevenlit/donne/elegy20.htm">Elegy: To His Mistress Going To Bed</a></strong>, which famously describes the &#8216;mistress&#8217; in question as &#8216;my America&#8217;. Her &#8216;girdle&#8217; glitters like &#8216;heaven&#8217;s <em>zone</em>&#8216; (viz.: the celestial sphere), but the woman&#8217;s body is itself a &#8216;world&#8217;, a &#8216;new-found land&#8217;, and the speaker&#8217;s &#8216;roving hands&#8217; explorers in a &#8216;kingdom&#8217; – just as in<strong><a href="http://www.luminarium.org/sevenlit/donne/sunrising.htm"> The Sun Rising</a></strong>, &#8216;she&#8217;s all states, and all princes I&#8217;. It&#8217;s not just Donne (<a href="http://www.luminarium.org/sevenlit/carew/rapture.htm">Thomas Carew</a> did it too): think how many landmarks are claimed for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sleeping_Lady">sleeping giantesses</a>, using the female body to map out geographical <em>zones</em>, just as geographical <em>zones</em> can be used to map out a woman (what else is the <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mons_pubis">mons veneris</a></em>?), and think back to <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_2709_2.jpg">Sir Francis Dashwood, landscaping pudendas in his garden</a>.</p>
<p>Much like the <em>zone </em>itself, this Alphabet has tried to encompass various notions of womanhood. Come back soon and maybe there&#8217;ll be a final post mortem-style analysis&#8230; </p>

<p>Ahem. <em>Yes </em>is the last of our Old English words. It&#8217;s <em>gise </em>or <em>gese, </em>meaning &#8216;so be it&#8217;, perhaps from <em>gea, ge </em>(= &#8216;so&#8217;), plus <em>si</em> (=&#8217;be it!&#8217;), the third person imperative of <em>beon</em> (= &#8216;to be&#8217;). In this form, <em>yes</em> was stronger than its Germanic cognate, <em>yea </em>(much like today) and, apparently, was often used in Shakespeare as an answer to negative questions. We could do with one of them nowadays, no? How many times have you answered a question with <em>yes </em>when you mean <em>no</em>? (&#8216;Doesn&#8217;t she&#8230;.?&#8217; &#8216;&#8230;Yes, she doesn&#8217;t&#8217;).</p>
<p>The penultimate word in our Alphabet, <em>yes </em>is frequently one of the first words we learn on earth; its meaning is clear and unequivocal, by turns disastrous, passionate, exhilarating, loaded and humdrum &#8211; but always positive in the full sense of that word. It is almost invariably repeated, as in Joyce (and Usher) &#8211; &#8216;yes I will, Yes&#8217;, the successive affirmations underlining and confirming the first &#8211; just like a <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=W7eLlRE-5OwC&amp;pg=PA253&amp;lpg=PA253&amp;dq=ulysses+gramophone+hear+say+yes+in+joyce&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OCKYHR7yyY&amp;sig=Y5Za4Hwk3Sfp2sFGKGxS0xR5Nfw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=9MbzTNvyEOCAhAfmrJCLDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=ulysses%20gramophone%20hear%20say%20yes%20in%20joyce&amp;f=false">signature</a> under your printed name, if you listen to Derrida</p>
<h3>Sure &#8216;Nuff n&#8217; Yes I Do</h3>
<p>James &#8216;<a href="http://www.bedeutung.co.uk/theblog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/james_joyce.jpg">Awesome Glasses</a>&#8216; Joyce apparently made much of his novel &#8216;novel&#8217; <strong>Ulysses</strong> ending on this, which he considered &#8216;the female word&#8217;. The final chapter, &#8216;Penelope&#8217;, often also referred to as &#8216;Molly Bloom&#8217;s soliloquy&#8217;, is 42 pages of just eight sentences, wherein Molly, wife of Leopold Bloom, muses to herself in bed.</p>
<p>For those who have better things to do than wrestle with a modernist doorstop, as the wife of the novel&#8217;s &#8216;Ulysses&#8217;, Molly is a counterpart to &#8216;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penelope">Penelope</a>&#8216;, wife of Odysseus / Ulysses and conventional model of <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/03/28/an-alphabet-of-feminism-23-w-is-for-widow/">marital fidelity</a>. The similarity expires fairly quickly, since Joyce&#8217;s Penelope is having an affair with &#8216;Blazes Boylan&#8217;, but nonetheless her chapter is often named after Ulysses&#8217; wife. It begins and ends with this <em>yes</em>, and in a letter to Frank Budgen, Joyce explained that &#8216;Penelope&#8217; rotates around what he considered the four cardinal points of the female  body &#8211; &#8216;breasts, arse, womb and cunt&#8217; &#8211; expressed respectively by the words <em>because, bottom, woman</em> and <em>yes</em>. Some of the comparisons are clear – the <em><a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/03/14/an-alphabet-of-feminism-21-u-is-for-uterus/">womb</a></em> has long been seen as synonymous with &#8216;woman&#8217; (however reductively); <em>bottom / arse –</em> ok; <em>because / breasts&#8230; </em>um?; <em>yes / cunt – </em>hmm.</p>
<p>I suspect this last pairing has a lot to do with the affirmation of sex: interaction with this organ <strong>should</strong> be one preceded by <em>yes </em>and punctuated with repetitions of this confirmation (<em>yes yes yes</em>). (Why James Joyce, you filthy&#8230;). We see a similar thing in Usher (first time for everything): the repeated <em>yeah, yeah, yeah </em>is a sexual affirmation – &#8216;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiXbRBS5Z58">How the hell am I supposed to leave??</a>&#8216;. This is about a female seduction (&#8216;she&#8217;s saying &#8220;come get me&#8221;!&#8217;), but one that we suspect will not end in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCss0kZXeyE">when-i&#8217;m-sixty-four</a> style knitting by the fire. For one thing, we learn that Usher already has a &#8216;<a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/11/15/an-alphabet-of-femininism-7-g-is-for-girl/">girl</a>&#8216;, who happens to be &#8216;the best of homies&#8217; with this club seductress; for another, Ludacris announces they will leave after a couple of drinks because they &#8216;want a <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/12/20/an-alphabet-of-femininism-12-l-is-for-lady/">lady</a> in the street but a freak in the bed&#8217;. So actually, the art of being a <em>lady </em>lies in effectively concealing a consent that, in private, becomes loud, repeated and unstoppable.</p>
<h3>Yes Indeed</h3>

The 'Easy Girlfriend' Poster, 1943-4</p></div>
<p>This is a well-trodden path, and all part of the old idea of how consent given too easily (<em>yes yes yes</em>) – or, in some cases, even given at all – is liable to get females into trouble. A less well-trodden example is Richardson&#8217;s <strong>Sir Charles Grandison </strong>(1753), which devotes several hundred of its thousand or so pages to what happens after the protagonist has proposed to his fiance: though she has accepted the proposal, she fears that to &#8216;name the day&#8217; herself – or even to consent to a &#8216;day&#8217; suggested to her – would be to show a forwardness disturbing in a woman. Disturbing perhaps, but probably a relief to the exhausted reader, for she manages to suspend her final consent to &#8216;thursday a month hence&#8217; for an entire blushing, confused volume of this hefty tome.</p>
<p>We can go further back, of course: in Shakespeare-times, Juliet fears Romeo will think she is &#8216;too quickly won&#8217;. To correct this, she offers to &#8216;frown, and be perverse, and say thee <em>nay</em>&#8216; (<em>no no yes</em>), artificially constructing a well-won consent where positive affirmation already exists (history does not record whether or not Juliet was &#8216;a freak in the bed&#8217;). Many would-be Romeos have seized on such fears to assume (or convince themselves) that this is just what their ladies are doing when they give an unequivocal &#8216;no&#8217;, so seduction narratives are littered with lovers assuming their lovers really mean <em>yes </em>when they reply in the negative<em> – </em>examples have spanned Austen&#8217;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWx7AF8B0R8&amp;feature=related">Mr Collins</a> to modern day Mills &amp; Boon. Apparently, in the latter case, one is supposed to find this irresistible.</p>
<h3>Go No More A-Roving</h3>
<p>We&#8217;re teetering around something rather insidious here, and one aspect of this finds its expression in a 1940s propaganda poster. The &#8216;Easy Girlfriend&#8217; anti-VD advert placed the blame for the Second World War venereal epidemic squarely with the momento-mori type be-hatted skull (a sexually experienced re-appropriation of the medieval <a href="http://www.abcgallery.com/B/baldung/baldung16.JPG">Death and the Maiden</a> trope). &#8216;The &#8220;easy&#8221; girlfriend spreads syphilis and gonorrhea&#8217;, it blazed – she who says <em>yes </em>too easily is to be shunned by polite society, and will be – <em>naturellement </em>– riddled with disease. Of course, syphilis&#8217; original spread throughout Europe had followed the path of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Tour">Grand Tour</a>, but this must have been because Venetian prostitutes were taking expensive package holidays throughout France, Spain, Rome, Switzerland and Turkey, mustn&#8217;t it, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Byron">Lord Byron</a>?</p>
<p>So while you probably disagree with Joyce&#8217;s view that <em>yes </em>is an intrinsically female word, it&#8217;s certainly one whose utterance is littered with potential problems for women. <em>Yes </em>means <em>yes. </em></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center">WIDOW</h2>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ll say one thing: the war makes the most peculiar widows.</p>
<p>Rhett Butler, <strong>Gone With The Wind </strong>(1939)</p></blockquote>
<h3>Bootylicious</h3>
<p><em>Widow </em>is another Old English word, <em>widewe</em> (= widow&#8230;), which connects via the Indo-European <em>vidhava</em>, with the Latin <em>viduus</em>, meaning &#8216;bereft&#8217; or (its other lexical descendent) &#8216;void&#8217;. This &#8216;vacancy&#8217; at the etymological heart of the word seems perfect, if rather sad, since (as we all know) a widow is &#8216;a woman who has lost her husband by death and has not married again&#8217;.</p>
<div id="attachment_4526" style="width: 278px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/446px-Queen_Victoria_photographed_by_George_Washington_Wilson_1863.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4526" data-attachment-id="4526" data-permalink="/2011/03/28/an-alphabet-of-feminism-23-w-is-for-widow/446px-queen_victoria_photographed_by_george_washington_wilson_1863/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/446px-Queen_Victoria_photographed_by_George_Washington_Wilson_1863.jpg?fit=446%2C599&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="446,599" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Queen Victoria on a horse" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/446px-Queen_Victoria_photographed_by_George_Washington_Wilson_1863.jpg?fit=223%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/446px-Queen_Victoria_photographed_by_George_Washington_Wilson_1863.jpg?fit=446%2C599&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-4526 " src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/446px-Queen_Victoria_photographed_by_George_Washington_Wilson_1863.jpg?resize=268%2C359" alt="A grumpy-looking Queen Victoria, wearing black, sits on a horse with a man in a kilt holding the reins." width="268" height="359" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/446px-Queen_Victoria_photographed_by_George_Washington_Wilson_1863.jpg?w=446&amp;ssl=1 446w, https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/446px-Queen_Victoria_photographed_by_George_Washington_Wilson_1863.jpg?w=223&amp;ssl=1 223w" sizes="(max-width: 268px) 100vw, 268px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-4526" class="wp-caption-text">'The Widow at Windsor' - Queen Victoria in 1863, after Albert's death in 1861</p></div>
<p>Anyway, the emptiness immanent in the word <em>widow </em>is materially rather ironic, since, in European history at least, a lucky woman whose family had thrashed out a good <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/01/10/an-alphabet-of-femininism-13-m-is-for-marriage/">dower-deal</a> at her marriage was, in theory, entitled to most of the death-booty – as long as she didn&#8217;t marry Shakespeare and end up with the &#8216;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Hathaway_(Shakespeare)#Shakespeare.27s_Will">second best bed</a>&#8216;, or fall foul of anti-female legalities (as in Austen&#8217;s <strong>Sense and Sensibility</strong>).</p>
<p>But if we assume all has gone right and your wealthy husband has obligingly shuffled off this mortal coil and done nothing unexpected with his will, <em>widowhood </em>comes with a golden handshake. Even a little bit of money leaves you with a degree of important independence, and historical <em>widows</em> have frequently exploited this, becoming, in some instances, iconic political figures. Notable <em>widows</em> of history have included: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiang_Qing">Jiang Qing</a>, wife of Chairman Mao and leader of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang_of_Four_(China)">Gang of Four</a>; the dowager <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_de'_Medici">Catherine de Medici</a>, who machinated throughout the French Wars of Religion; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrippina_the_Younger">Agrippina the Younger</a>, super-Freudian mother of Nero; late-period <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> (dubbed &#8216;The Widow at Windsor&#8217;); <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Parr">Catherine Parr</a>, Henry VIII&#8217;s last wife (and the most married queen in English history), whose main distinction is that she &#8216;survived&#8217; &#8230; and even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacqueline_Kennedy_Onassis">Jackie Kennedy Onassis</a>, if you&#8217;re into that sort of thing.</p>
<h3>Scottish Widows</h3>
<p>On a more casual note, the independent <em>widow </em>was a culturally significant figure throughout European history, often dubbed the <strong>Merry Widow</strong>, as was the eponymous heroine of Franz Lehár&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Merry_Widow">operetta</a> (1905). Not only does Lehár&#8217;s <em>widow</em> have her own <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ5ekXKMjws">theme tune</a>, she also sparked a self-titled <a href="http://edwardianpromenade.com/fashion/the-merry-widow/">hat-craze</a>, and attentive readers will note that this &#8216;ornate or wide-brimmed hat&#8217; is worn at a <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/02/14/an-alphabet-of-femininism-18-–-r-is-for-rake/">rakish</a> angle that rather suits <em>Merry Widow</em>&#8216;s dictionary definition as a bereaved woman who is &#8216;amorous or designing&#8217;.</p>
<p>This idea goes back to the medieval age: the Scottish William Dunbar&#8217;s brilliantly phonetic poem &#8216;The Tretis of the Tua Mariit Wemen and the Wedo&#8217; features a <em>widow</em> who sits in a field telling two married women she&#8217;s found from somewhere about the comparative excellence of her own state:</p>
<blockquote><p>With him died all my dole and my dreary thoughts;<br />
Now done is my duly night, my day is upsprungen,<br />
Adieu dolour, adieu! My dainty now begins:<br />
Now am I a widow, i-wis, and well am at ease&#8230;</p>
<p>William Dunbar, <a href="http://www.thomondgate.net/pdf/Dunbar/Dunbar_3.__Tretis_of_the_Tua_Mariit_Wemen_Glossed___subheads.pdf">The Two Married Women and the Widow</a> c.1490s</p></blockquote>
<p>Anyone familiar with Chaucer&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wife_of_Bath's_Tale">Wife of Bath</a> may recognise something of Alysoun&#8217;s archness here – unlike the other Older Woman, the <em>old maid</em>, the <em>widow </em>is a legitimately sexually experienced woman, often with a bit of money, who has, in consequence, less to lose than the young <em>maiden</em>. With this licence, the medieval <em>widow </em>is frequently presented as a bawdy sexual facilitator, and she is also free herself to run riot, cause scandals, wander around unchaperoned and facilitate other people&#8217;s sexual encounters with relative impunity.</p>

<h3>Staring at the Sea</h3>
<p>Of course, it&#8217;s not all sitting in fields and enjoying your inheritance: the <em>widow</em>&#8216;s independent fortune certainly makes her a target for gold-diggers – as is the case with every <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3FZ_jtDMVg">Margaret Dumont</a> character in every Marx Brothers film ever. There are also lots of interesting cases in literature where you know the absent husband&#8217;s in trouble because the vultures are circling round his wife – Odysseus&#8217; Penelope is for a time a <em>widow </em>in the word&#8217;s second sense: &#8216;a wife separated from (or deserted by) her husband&#8217;. In addition to this, she also has to contend with house full of Suitors drinking her out of house and home on the (misguided) assumption that Odysseus is dead, rather than simply shagging Calypso on an island far, far away.</p>
<p>Penelope&#8217;s <em>widow</em>hood also lurks at the back of the North American term <em>Widow&#8217;s Walk,</em> &#8216;a railed or balustraded platform built on the roof, originally in early New England, for providing an unimpeded view of the sea&#8217;, and a highly evocative phrase suggestive of young Scarlett O&#8217;Hara-style sea-<em>widows</em>, whose British equivalents would probably have been provided for by the financial services company <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Widows">Scottish Widows</a>, first set up in 1815 as a way to provide for <a href="http://www.afoolandhismoney.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/scottishwidows.jpg">(sexy) <em>widows</em></a>, sisters and daughters whose husbands were lost in the Napoleonic Wars.</p>
<p>The Penelopean <em>widow</em> doesn&#8217;t really exist any more, but <em>widow</em>&#8216;s second meaning has a more modern significance first spotted in Late Middle English &#8211; &#8216;a wife whose husband devotes most of his time to a specified activity and is rarely at home&#8217;. Some readers may have heard the term &#8216;<em>World Cup Widow</em>&#8216; bandied about last year – other examples the dictionary gives include &#8216;<em>golf widow</em>&#8216; (sweet jeebus, get out of that one sistah&#8230;) and &#8216;<em>business widow</em>&#8216;. There&#8217;s also the more niche example of the &#8216;Secret Society Widow&#8217; – the <a href="http://www.freemasonry.london.museum/">Museum of Freemasonry</a> in Covent Garden has a rather nice clock on display that was presented to the wife of a member &#8216;in gratitude for her allowing her husband his Lodge nights&#8217;. Here there is a sense of these women as being passive blocks on enjoyment for someone else – the World Cup <em>Widow</em> is basically me moaning about having a sudden dip in loving attentions because there are men in ridiculous shorts running around on a screen in a noisy pub&#8230; Ahem. I digress.</p>
<h3>Kiss me in the shadow of a doubt</h3>
<p>Anyway, here we reach the flip-side of the <em>Merry Widow</em>, best exemplified in Alfred Hitchcock&#8217;s personal favourite of his own films, <strong>Shadow of a Doubt </strong>(1943). This features Joseph Cotton as the &#8216;Merry Widow Murderer&#8217; with a venomous attitude towards these <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEoTXa_52A0">&#8216;horrible, faded, fat, greedy women&#8217;</a> that may be extreme, but nonetheless exemplifies the idea that a <em>widow</em>&#8216;s financial independence actually renders her &#8216;useless&#8217; and a hindrance to earthly happiness (read: money) for everyone else. On this, there&#8217;s an interesting little typographic significance of <em>widow </em>first recorded in the mid-twentieth century &#8211; she is &#8216;a short last line of a page or column considered undesirable&#8217;. That is, the <em>widow </em>represents a kind of hangover, something that is surplus to requirement, and no longer neatly slotted into a clear, neat unit.</p>

<p>As well as being targets for Hitchcockian serial killers, <em>widows </em>can also adopt this role themselves of course – the <em>black widow </em>is a criminal female whose widowhood is assumed to have been – shall we say – voluntary. This phrase originates from the <em>black widow spider</em>, a venomous North American spider, especially <em>Latrodectus mactons</em>, &#8216;the female of which usually devours its mate&#8217;. A fear of female power and often source of grim fascination, this term works rather interestingly with notable Rock Widows – <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtney_Love">Courtney Love</a>, whom many genuinely accuse of having murdered Kurt Cobain; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoko_Ono">Yoko Ono</a>, who was never really a popular fave to begin with; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priscilla_Presley">Priscilla Presley</a> and even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faith_Evans">Faith Evans</a>, widow of The Notorious B.I.G. and the brains behind a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM0-ZU8njdo">dodgy reworking of The Police</a>.</p>
<p>These inevitably take on an important role as mediator of their husbands&#8217; glory, and living blocks on libel, speculation and marketing opportunities. Courtney Love famously &#8216;released&#8217; her husband&#8217;s suicide note to Nirvana fans and Yoko Ono wasted no time in putting together a posthumous Lennon album after his murder (reportedly showing up in the studio the very next day). The<a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/03/21/an-alphabet-of-feminism-22-v-is-for-vitriol/"> vitriol </a>these women have variously attracted presumably relates to a sense of the <em>widow </em>as a figure standing between fan and artist, with a hefty inheritance and a team of lawyers. It also compares curiously with the hatred or suspicion directed at many of the Political Widows with which this post began.</p>
<p>But ultimately there are as many different types of <em>widow </em>as there are <em>widows.</em> This post has attempted not so much to categorise them as to suggest a few ways people have regarded them: Jackie O (tragically graceful); political dowager (devious and suspect); the rich survivor draped in Chanel and gullibility – and a middle-aged Scottish woman sitting in a field, really quite content with her lot.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<h6 style="text-align: center;">M</h6>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">MARRIAGE</h2>
<blockquote><p>Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife, and they shall be one flesh.</p>
<p>Genesis 2.24</p></blockquote>
<p>So begins <em>marriage. </em>In this day and age, most people think of such &#8216;cleaving&#8217; as kinda cute, an emotional commitment &#8220;&#8217;til death do us part&#8221;; and indeed the union matrimony represents (&#8216;bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh&#8217;) begins with the word&#8217;s Latin ancestor, the double-gendered <em>maritus / marita </em>(= &#8216;husband / wife&#8217;). Ever-efficient, the Romans join husband and wife in one word, giving us, in miniature, <em>marriage&#8217;s </em>first definition: &#8216;the relation between married persons; wedlock&#8217;.</p>
<h3>Ooh little darlin&#8217;&#8230;</h3>

<p>But<em> </em>before all our newfangled post-Romantic notions of individualism, <em>marriage</em> was much less dewy-eyed. It required nothing more than parental consent, and its functions were social, religious and legal. Firstly, it acknowledged a sexual relationship and those children born within it, thus easing the financial burden of bastard upkeep on society and oiling the cogs of inheritance. Secondly, it was a Holy Sacrament, an institution to prevent sin, though it did <strong>not</strong> sanction guilt-free sex – too much <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/11/29/an-alphabet-of-femininism-9-i-is-for-infant/">fun with your wife</a>, and it became <em>adultery</em> (= &#8216;pollution of the marriage bed&#8217;).</p>
<p>Finally – then as now – <em>marriage </em>linked families, dynasties, and countries together &#8216;in-law&#8217;, in a way that could be personal, symbolic, or world-changing: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P27r-DERSRo">new money</a> meeting <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/britain/exhibitions/hogarth/modernmorals/marriagealamode.shtm">impoverished aristocracy</a>; the Venetian Doge annually &#8216;marrying&#8217; the sea; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_of_Braganza">Catherine of Braganza</a> bringing England £300,000, Bombay and Tangier as her dowry. In extension, it helped negotiate the legal exchange of worldly goods, including a dower for the bride should she survive her groom, inheritance for the children, and the resolution of all money matters under the auspices of the <em>pater familias.</em> So it was impossible for a wife to run up debt, to own property, or, in any sense, to <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/11/29/an-alphabet-of-femininism-9-i-is-for-infant/">exist independently of her husband</a>. In consequence, <em>marriage </em>became the Holy Grail for 99.9% of young women, who dreaded remaining financially dependent on rich relations or married sisters should the marriage-market reject them (as it did, if you were the wrong side of one in three aristocratic women).</p>
<h3>&#8230;if U ain&#8217;t busy for the next 7 years&#8230;</h3>
<p>Phew. In its second definition <em>marriage</em> takes up the legal challenge, becoming &#8216;the action, or act, of marrying; the ceremony by which two persons are made husband and wife&#8217;.</p>

Raphael&#39;s Marriage of the Virgin.</p></div>
<p>The non-specifics here are no accident: to the irritation of the early modern church, &#8216;contract marriages&#8217; and Dodgy Marriage more generally (<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gretna_Green">Scotch Marriages</a> </em>or <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleet_Marriage">Fleet Marriages</a></em>) endured for centuries before the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_Act_1753">Marriage Act</a> of 1753 put paid to such shenanigans and demanded a public service or none at all. Previously, &#8216;the ceremony by which two persons are made husband and wife&#8217; could be an exchange of bent or halved coins, the presentation of a ring, or a declaration (&#8216;I make you my wife&#8217;). There were certain caveats to this last, of course &#8211; you had to use the present tense (no conditionals), unless you used the future and then tumbled into bed: present consummation is present consent.</p>
<p>All very neat, in theory, although such <em>marriages</em> generally took place on the hoof between impetuous couples and only became of real significance once the bride fell pregnant or one or both of the parties got into difficulties. Then you get into semantics: what does &#8216;will&#8217; mean, exactly? It&#8217;s an uncooperative word, conflating what you &#8216;want&#8217; and what you &#8216;will do&#8217;. Church courts agreed, and many of those marriages that were challenged were dissolved, with an inevitably skewed impact on the would-be wife.</p>
<p>So marriage is as much about <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/11/29/an-alphabet-of-femininism-9-i-is-for-infant/">speech and silence</a> as &#8216;cleaving&#8217;: moreover, much of its value depends on the weight society gives how you live (today, you can lose your state benefits if you &#8216;<a href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/MoneyTaxAndBenefits/BenefitsTaxCreditsAndOtherSupport/BeginnersGuideToBenefits/DG_4016267">live with another person as if you are married</a>&#8216;). It also creates interesting problems if you are physically silenced before you can assert your consent (as happens in Manzoni&#8217;s novel <strong>The Betrothed</strong>), or if your marriage is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etXMgEJPZRA">explosively interrupted</a>, as in Fassbinder&#8217;s film <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Marriage_of_Maria_Braun">The Marriage of Maria Braun</a></strong>. Conversely, Renaissance actors wondered what God thought about marriages carried out on stage as part of a performance: valid or not? Why not? This whole idea is, in essence, the premise of Tim Burton&#8217;s <strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p_afU59YMQ">The Corpse Bride</a> </strong>(2004), where nobody questions the legality of Victor&#8217;s (clearly accidental) declaration to the bride of the title, despite trying every other conceivable method to get him out of it.</p>
<h3>&#8230;Let&#8217;s pretend we&#8217;re married and go all night.</h3>
<p>The word <em>marriage </em>reflects this in a now-obsolete sense, as &#8216;intimate union&#8217;, antonymic to<em> virginity</em>. And here I nearly tripped up on another little tradition: breach of promise, a common law tort allowing a partner to sue their long-fled lover for damages based on the impact of such &#8216;intimate union&#8217; but also on the value of language – &#8216;Does she know how you told me you&#8217;d hold me until you die? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPcyTyilmYY">Well you&#8217;re still alive</a>&#8230;&#8217;</p>
<p>This tort was overwhelmingly used by women, although originally payable to the father of a seduced girl, who had lost &#8216;services&#8217; (make me a cuppa, love) because of her pregnancy. Later on, it became a means of quantifying waste of time, reputation and trousseau-money in a marriage market competitive enough that such things mattered. Although the tort was abolished in the UK in 1970, a version is still in use elsewhere: a jilted woman in Chicago is currently <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/jilted-bride-sues-groom-95000/story?id=12403921">suing her fiance</a> for the costs of her cancelled wedding, and &#8217;emotional distress&#8217;. Whether or not she will succeed is unclear, but her early-modern precursors inevitably triumphed:</p>
<blockquote><p>See my interesting client<br />
Victim of a heartless wile!<br />
See the traitor all defiant ,<br />
Wears a supercilious smile!<br />
Sweetly smiled my client on him<br />
Coyly wooed and gently won him&#8230;.</p>
<p>W.S. Gilbert, <a href="http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/trial/libretto.txt">Trial By Jury</a> (1875)</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Trial By Jury </strong>explains why the tort was so useful to jilted women, but also why it declined: by 1875 female financial options were expanding enough to change the public perception of such cases from &#8216;poor innocent maid vs. base seducer&#8217; to &#8216;I ain&#8217;t sayin&#8217; she&#8217;s a gold digger&#8230;&#8217; So what began as a way to compensate gender inequality itself ended as a vehicle for misogyny, with stories of pretty girls luring men in and then threatening to do the legal equivalent of &#8216;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_William">thcreaming and thcreaming until i&#8217;m thick</a>&#8216;. What God has joined, let no man put asunder.</p>
