										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thank you to everyone who came to our party, and who reads, enjoys, and interacts with our site. It&#8217;s been a great year and we are dead pleased to have met so many great people.</p>
<p>Our party was a blast. Most of all, we were glad to see such a mix of genders there. (In the first half hour the bartender commented, with obvious interest, that there were &#8220;kind of a lot of <em>dudes</em> for a feminist party&#8221;. Then our Steve walked in wearing a badge which read <em>I WROTE THE ONE ABOUT JU-JITSU OLD LADIES</em><sup><a href="/2011/10/11/ta-very-much-from-badrep-towers/#footnote_0_7734" id="identifier_0_7734" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" Here, if you were bemused by that reference. ">1</a></sup>. I&#8217;m not sure what the bartender thought by the time we put the Lady Gaga/Ghostbusters mashup on the stereo, but he looked, at the very least, intrigued, so I call victory.) </p>
