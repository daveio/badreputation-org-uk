					<description><![CDATA[Who else is into tabletop roleplaying and sick of all the whitewashing and chainmail bikinis?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li><em><strong>Rabalias</strong> of RPG-gaming blogging collective <a href="http://blackarmada.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Black Armada</strong></a> sent us this post, together with a petition. And if <strong>you</strong> have a guest post brewing in your brain, you know the drill: <a href="mailto:badrepeditors@gmail.com?subject=pitch">email us on badrepeditors@gmail.com</a>.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dungeons and Dragons (D&amp;D)</strong> is the single most famous roleplaying game in the world, the route most people got into roleplaying, and the flagship of the hobby. So it&#8217;s a tragedy that the game is pushing away potential fans through artwork and even game text that is overwhelmingly focused on one customer demographic: white men.</p>
<div id="attachment_12997" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/?attachment_id=12997" rel="attachment wp-att-12997"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12997" data-attachment-id="12997" data-permalink="/2013/01/08/guest-post-dd-and-who-its-packaged-for/dice/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/dice.jpg?fit=500%2C333&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="500,333" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="dice" data-image-description="&lt;p&gt;Not everybody who enjoys the use of these is a straight cis white dude.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>That’s a pretty provocative statement, right there. But I’m confident in making it, because the evidence is there for anyone who wants to see it. You could start by flipping open a copy of pretty much any D&amp;D book and looking through the artwork. See how many women and people of colour you can find – and then see how many of them are half-dressed or made to look weak or submissive.</p>
<p>Actually, you don’t need to, because someone already did it for you. Anna Kreider <a href="http://www.pelgranepress.com/?p=3501" target="_blank">reviewed the artwork in the D&amp;D 4th edition</a> books (specifically the <strong>Dungeon Master’s Guide</strong>, <strong>Players Handbook</strong>, <strong>Players Handbook 2</strong> and the <strong>Adventurer’s Vault</strong>) and rated the images therein.</p>
<p>Kreider’s findings were striking – of the 40% or so of humans (and demi-humans) that were depicted as female, well over a third hit each of the measures she chose (being half-dressed or posed in a sexually suggestive way, for instance). Needless to say, the remaining 60% of images, the ones which were of men, tended to be wearing more clothes, in more active, non-sexual poses.</p>
<p>It gets better, because Chris Van Dyke <a href="http://raceindnd.wordpress.com/2008/11/18/nerd-nite-presentation-november-18th-2008/" target="_blank">had a look at D&amp;D from the perspective of race</a>. He was able to find only two examples of a non-white character in the core books of all four numbered editions of D&amp;D. That means non-white folks are practically invisible in D&amp;D.</p>
<p>Now, these findings are based on subjective judgements. That’s unavoidable, because things like “sexually suggestive” and “white” can often only be judged subjectively in artwork. You can go and judge for yourself if you doubt their conclusions. But I think if we’re honest, these results only confirm what most of us already knew from experience.</p>
<p>It isn’t the end of the world. I’ve enjoyed lots of pop culture replete with sexism. And after all, it’s only a fantasy! But then again, shouldn’t our fantasy worlds contain a richer variety of creatures than real life? And what does it say to potential new gamers if they can’t find a picture of someone like them anywhere in these books? Is D&amp;D really just a game about white dudes slugging it out in a dungeon somewhere? I don’t think so.</p>
<p>OK, so what to do about it? I love roleplaying, and despite years of moaning about the mechanics, I still love D&amp;D. The fact that it’s not exactly a beacon of gender and racial equality is, for me, an obstacle to be overcome rather than a sign I should give up on the game altogether.</p>
<p>It so happens that <a href="http://www.wizards.com" target="_blank">Wizards of the Coast</a> are writing a new edition of D&amp;D right now. That’s why I put together <a href="http://www.thepetitionsite.com/522/618/587/dd-should-be-for-everyone-not-just-white-men/" target="_blank">a petition calling on them to do better</a>.</p>
<p>If you’ve read this far, maybe you agree with me – and if so, it would be great if you went and <a href="http://www.thepetitionsite.com/522/618/587/dd-should-be-for-everyone-not-just-white-men/" target="_blank">signed it</a>, and better yet share it with your friends and encourage them to sign too.</p>
<p>The petition won’t change anything in itself. Wizards of the Coast could ignore it, and maybe they will. But if they can see that there are hundreds of gamers out there who want more than whitewash and chainmail bikinis, maybe they’ll respond. We owe it to the hobby to give them a clear message.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>It&#8217;s a guest post! <strong>Rai </strong>got in touch with us <a href="http://twitter.com/BadRepUK">on <strong>Twitter</strong></a> to see if they could do anything about our lack of posts on gaming (apart from Markgraf&#8217;s brow-furrowing <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/01/19/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-the-frank-miller-effect-strikes-again/">loving critiques</a> <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/02/08/assassins-creed-postscript-and-haystack-challenge/">of <strong>Assassin&#8217;s Creed</strong></a>, natch). &#8220;Welcome aboard!&#8221; we said. Here&#8217;s the first of what&#8217;ll hopefully be a series of entries in BadRep&#8217;s Gamer Diary.</em></p>
<p>March saw the eagerly anticipated release of <strong>Dragon Age II</strong>; the follow-up to <strong>Dragon Age: Origins</strong> and <strong>Awakening</strong> (along with all the extra DLC that became available during the interim period).  <strong>Dragon Age</strong>, for those of you unfamiliar with the games, is a fantasy RPG in which you guide your character through quests and the main plotline, battling all manner of nasty creatures and unscrupulous types along the way.  You gather a team made up of mages, warriors and rogues who may be human, elf or dwarf, and they help you defeat the forces of evil.</p>
<p>One of the key features of games like this is that you can build your own character: you pick the gender, the hair style, the facial features, the class (e.g. a mage), and in some instances you can even pick the voice.  I, for example, have a male warrior elf with ginger hair in <strong>Origins</strong> and in <strong>Dragon Age II </strong>my character Zakarianna Hawke is a female, white-haired rogue with a facial tattoo (you can see a visual of her below left).  The possibilities aren’t quite endless, but they’re still fairly comprehensive.</p>

I was, however, quite late to the <strong>Mass Effect</strong> party for one very key reason: I thought you <strong>had</strong> to be male.  That is to say, the advertising and marketing for <strong>Mass Effect </strong>gave me no inkling that there was any other option than to be the character that features in the trailers and the stills.</p>
<p>Normally this doesn’t bother me (pretty much all the games I have ever played have a male protagonist) but I read an unfortunate article that suggested Commander Shepard – <strong>Mass Effect</strong>’s protagonist – was a bit of a womaniser.  So I wrote it off.</p>
<p>I then, much later, got a little overexcited by all the sales after Christmas in which I saw <strong>Mass Effect 1</strong> and <strong>2</strong> for a little over a tenner.  I asked my brother what he thought of them and ended up buying the games – turns out, you can play as a female character!  Plus all the womanising depends entirely on the decisions made in-game by the person directing the character (again, my take on Commander Shepard, Drakhoa Shepard, is just below left further down). </p>
<p>This little surprise, combined with <strong>Dragon Age II</strong>’s recent advertising prior to its release, made me wonder why games that allow you to play as male or female are only ever marketed using the preset male appearance. For illustration purposes I have collected a few trailers courtesy of YouTube:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlACgYHtWCI"><strong>Dragon Age II</strong> “Destiny – Extended” Trailer </a></li>
<li> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8mn1rVakZg"> <strong>Dragon Age II</strong> “Rise to Power” Trailer</a></li>
<li> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnEej1RfqTs"> Mass Effect 3 “Debut” Trailer</a></li>
<li> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLhptv1yYMU"><strong> Mass Effect 2</strong> “Full Cinematic&#8221; Trailer</a></li>
<li> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx9sPQpjgjU"> <strong>Mass Effect 2</strong> “Launch” Trailer</a></li>
<li> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVzJZCVVV4"> <strong>Fable II</strong></a></li>
<li> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJnT3u01k18"><strong> Fable III</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>From those trailers alone, would you have any idea that you can actually play through as a female protagonist?  If you knew nothing else about these games, I doubt there’s any chance you’d be able to guess the female protagonist option from the advertising.  This could be quite off-putting to gamers (not just female gamers either) as the advertising doesn’t highlight the option of choice that you get in the game; <em>to be a character that you want to be.</em>  It certainly put me off: when confronted with the limited information and the possibility that the male protagonist was a character I wouldn’t be able to stand, I chose to look elsewhere.  Even though, for me, that elsewhere was probably going back to a First Person Shooter with a male protagonist: at least most of them don’t talk, and you forget the character when you’re facing down hundreds of Replica soldiers or when a Necromorph just came bursting out of an air vent to tear you to pieces.</p>

I’m sure there is some (weak) reasoning to do with demographic statistics and some blanket statements about who buys these games, but surely that’s wearing a little thin by now?  I certainly got sick of seeing the preset male character’s smug face in all the<strong> Dragon Age II</strong> trailers.</p>
<p>Well, if we look over at <strong>Blizzard</strong> and some of their teasers for <strong>Diablo III</strong> (coming out later this year) then there are some positive developments on the horizon.  They’ve begun releasing trailers relating to each ‘class’ of character for the upcoming game &#8211; all of which can be played as a male or female version – and, most importantly, they’re telling us all about it in their advertising!</p>
<ul>
<li> <a href=“http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WByqPqwBrzs"> <strong>Diablo III</strong> Demon Hunter</a></li>
<li> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6Afs-K40DA"> <strong>Diablo III </strong>Wizard</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Demon Hunter and Wizard are two of the classes you will be able to play as in <strong>Diablo III</strong>; the others are Monk, Barbarian, and Witch Doctor.  The latter three are automatically presented as male, but Demon Hunter and Wizard are automatically presented to us as female on Blizzard’s website for <strong>Diablo III</strong>, despite the fact all five classes can be played as either.  It is interesting as well that at BlizzCon2010 the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrUr4I7zkew">19 minutes of gameplay footage</a> included in the press kit featured both the female Demon Hunter and Wizard as the protagonist.</p>
<p>Clearly, then, not all RPG gaming advertising is male-centric, and hopefully more companies will start to follow down the path that Blizzard is taking – showing the audience the variety that is available in-game, instead of just marketing it at male gamers and assuming female gamers <em>(should such a fabled beast exist – haha!)</em> aren&#8217;t going to get offended at being ignored or forgotten about.</p>
<p>They are, as I mentioned earlier, all good games (<strong>Fable</strong>, <strong>Dragon Age</strong>, <strong>Mass Effect</strong>) so don’t let the advertising put you off playing them, but equally let’s not resign ourselves to the notion that male-centric advertising will never change.  It is changing; it just happens to be very slowly.</p>
