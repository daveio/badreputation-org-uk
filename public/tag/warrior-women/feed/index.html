										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>RIVETING NEWS: BadRep Towers is changing its ISP! This means the internet connection may be a bit ropey for the editor! So we&#8217;re hoping to have a post a day like we normally do, but hold on to your hats if we don&#8217;t quite hit our schedule this week. On to the links!</p>
<ul>
<li>A few weeks ago, but for anyone who&#8217;s not seen it: The <strong>New York Times</strong> features <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/31/business/media/31link.html?_r=2&amp;smid=tw-nytimes">an article on the gender disparity in wikipedia editors</a>.</li>
<li>Linked to by commenter Ian on <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/01/20/five-pirate-women-from-the-pages-of-history-number-one-lady-killigrew/">our first Pirate Women of History post</a>, <a href="http://www.lothene.org/others/women.html">this page is from a reenactment site, but <strong>basically quite a good pile of historical info, links and lists about women in martial leadership through history</strong></a>. Also relevant for anyone unpersuaded by the arguments in the recent <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/01/19/assassins-creed-the-frank-miller-effect-strikes-again/">Assassin&#8217;s Creed debate</a> about Activities An Independently-Minded Female Character Can Be Doing In A Period Setting Apart From Sex Work (Which Is Fine, But Not The Only Available Activity For A Scriptwriter). And WHERE IS THE NEXT PIRATE POST, I hear you cry? PANIC NOT, DEAR READERS. It&#8217;s in the works.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s <strong>Women in Horror Recognition Month</strong>, if you didn&#8217;t know.  Stuck to name many women authors and directors working in the horror genre that aren&#8217;t male?  It&#8217;s not for lack of women, that&#8217;s for sure, and you can discover many of them at Melissa Helwig&#8217;s <a href="http://littlemisszombie.blogspot.com/">Little Miss Zombie blog</a>, <a href="http://splinister.com/post/bloody-women">Maura McHugh&#8217;s blog on Splinister.com</a>, and Re/Action magazine editor <a href="http://sarahdobbs.wordpress.com/">Sarah Dobb&#8217;s blog</a>.</li>
<li>And while BadRep struggles through a storm of BT Line Rental Negotiations to hold on to its Internet Connection Hat, <a href="http://reactionblog.tumblr.com/buy_now">why not order your copy of <strong>Re/Action magazine</strong>, issue 2</a> (check out the rockin&#8217; cover). We&#8217;ve stocked up on our reading materials for the internet drought; drought or no drought you should check it out anyway. Good stuff.</li>
<li><strong>Salon</strong> sums it up: <a href="http://www.salon.com/entertainment/tv/feature/2011/02/15/lara_logan_rape_reaction">What Not To Say About Lara Logan.</a> <em>(Discusses sexual assault.)</em></li>
<li>Meanwhile,<strong> Eulogy</strong> magazine <a href="http://www.eulogymagazine.co.uk/article/ofinterest/detail/id/89">are covering LGBT History Month</a> &#8211; from the point of view of a magazine themed around death, but good to see it on there.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.emcarroll.com/comics/anu/page01.html" target="_blank"><strong>Em Carroll</strong> has drawn a short, beautiful comic for Valentine&#8217;s season</a>.</li>
<li>Do you play computer games? Then hopefully some of the refrains on  <a href="http://fatuglyorslutty.com/"><strong>Fat, Ugly or Slutty</strong></a> won&#8217;t have happened to you! They say: <em>Some players like to send creepy, disturbing, insulting, degrading  and/or just plain rude messages to other online players, usually women. We think this is funny.</em> Could be triggering for some, but it&#8217;s a nice demonstration of solidarity. And here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.fragdolls.com/index.php/blogs/detail/category/rhoulette/a_picture_is_worth_a_thousand_shouted_words">an article about the creation of the site</a>.</li>
</ul>
