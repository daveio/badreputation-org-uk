										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a talk by Bruce Feiler, linked from the rather excellent <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks">TED talks</a> which I listen to every now and then. Dads and their connection with feminism<a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/10/06/fathers-4-feminism/"> is something of a hot topic for me</a>, and this particularly resonated, because it concerns a man, diagnosed with cancer, planning to assemble a Council of Dads to give support and wisdom to his daughters should he die.</p>

<p>I was taken by his concept of dadhood, and his understanding and appreciation for the importance of it. He takes a tandem approach, both looking to replace the aspects of himself as a person and looking for people whose responses to &#8220;what advice would you give my daughters&#8221; he liked. The end results are surprisingly non-gender stereotyped &#8211; get over obstacles, jump in mud puddles, find a friend.</p>
<p>He also talks a lot about the importance of community in creating a whole person, and a little about the idea of a &#8220;modern man&#8221; as actively seeking a role in their child&#8217;s upbringing, which is very encouraging.</p>
