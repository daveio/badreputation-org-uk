					<description><![CDATA[Let's be honest, Star Trek has had some bad press over the years. Its gender politics were sometimes a bit wonky. But here's why it's my first love.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you asked me what my favourite TV show was, I could pick any number of shows at this point. I&#8217;m a bit of a small screen geek, and I collect shows (and their associated fandoms) almost as quickly as I lose interest in them once I&#8217;ve milked them of all the interesting bits. But only a few shows have stood the test of time, and one of them is my first love. I bet it&#8217;s your first love, too. In fact, it&#8217;s the first love of so many people that there&#8217;s a whole name for people like me: <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trekkie">Trekkie</a></em>.</p>
<h3>Wobbly Utopia</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s be honest, <strong>Star Trek</strong> has had some bad press over the years. Its gender politics were sometimes a bit wonky. Its racial politics also wobbled a bit. Its view of homosexuality was that it didn&#8217;t exist, and if it did, only aliens were gay (and if they were hot, semi-naked female aliens, so much the better). Most people in the Western world have seen at least one episode of the original series, and if they saw it at any point other than the &#8217;60s, they may have formed some negative views. There were probably Forehead Aliens involved, and the sets probably wobbled a bit. Captain Kirk spoke&#8230; with many&#8230; pauses&#8230; and&#8230; gestures. Spock raised an eyebrow. McCoy said, &#8220;He&#8217;s dead, Jim,&#8221; and at least one redshirt died to prove it was serious. And maybe it was interesting at the time, and had some interesting ideas, but then ten million spin-offs followed, and then there was a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0796366/">film</a>, and Zoe Saldana ran around in a miniskirt while Chris Pine fought Zachary Quinto in an erotically-charged episode of fisticuffs on the bridge.</p>
<p>This is all true, and the less said about the debacle of <strong>Enterprise,</strong> the better. But the thing is, none of this detracts from the achievements of the original series. I&#8217;ll start with this cast photo&#8230;</p>
<div id="attachment_6148" style="width: 262px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/tos_002.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6148" data-attachment-id="6148" data-permalink="/2011/11/07/my-first-love-star-trek/tos_002/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/tos_002.jpg?fit=590%2C700&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="590,700" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Original Trek, second season cast.

Image (c) Paramount</p></div>
<p>You&#8217;ll notice several things immediately:</p>
<p>1) everyone is wearing implausible outfits and has magical levitating hair;</p>
<p>2) the women are in miniskirts; and</p>
<p>3) the Russian guy is <em>definitely</em> wearing a wig.</p>
<p>But look a bit closer. This is a second season cast photo, so that places it in 1967/8, in a show marketed as<em> &#8220;Wagon Train to the Stars&#8221;</em>. There are people of different ethnicities and backgrounds, and there are also two women. Neither are secretaries.</p>
<p>I could talk at length about what <strong>Star Trek</strong> has done in promoting a vision of a multicultural, utopian future. The crew included a Russian crewmember at a time when the Cold War was going strong; it included a Japanese crewmember not so very long after WWII and not in a chop socky or waiter role. It featured the first interracial kiss on American television, when Kirk and Uhura are forced to embrace in the otherwise execrable episode, <em>Plato&#8217;s Stepchildren. </em>(In fact, the actors ensured that the actual kiss, rather than a simulated one, was shown, by pulling faces in all subsequent retakes.) The Federation itself is a multicultural utopia, where member nations hate each other and violently disagree on everything, and yet will work together for the common good just the same.</p>
<h3>Living in the Future</h3>
<p>I could focus instead on the technological impact. I could talk about classic <strong>Trek</strong> &#8216;inventing&#8217; a cornucopia of <a href="http://roadtickle.com/things-we-have-now-that-star-trek-invented/">future tech</a>, from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Cooper_(inventor)">mobile</a> <a href="http://www.inventor-strategies.com/cell-phone-invention.html">phones</a> to <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/3349667/Star-Trek-warp-drive-is-a-possibility-say-scientists.html">warp</a> <a href="http://news.discovery.com/space/roddenberrys-star-trek-inspires-generations-110908.html">drive</a> to <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/breakthrough-brings-star-trek-teleport-a-step-closer-451673.html">transporters</a>. Sure, warp drive remains an impossibility, and thus far transporters have only managed to send bits of plastic from one transporter to another, more akin to <strong>The Prestige</strong> than true teleportation, but how many people were thinking about it at all before <strong>Trek</strong> dreamed it up? Someone always has to dream up the idea before it can be invented. Sure, <strong>Trek</strong> only invented their Feinbergers because they didn&#8217;t have enough money and had to make do from scrounging through the waste bins of other shows, but that&#8217;s the beauty of it. Other people&#8217;s rubbish &#8211; when painted purple and hung on the wall &#8211; was enough to inspire people. Now<em> that&#8217;s</em> impressive.</p>
<h3>Fandom</h3>
<p>Or I could discuss the creation of slash fiction, of how it came about in the 1970s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_fiction">in response </a>to the <a href="http://slashphilosophy.livejournal.com/21477.html">cancellation</a> of <strong>Trek</strong>. Of how fans &#8211; primarily female and in their 20s and 30s &#8211; loved the characters and missed them so much that they got together and wrote stories for them. Many of them got published and ended up on the New York Times bestseller list &#8211; AC Crispin&#8217;s <strong>Yesterday&#8217;s Son</strong> was a fanzine before it was a book, for instance. I could talk about how they took the names Kirk and Spock and made them into Kirk/Spock, the slash in the middle indicating a homoerotic relationship. I&#8217;ve read the early slash efforts, and frankly, they&#8217;re not terribly good: it&#8217;s primarily people writing about sex they&#8217;re not having, in plots that aren&#8217;t convincing, with art that is a bit lacking. But the thing is, it&#8217;s astonishing that those early fanzines existed at all, that communities sprung up with such fervour and dedication to focus on one little show, long-cancelled. These days, &#8216;slash&#8217; means an m/m story, irrespective of fandom. Many young fans have no idea of the origin of the term and, influenced in equal measure by anime yaoi naming conventions, will mark the pairing with an x (eg. KirkxSpock), yet still refer to the relationship as &#8216;slash&#8217;. The name endures.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not all that <strong>Trek</strong> decided online. When the internet started up, the <strong>Trek</strong> groups had a tricky problem: both classic and <strong>TNG</strong>&#8216;s main characters shared letters. This was a disaster at a time when Usenet was the main source of contact, and subject lines were limited to a small number of characters. Naming and pairing conventions quickly sprang up, with the order of the letters indicating the pairing. American film rating systems were brought into use. <em>[FIC] TOS: New Dawn, K/S</em>,<em> Mc, NC-17 (1/1)</em> was instantly decipherable as a post title. <strong>Trek</strong> fandom has had a massive impact on fandom in general, its conventions and rules seeping through a multitude of others.</p>
<h3>Making History</h3>
<p>Then there are the people that Trek has influenced. How about <strong>Rev. Martin Luther King</strong>, for example? In a candid conversation with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nichelle_Nichols">Nichelle</a> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0629667/bio">Nichols</a>, he expressed his admiration for her work as Uhura, and <a href="http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-01-17/entertainment/27087605_1_lieutenant-uhura-nichols-today-gene-roddenberry">urged her to remain on the show</a> at a time when she was <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2011/01/17/star-treks-nichelle-nichols-on-how-martin-luther-king-king-jr-changed-her-life/">considering quitting</a>. Or maybe <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/08/02/unsung-heroes-mae-jemison/"><strong>Dr Mae Jamison</strong></a>, the first African American woman in space. She, too, <a href="http://www.spacestationinfo.com/female-astronauts-24-Mae%20Jemison.html">watched the show as a child </a>and was<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/dept/news/stanfordtoday/ed/9607/pdf/ST9607mjemison.pdf"> inspired by the example </a>that Nichelle Nichols&#8217; Uhura set.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll protect you, fair maiden.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry, neither!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8211; Sulu tries to &#8216;rescue&#8217; Uhura, but she&#8217;s having none of it in the first season episode, <strong>The Naked Time</strong>.</p></blockquote>

<p>How can you NOT love a show that gives you this much awesomeness?</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; I hear you cry, &#8220;but you&#8217;ve only talked about the <em>impact</em> of the show, not the show itself! I distinctly recall some dodgy gender politics at work&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<h3>A Handy Viewing Guide for the New Recruit</h3>
<p>Yes. OK, I admit it. <strong>Star Trek</strong>, like many shows at the time, had its writing farmed out to a pool of writers that took story outlines and turned them into scripts. Maybe they knew and loved the show and its characters, maybe they didn&#8217;t know them from Adam. Sometimes you had Harlan Ellison delivering <em>City on the Edge of Forever</em>, and sometimes you had Arthur Heinemann&#8217;s <em>The Way to Eden</em>, where space hippies sing songs and the viewer writhes in agony. So what? No show out there can claim to have 100% hit rate, and when <strong>Trek</strong> got it right, they <em>really</em> got it right. So here are a few episodes to check out, mostly from Season 1, but a couple from the later seasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Where No Man Has Gone Before</em>: where two members of the crew develop god-like powers and the inevitable happens. There is gratuitous eye-candy, in the shape of Kirk&#8217;s bared chest. Meanwhile the lead female character is dressed in exactly the same uniform as everyone else, down to the ridiculous bell-bottoms. She&#8217;s the ship&#8217;s psychiatrist, and ends up saving the day&#8230; sort of.</li>
<li><em><a href="http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Charlie_X_(episode)">Charlie X</a></em>: where a young boy with god-like powers&#8230; yes, OK. But this is a creepy, scary little episode, with eye candy provided by the semi-naked Kirk wrestling for no apparent reason. More disturbing is Charlie&#8217;s attempted rape of a crewwoman, his reactions coarse and demanding and selfish, and hers grown-up and mature. He may be the one using violence, but she never once relinquishes her control.</li>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;There&#8217;s no right way to hit a woman.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>&#8211; James Kirk to Charlie X, after the latter slaps Yeoman Rand&#8217;s bottom, <strong>Charlie X</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<li><em>The Menagerie</em>: where the original pilot is reworked. <strong>Trek</strong> does loyalty, captivity, mind-control and extreme measures.</li>
<li><strong>Balance of Terror</strong>: the Cold War episode, where Kirk informs a crewmember that bigotry has no place on his bridge.</li>
<li><strong>Devil in the Dark</strong>: where the crew learn not to make assumptions about appearances.</li>
<li><strong>City on the Edge of Forever</strong>: where Harlan Ellison <a href="http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/The_City_on_the_Edge_of_Forever_(episode)">disavows all knowledge </a>of this rather excellent episode. Kirk, Spock and McCoy end up in 1930s Earth, where Kirk meets Joan Collins, a peace activist who runs a homeless shelter. She&#8217;s strong and independent and a visionary, and is unmistakably the love of his life. (Therefore, according to the requirements of drama, she must die.)</li>
<li><strong>Mirror Mirror</strong>: Where Uhura wears an even more revealing uniform, and evil!Spock mind-invades McCoy.
<li><strong>The Enterprise Incident</strong>: where the opposing Romulan commander is female, and is tricked in the expected way. What isn&#8217;t expected is her dignity throughout. Kirk and Spock treat her throughout as their equal.</li>
<li><strong>Is There In Truth No Beauty?</strong>: Where <strong>Trek</strong> had a blind character, and had her as the lead guest character for the episode.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Turnabout_Intruder_(episode)">Turnabout Intruder</a></strong>: where Kirk and an old flame &#8211; who has a grudge &#8211; trade bodies. This episode, for all its flaws, is <em>fascinating</em>. Janice Lester was a contemporary of Kirk&#8217;s, and they were briefly involved. However, she never got command, something she attributed to her gender. In <strong>Trek</strong>-world, she has no argument: her gender is irrelevant. In 1960s America, this is something so obvious that it was rarely mentioned: <em>of course</em> her gender stopped her from getting command, no woman could possibly be a military commander! Lester&#8217;s fury is so intently realised that you can&#8217;t help feeling sorry for her, for all her insanity&#8230; and rooting for her, just a little.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Your world of starship captains doesn&#8217;t admit women.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8211; Janice Lester, <strong>Turnabout Intruder</strong></p></blockquote>

I&#8217;ve talked at length about classic <strong>Trek</strong>, and I still don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve explained why I love it so much. Maybe there isn&#8217;t a reason. Maybe I just saw it at the right time, with the right mindset. I&#8217;d just arrived in the UK, and English was a struggle. I didn&#8217;t really understand what was going on, and I don&#8217;t think I understood that Spock was an alien. But what I definitely understood that Uhura and Chapel and Rand and Number One &#8211; they were women, and they were astronauts. Having grown up on a diet of <strong>Valentina Tereshkova</strong>, it was natural to add them to my list of space-going women. And with so many women setting an example, how could I NOT want to be an astronaut myself?</p>
<p>So, there it is: my deepest, darkest secret. I studied maths and music as a child because of <strong>Trek</strong>. I got into fandom because of <strong>Trek</strong>, trying to navigate newsgroups in a cybercafe at age 13 when an Amstrad was the height of luxury. I have the DVDs, and a few of the books, and many of the friends. And above it all, when people ask what I want to do when I grow up, my immediate, unspoken reaction is, &#8220;I want to be an astronaut.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tell me that&#8217;s a bad thing.</p>
