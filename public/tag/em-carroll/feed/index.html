<p>She&#8217;s pretty well known, but deserves a mention anyway. I love the glimpse into (predominantly female) costume history I get from <strong><a href="http://drawthisdress.tumblr.com/">Draw This Dress</a></strong> &#8211; a shared project with award-winning fellow illustrator <a href="http://verabee.com/"><strong>Vera Brosgol</strong></a>. Her Valentine&#8217;s day comic last year, <a href="http://www.emcarroll.com/comics/anu/page01.html"><strong>Anu-Anulan and Yir&#8217;s Daughter</strong></a>, featured a lovely romance between two women (well, one&#8217;s a goddess, but anyway). Folklore-influenced <a href="http://emcarroll.com/comics/haresbride.html"><strong>The Hare&#8217;s Bride</strong></a> has a beautiful Carteresque simplicity to it. I love her work, and you should too.</p>

<p>I mentioned Sarah in the last post &#8211; working as colourist, she&#8217;s one third of <strong><a href="http://thepeckhaminvalids.com/">The Peckham Invalids</a></strong> team along with <a href="http://howardhardiman.com/">Howard Hardiman</a> and <a href="http://juliascheeleartblog.tumblr.com/">Julia Scheele</a>. Her blog is a great read and her art is beautiful. The above wonderfully snooty lady is her own take on one of the characters from the comic.  She says: <em>&#8220;I&#8217;d like 2012 to be a year where I stop hiding all my personal/story work in my head, notebooks and sketchbooks and get it out onto&#8230; the internet&#8221;</em>. That really struck a chord with me, because my own situation is very similar.<sup><a href="/2012/02/14/another-illustration-interlude/#footnote_0_9710" id="identifier_0_9710" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" I&rsquo;ll get around to talking about the team and what we&rsquo;ve been drawing at some point. I want to talk about these awesome people first, but if you&rsquo;re curious, trumpet-blowing will happen. I&rsquo;m, er, shy. ">1</a></sup> So I wanted to cheer Sarah on. Hope that&#8217;s not too weird. Uh. Yeah! Go Sarah, from a total stranger! And now, dear reader, you must go and Do Similarly.</p>

<h3>Patrice Aggs</h3>

<p>Thought I&#8217;d go a bit more longstanding &#8211; Patrice is pretty established, but she is also awesome, so if you aren&#8217;t familiar, here she is. Her work is soft-edged and has a kind of instant, gentle appeal &#8211; she&#8217;s done a lot of popular children&#8217;s books and resources for schools, but has a lifelong passion for comics. She&#8217;s worked with Philip Pullman and <strong>Horrible Histories</strong> and on <strong>The Snowman</strong> (CHILDHOOD NOSTALGIA WIBBLY ALERT) and has signed up to draw a story for new children&#8217;s weekly comic <a href="http://www.thephoenixcomic.co.uk/blog/what-is-the-phoenix-comic/"><strong>The Phoenix</strong></a>. Hurrah for getting children into comics! (TANGENT: Check out <a href="http://www.thephoenixcomic.co.uk/blog/strips/pirates-of-pangaea/">this sword-wielding art</a> for one of the other stories. I&#8217;d have loved that as a kid. I hope the story&#8217;s as good as Neill Cameron&#8217;s art makes it look.) The other reason I want her on this post is she&#8217;s <a href="http://www.ladiesmakingcomics.com/post/17380073166/blackhistorymonth-profile-friday-patrice-aggs-is">apparently quoted here</a><sup><a href="/2012/02/14/another-illustration-interlude/#footnote_1_9710" id="identifier_1_9710" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" At least, I think this is a quote? I wasn&rsquo;t completely clear, if I&rsquo;m honest. But it&rsquo;s great advice, either from her, or inspired by her work. So there you go. ">2</a></sup> over on <a href="http://www.ladiesmakingcomics.com/">Ladies Making Comics</a> as follows: <em>&#8220;Do-it-yourself is far duller than do-it-together. We need to champion each other. Drag the male-dominated blinkered attitude into the dustbin.&#8221;</em> </p>
<p>Wise words indeed.</p>

<h3>Marc Ellerby</h3>

<em>&#8220;Chloe Noonan is a monster hunter, but she doesn&#8217;t have any powers. She can&#8217;t beat up bad guys, she can&#8217;t run without getting a stitch. She&#8217;s kinda flakey and really not bothered about saving the world. Plus she has to get the bus everywhere. I know, right?!&#8221;</em></p>
<p>I love Marc Ellerby&#8217;s clean lines and eye for detail. His monsters are bloody excellent &#8211; you can feel how much fun he&#8217;s had dreaming them up. Also, no one draws an <em>unimpressed glare</em> (a favoured expression of mine, naturally, as a Strident Feminist Blog Editor) quite like him. So of course, I&#8217;m now madly in love with <strong>Chloe Noonan</strong>, his wonderfully indignant teen monster hunter heroine. She&#8217;s amazing. She hurls bombs at monsters and plays in a band whilst loudly cursing both vocations and her schoool-friend sidekick is pretty cool too (also, female: BOOM BOOM BECHDEL BUST). Check her out. Buy the comics. DO IT NOW. That is all.</p>

</ul>
<p>You know, I <em>still</em> don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m done. There is so much visual awesome out there. There&#8217;s a huge stream of female creators and artists and a rich seam of great heroines, characters, and attempts at inclusive projects out there. They need shouting about as much as possible. While we&#8217;re here, though not all my choices on this list are female creators, the women who work in comics, for example (and I know I&#8217;ve I&#8217;ve not really differentiated &#8216;illustration&#8217; from &#8216;comics&#8217; here, but anyway) give the lie to defensive statements <a href="http://splinister.com/post/kapow-ignores-women-again">on why women are so frequently left off panels at events</a>, and so on. They&#8217;re around. You just have to look around you.</p>
<p>For further inspiration for the budding artists out there, I leave you with this photo of Patrice Aggs in action.<sup><a href="/2012/02/14/another-illustration-interlude/#footnote_2_9710" id="identifier_2_9710" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" If you took it, I hope you do not mind.

<li>Linked to by commenter Ian on <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/01/20/five-pirate-women-from-the-pages-of-history-number-one-lady-killigrew/">our first Pirate Women of History post</a>, <a href="http://www.lothene.org/others/women.html">this page is from a reenactment site, but <strong>basically quite a good pile of historical info, links and lists about women in martial leadership through history</strong></a>. Also relevant for anyone unpersuaded by the arguments in the recent <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/01/19/assassins-creed-the-frank-miller-effect-strikes-again/">Assassin&#8217;s Creed debate</a> about Activities An Independently-Minded Female Character Can Be Doing In A Period Setting Apart From Sex Work (Which Is Fine, But Not The Only Available Activity For A Scriptwriter). And WHERE IS THE NEXT PIRATE POST, I hear you cry? PANIC NOT, DEAR READERS. It&#8217;s in the works.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s <strong>Women in Horror Recognition Month</strong>, if you didn&#8217;t know.  Stuck to name many women authors and directors working in the horror genre that aren&#8217;t male?  It&#8217;s not for lack of women, that&#8217;s for sure, and you can discover many of them at Melissa Helwig&#8217;s <a href="http://littlemisszombie.blogspot.com/">Little Miss Zombie blog</a>, <a href="http://splinister.com/post/bloody-women">Maura McHugh&#8217;s blog on Splinister.com</a>, and Re/Action magazine editor <a href="http://sarahdobbs.wordpress.com/">Sarah Dobb&#8217;s blog</a>.</li>
<li>And while BadRep struggles through a storm of BT Line Rental Negotiations to hold on to its Internet Connection Hat, <a href="http://reactionblog.tumblr.com/buy_now">why not order your copy of <strong>Re/Action magazine</strong>, issue 2</a> (check out the rockin&#8217; cover). We&#8217;ve stocked up on our reading materials for the internet drought; drought or no drought you should check it out anyway. Good stuff.</li>
<li><strong>Salon</strong> sums it up: <a href="http://www.salon.com/entertainment/tv/feature/2011/02/15/lara_logan_rape_reaction">What Not To Say About Lara Logan.</a> <em>(Discusses sexual assault.)</em></li>
<li>Meanwhile,<strong> Eulogy</strong> magazine <a href="http://www.eulogymagazine.co.uk/article/ofinterest/detail/id/89">are covering LGBT History Month</a> &#8211; from the point of view of a magazine themed around death, but good to see it on there.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.emcarroll.com/comics/anu/page01.html" target="_blank"><strong>Em Carroll</strong> has drawn a short, beautiful comic for Valentine&#8217;s season</a>.</li>
<li>Do you play computer games? Then hopefully some of the refrains on  <a href="http://fatuglyorslutty.com/"><strong>Fat, Ugly or Slutty</strong></a> won&#8217;t have happened to you! They say: <em>Some players like to send creepy, disturbing, insulting, degrading  and/or just plain rude messages to other online players, usually women. We think this is funny.</em> Could be triggering for some, but it&#8217;s a nice demonstration of solidarity. And here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.fragdolls.com/index.php/blogs/detail/category/rhoulette/a_picture_is_worth_a_thousand_shouted_words">an article about the creation of the site</a>.</li>
