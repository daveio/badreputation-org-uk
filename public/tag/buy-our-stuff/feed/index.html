<p>YES INDEED! Postcards! Sweet!</p>
<p>Note: more about the decision to sell these (apart from the fact you lovely people were asking) is in <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/04/12/coming-soon-to-the-br-towers-shop-page/"><strong>this post by the artist</strong></a>, who is of course the inimitable Markgraf.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a BadRep logo on the reverse, but plenty of room to write your own messages. Stick them all over your walls, send them to your aunt, baffle your colleagues and delight your friends. The images we picked are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5140/5547734262_dc5b29316f_o.jpg">&#8220;The Reptile Whisperer&#8221;</a></li>
<li><a href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4145/5167126365_68e9a59956_o.png">&#8220;Fools! I know surgery!&#8221;</a></li>
<li><a href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4148/5012148667_b7fe343bb5_o.jpg">&#8220;Action Hero Academy&#8221;</a></li>
<li><a href="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5292/5388378521_9e34746509_o.jpg">&#8220;We must leave the Crusades at once!&#8221;</a></li>
</ul>
<p>(The original posts they were done for live in the &#8220;Cinematical&#8221; category on the side bar over on the right.)</p>
<p>The set is £5.99 plus postage. We hope you like!</p>
<p>By the way, cheers massively to everyone who&#8217;s read, publicised, pitched articles to, and said nice things about BadRep! We hit six months of being live the other week. ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED: CELEBRATORY MUG OF TEA.<sup><a href="/2011/05/09/movie-adventure-postcards-now-on-sale/#footnote_0_5019" id="identifier_0_5019" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" I&rsquo;m hardcore.

<p>If you&#8217;re in East London on Sunday, you should totally swing by the <a href="http://www.londonzinesymposium.org.uk/">Zine Symposium.</a> For Hodge will be in attendance armed with a selection of Alphabet goodies, including a very few <strong>ALPHABET POSTERS</strong>.</p>
<p>If you missed the first run (which you probably did, as there were only <strong>ten</strong> and only <strong>one </strong>actually went on public sale) these are currently rarer than tyrannosaurus eggs, and there&#8217;s no guarantee there will be another run in the near future. For the Hodge thy Hodge is a jealous Hodge, and can&#8217;t be dashing to the print shop every five minutes.</p>

<p>Affordable, fun and an opportunity to expose Hodge&#8217;s true identity. Plus loads of cool zines and fun people. What&#8217;s not to like?</p>
<p>Check her out at the bereavement tape table.</p>
<p>&#8230;totally just realised this says &#8216;by hodge&#8217; at the top. i don&#8217;t talk about myself in the third person on a regular basis.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We're selling postcards of Markgraf's movie cartoons. How and why? Find out here.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Check it out, another post from me.  I ran a few short, sexy opening paragraphs through my head for this, like &#8220;You&#8217;ve all heard of SPRING CLEANING, well!  It&#8217;s spring!  And thus I am CLEANING MY ENTIRE FACE&#8221;, or &#8220;INTERNET.  I am your pen-wielding LORD AND MASTER.  It is TIME FOR MY SUPPLICATION.&#8221;</p>
<p>But all of them sounded &#8230;well, like that.  So imagine I&#8217;ve written a far sexier, funnier, less isolatingly-esoteric opening paragraph, and we&#8217;ll run with it.</p>

<p>As you all know by now, I&#8217;m a transgender man.  As you may <em>not </em>know, I&#8217;m doing a medical transition on the good old NHS.  Another thing you won&#8217;t know is that for (disgusting, enraging) reasons I won&#8217;t go into here, my beloved NHS are yanking me about something heartbreakingly chronic as regards my embarkation on hormone therapy.</p>
<p>With this development in mind, I&#8217;m going to see Dr. Curtis of <a href="http://transhealth.co.uk/" target="_blank">Transhealth</a> instead, with the hope that he can cajole my own GP into prescribing me MAGICAL MAN JUICES.</p>
<p>But this requires money.  Of course it does.  So!  To that end, <strong>I&#8217;m going to start selling some art (a selection of which will be right here on BadRep) for your personal delectation. </strong> And that&#8217;s not all!  Ohhh, no.  Let it be known I&#8217;m not a guy who does things by halves.  Halves are <em>for the weak</em>, and I, dear reader, have the strength of SIXTEEN WEREWOLVES MADE OUT OF NUCLEAR SUBMARINES.  Figuratively speaking.  I was rubbish at P.E. at school.  This is purely figurative strength.</p>
<p>Er, yes.  The other non-BadRep related things I&#8217;m selling are limited edition art prints (running to an <em>stupidly</em> restricted run of <em>one copy each</em> due to costs) of my own work one of my own websites.<sup><a href="/2011/04/12/coming-soon-to-the-br-towers-shop-page/#footnote_0_4785" id="identifier_0_4785" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" You heard that right.  My real website.  Where I really live.  With my real actual name.  This totally feels like relinquishing my superhero identity.  BUT HOW WILL I NOW FIGHT CRIME ">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The relevant link, if you&#8217;d like to spend an extortionate amount of money on a single-edition print of some filthy gorgeous pin-up art, <a href="http://goldfeathers.insanejournal.com/12942.html" target="_blank">is right the hell here</a>.  They are vastly more expensive than the things I&#8217;ll be selling here on BadRep &#8211; but they&#8217;re one each, and <em>that&#8217;s all there will ever be.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Right here on the good ship BadRep, however, <strong>I&#8217;m going to be selling wee postcard prints of <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/tag/markgrafs-movie-adventures/">your favourite film review cartoons </a><em>and</em> amusing stickers with which you can dazzle and confuse your friends and enemies! </strong> And if you&#8217;re especially good, I&#8217;ll sell off the<strong> original pen drawings</strong> of the comics, too, for I am a generous god, and have far too much original artwork in my house.  Also, it&#8217;s on the back of the bulk condom packaging I steal from work.  It&#8217;s like upcycling!  Only with more &#8230;sneaky sexual health awareness?  I have no idea.</p>
<p>Watch this space for inadvisable BadRep merch like a hawk with nineteen eyes <em>that never sleeps</em>.  And then you can rest assured that your money has helped fund some totally inadvisable facial hair.</p>
<p>(Psst: The link I mentioned earlier takes you to my sketchblog.  If you want to look at my hip, swanky portfolio, <a href="http://from-eyes.black-ink.org" target="_blank">that&#8217;s right here</a>.)</p>
<ol class="footnotes"><li id="footnote_0_4785" class="footnote"> You heard that right.  My real website.  Where I really live.  <em>With my real actual name. </em> This totally feels like relinquishing my superhero identity.  BUT HOW WILL I NOW FIGHT CRIME </li></ol>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the  things that I think makes this blog a little bit special, if I say it  myself, is our illustrators, the most prolific of whom so far are Markgraf and Hodge.</p>
<p>Regular readers&#8217;ll have noticed we&#8217;re nearing the end of the <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/category/alphabet/">Alphabet series</a> &#8211; and we&#8217;ve had interest from folk asking whether we plan to release any prints.</p>
<p>So here it is, guys: the <strong><a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/shop">Alphabet print shop page</a>.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Hodge has taken some nice photos of the prints, which you can see if you click through. This is not one of them.</p>
