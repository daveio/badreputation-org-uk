					<description><![CDATA[Q: How many feminists does it take to change a light bulb?
A: THAT'S NOT FUNNY!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Please welcome the glorious <strong>Hannah Eiseman-Renyard</strong> to the guestpost soapbox&#8230; </em></p>
<blockquote><p>Q: How many feminists does it take to change a light bulb?</p>
<p>A: THAT&#8217;S NOT FUNNY!</p></blockquote>
<p>I love live comedy, honest I do. I spent two weeks at the <strong>Edinburgh Fringe Festival</strong> last year and I&#8217;ll be there for the full three weeks this year. Some of my best friends are (very good) comedians. However, as a scene: live comedy has a problem. I haven&#8217;t been an aficionado for many years, so maybe it was always there &#8211; but if <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2010/sep/10/rape-jokes-in-comedy">recent articles</a> are anything to go by; it seems to be growing. Increasingly, the search for &#8216;edgy&#8217; material is translating into a scene where the recoil laugh &#8211; the <em>I-can&#8217;t-believe-you-just-said-that </em>laugh &#8211; is the only one aimed for. The targets are &#8216;soft&#8217; &#8211; minorities and marginalized groups &#8211; and the jokes prod at the same old prejudices. The numbers of times I come home from a comedy gig wanting to dry-clean my brain is rising.</p>

A sketch group of white, able-bodied young men performed a series of female grotesques which were so consistently unpleasant that &#8211; though cheerily presented &#8211; the unmistakable undercurrent to the evening was &#8216;we really don&#8217;t like women much.&#8217; Most sketches involved a member of the group donning a plastic wig to &#8216;be a girl&#8217; &#8211; and every female character was a Lolita, a whore, a woman giving birth or a mother who hated her children. The punchlines ranged from coat hanger abortions to incest to rape to paedophilia. At my table, from about halfway through, we didn&#8217;t laugh so much as look to each other for reaction shots and a reality check. This troupe&#8217;s final skit was a song and dance number, the &#8216;Cell Block Tango&#8217; from <strong>Chicago</strong>, with the <a href="http://www.allmusicals.com/lyrics/chicago/cellblocktango.htm">words</a> changed to &#8216;<em>she</em> had it coming&#8217;. Had there not been other people on the bill who I really wanted to see, I would have walked out then and there.</p>
<p>The problem is more widespread than just <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/theatreblog/2010/aug/18/edinburgh-comedy-porn-gimp-fight">one shit comedy troupe </a>. People more eloquent than myself have pointed out this <a href="http://chris-coltrane.livejournal.com/405924.html">return to the bad old days</a>. It seems like the decades of hard-earned progress, a basic standard of &#8216;don&#8217;t be a shit to the marginalised&#8217;, is being discarded because now it&#8217;s apparently ironic. Sexism is increasingly tolerated (after all, everything&#8217;s sorted and equal now, so just lighten up, bitch) and other kinds of prejudice are also creeping back, too. &#8216;It&#8217;s not racist, it&#8217;s just un-PC, and no one likes political correctness. So, while we&#8217;re at it, what about those immigrants, homos, and the disabled, aye?&#8217;</p>
<p>Increasingly comedians who get pulled up for saying genuinely unpleasant things (I&#8217;m looking at you, <a href="http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2010/12/09/12343/jordans_fury_over_frankie_boyle_gag_"><strong>Frankie Boyle</strong></a>) have taken this to be their selling point and then upped the ante in general douchery. While Jordan, the gossip-magazines&#8217; favourite glamour model, might seem a fair target, when exactly did her disabled son become fair game, too? Let alone in a joke about incest and rape. I&#8217;ll repeat that: an incest-rape joke about a disabled eight-year-old child. </p>
<p>While I&#8217;m sure there has always been some truly unpleasant comedy around, its apparent mainstream acceptance is a new trend. The Frankie Boyle joke aired on Channel 4. This worries me because our words do carry a power &#8211; they reflect how we see the world, but they also set our standards for what is normal, acceptable, okay. The trickle-down effect has real-world consequences. The <a href="http://fugitivus.wordpress.com/2009/06/24/a-woman-walks-into-a-rape-uh-bar/">rise of the rape joke</a> can be a horrific trigger for those who have experienced it. In increments, these themes &#8211; packaged as entertainment &#8211; normalise these horrors and dismiss their seriousness.  </p>
<p>This is not an argument for censorship &#8211; I had fervent arguments a few years ago with Daily Fail-reading colleagues about whether <strong>Jerry Springer: The Opera</strong> should be shown on TV (yes, yes, a thousand times yes!) &#8211; but there is a huge middle ground between Mary Whitehouse prudery and comedy which is getting pretty close to hatespeech. Please, guys: self-regulate a little by engaging the brain.</p>
<p>Some would argue that if I don&#8217;t like this brand of comedy, I just shouldn&#8217;t watch it. To some extent they&#8217;re right, and I do try. When I saw a poster in Edinburgh for a standup show called &#8216;The Lying Bitch and the Wardrobe&#8217; (I see what you did there) I had a pretty strong inkling that this wouldn&#8217;t be my kind of thing and I didn&#8217;t go. But on a mixed bill (as almost all small live comedy gigs are) there&#8217;s rarely any warning what each person will do &#8211; so while you might have gone along because you recognise one name that you like, there is no disclosure until you&#8217;re hearing it that the third act, Joe Bloggs, will be your prejudiced asshat for the evening, berating you all with a microphone for at least ten minutes.</p>
<p>Oh, and you paid to see this.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think anything should be off-limits &#8211; but some topics are so unpleasant (not to mention increasingly over-mined) that if a comedian wants to tackle them they will need to be so damn funny, so ingenious, original, tactful &#8211; that 80% of comedians just shouldn&#8217;t bother. Needless to say, the 80% that aren&#8217;t up to speed don&#8217;t get this, and the 20% that can do it well often have better things to do than prod triggertastic subjects and tired old clichés with a great big stick. They&#8217;re off crafting material that makes you belly-laugh (and think) rather than just titter nervously in disbelief.</p>

<p>I think the thing which is missing (besides originality) is a measure of basic empathy. In the increasingly desperate search for &#8216;dark&#8217; and &#8216;cutting edge&#8217; material, comedians forget that a lot of their lazily-picked targets are people. Real people. People with feelings and also (self-interest alert, guys:) <em>people who go to comedy gigs.</em></p>
<p>The rising amount of &#8216;ironic&#8217; misogyny is not creating a particularly friendly environment for a certain 50% of punters. Last year I went to the <strong>Comedy Store</strong> to see twelve different comedians being filmed for <a href="http://www.theworldstandsup.com"><strong>The World Stands Up</strong></a>. I wasn&#8217;t entirely sure if the person who&#8217;d invited me along had intended the evening as a date or not, so it was potentially awkward already. Then, as the evening unfolded, four out of twelve comedians used &#8216;bad fellatio&#8217; as the bedrock of their sets. One standup spent his whole set mocking his wife for not pleasuring him correctly. In the narratives that we heard that night, women&#8217;s main role was as dispensers of sexual favours &#8211; and we couldn&#8217;t even do that right. Thanks, guys. I haven&#8217;t been back to the Comedy Store since.</p>
<p>For another example, I was once out with a group for a friend&#8217;s birthday when a standup did a set about making a mess in the disabled toilet and blaming it on a disabled person. While he wasn&#8217;t to know that birthday girl, sat in the front row, had cerebral palsy, why did he think this would be a good topic in the first place? How many times has he encouraged the able-bodied to laugh at this disadvantaged minority&#8217;s expense?</p>

Catherine Semark performing at Edinburgh Fringe. Photo by me. </p></div>One piece of etiquette that people seem to be riding roughshod over is whether you have a &#8216;claim&#8217; to your material. While there aren&#8217;t any rules about who is allowed to talk about what, whether or not you&#8217;re on the receiving end of a prejudice can make a huge difference to whether or not you have the empathy, warmth, and originality to do it well.  <strong>Richard Pryor</strong>, <strong>Omid Djalili</strong>, <strong>Sarah Silverman</strong>, or <strong>Goodness Gracious Me</strong> on race: usually very good. <strong>Jim Davidson</strong> on race: enough said.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t an argument for &#8216;nice&#8217; comedy. Some of my favourite comedians are pretty darn dark and twisted &#8211; <strong>Bill Hicks</strong>, <strong>Dylan Moran</strong>, and I heartily recommend London sketch group <a href="http://www.thebetamales.com"><strong>The Beta Males</strong></a>  &#8211; but the &#8216;type&#8217; of twisted is crucial.  Jokes are about status &#8211; people use them every day to agree boundaries of what&#8217;s acceptable, and with that comes a certain amount of responsibility. When activist comedians such as <strong>Mark Thomas</strong> or <strong>Kate Smurthwaite</strong> use humour to mock people in power for making bad decisions, that&#8217;s something very different to a middle class standup laying into &#8216;chavs&#8217; for &#8216;talking funny and drinking cheap booze&#8217;.</p>
<p>Anger and humour are very often interlinked, but <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2011/feb/05/top-gear-offensive-steve-coogan ">where you aim that anger makes all the difference</a>. Aim it &#8216;up&#8217; at deserving, more powerful targets and it&#8217;s subversive, it can hold people to account &#8211; satire has a long and proud tradition. Aim that anger &#8216;down&#8217; at the underdog and it&#8217;s tired, old and &#8211; frankly &#8211; it&#8217;s bullying.  </p>
