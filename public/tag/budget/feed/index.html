										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An article was published in <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2010/oct/22/yvette-cooper-fawcett-society-cuts?CMP=twt_iph">today&#8217;s Guardian</a> on the importance of connecting three things: being able to add up, an appreciation for consequences and understanding the laws that govern this country. A decision, which I personally support, was taken by the <a href="http://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/index.asp?PageID=1171">Fawcett Society</a> to take the government to court over the gender inequality in the budget cuts announced this week. Cuts will affect <a href="http://liberalconspiracy.org/2010/03/10/tuc-women-will-be-hit-hardest-by-public-sector-cuts/">women more than men</a>, and on the back of a recession in which the only reason that more women held on to their jobs than men was because we are <a href="http://www.tuc.org.uk/extras/womenandrecessiononeyearon.pdf">over-represented in the public sector</a>. See the problem here?</p>

<p>To head off any arguments at the pass, I believe that these cuts are more a <strong>political decision rather then an economic one</strong> and that the government has taken over a country in a time of <em>perceived</em> crisis and confusion, using the &#8220;chaos&#8221; as a convenient smokescreen to push through its own agenda without the appropriate debate, safeguards or reference to GCSE economics textbooks. But the wrong-headedness of the budget is better discussed by <a href="http://liberalconspiracy.org/2010/10/20/countering-the-coalition-cuts-narrative-a-myth-busting-guide/">Liberal Conspiracy</a> and <a href="http://www.redpepper.org.uk/Countering-the-cuts-myths">Red Pepper</a>. Direct arguments over the necessity of the cuts there.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking specifically about the gulf of difference between what is<em> legally allowable</em> and what is <em>morally correct</em>, and more  importantly what we can do to bridge the divide. I&#8217;m not going to back  down on my assertion that morality is the right word to use here &#8211; a  budget which is demonstrably more unfair (it&#8217;s a generally unfair  budget) to women than to men is an<em> immoral budget</em>. So far, so philosophical.</p>
<p>This is where it gets better. This is where we get practical. The valuable question posed by the Fawcett Society is whether it is  also an <em>illegal budget</em>, because if so, then there are grounds for  actual change. Not only in this instance but for the future. If they  succeed then there will be precedent for further challenges to unequal,  unacceptable political decisions.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;we are all in this together.</p>
<p>&#8211; George Osborne, Conservative Conference Speech, 4 October 2010</p></blockquote>
<p>Good point George, but not in the way you think we are.  A man who wants us to pay <a href="http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/news/article.html?in_article_id=514832&amp;in_page_id=2">whilst large companies don&#8217;t</a> , who grew up on a fat trust fund and is the heir apparent to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_Baronets">Osborne Baronetcy of Ballentaylor</a> is probably only dimly aware of the Real World Implications of the &#8220;this&#8221; that &#8220;we&#8221; appear to be &#8220;in&#8221;. Nonetheless, he has one bit right. The key word is &#8220;together&#8221;. We &#8211; the actual, genuine we &#8211; who are going to bear the brunt of these cuts must use the laws that we have to protect the rights that we need. Laws do not stand up for themselves. We need to make the system work for us. The tools for change are there. We need the knowledge to wield them and we must show<strong> solidarity</strong> with those who do.</p>
<p>Yes, I used the &#8220;s&#8221; word. It&#8217;s an old fashioned word but so are &#8220;honour&#8221; and &#8220;truth&#8221; and &#8220;love&#8221; and I like them all.</p>
<blockquote><p>Solidarity is not a matter of altruism. Solidarity comes from the  inability to tolerate the affront to our own integrity of passive or  active collaboration in the oppression of others, and from the deep  recognition of our most expansive self-interest. From the recognition  that, like it or not, our liberation is bound up with that of every  other being on the planet, and that politically, spiritually, in our  heart of hearts we know anything else is unaffordable.<br />
&#8211; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora_Levins_Morales">Aurora Levins Morales</a>, Medicine Stories (1998)</p></blockquote>
<p>We must work together, and use whatever means are at our disposal to ensure that the laws that should protect us are enforced. Otherwise they are literally worth nothing. Just words and empty promises. Rather like a group of politicians I could mention. So yes, it&#8217;s absolutely time to pull together and muck in and all those other buzz words that seem to have echoes of the Blitz, trying to soft-soap us into accepting being short changed for some nebulous &#8220;greater good&#8221;. Don&#8217;t be fooled.</p>
<p>Challenge the cuts. Because we&#8217;re all in this together.</p>
