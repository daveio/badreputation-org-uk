										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Hitchcock&#8217;s <strong>Psycho</strong> came out in 1960, its shower scene was instantly a sensation. Three minutes and fifty cuts, it broke rules previously sacrosanct: for starters, coming about forty minutes into the film, it killed off Janet Leigh, the film&#8217;s protagonist &#8211; with whom the audience had been invited to identify from those first opening shots of her carefully nondescript underwear. Not only this, its fifty cuts served the purpose of (in the director&#8217;s own words) &#8216;transferring the menace from the screen into the mind of the audience&#8217;. Viewers were no longer the blonde; they were the psycho. An uncomfortable shift.</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/psycho.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="13364" data-permalink="/2013/03/18/the-shower-scene-in-silver-linings-playbook/psycho/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/psycho.jpg?fit=492%2C755&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="492,755" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="psycho" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/psycho.jpg?fit=195%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/psycho.jpg?fit=492%2C755&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignleft  wp-image-13364" alt="psycho" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/psycho.jpg?resize=194%2C297" width="194" height="297" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>In <strong>Silver Linings Playbook</strong>, the menace is all in in the mind &#8211; it&#8217;s a film about mental illness. It is presumably for this reason that director David O. Russell has chosen to reproduce that shower scene in it &#8211; though, represented via a series of individual flashbacks, he&#8217;s added some more visceral cuts into it, as well as a middle-aged professor who&#8217;s having an affair with this Norman Bates&#8217;s wife.</p>
<p>The film follows Pat (Bradley Cooper), who is bipolar, and his quest to get his marriage back together after returning home from a psychiatric hospital. We learn that his most recent breakdown was precipitated on discovering his wife Nikki in the aforementioned shower with a colleague; he attacked the man, which brought him up against assault charges and eventually landed him in the institution. Back home at the beginning of the film, Pat wants to get Nikki, and his marriage, back &#8211; despite his continuing mood swings, refusal to take medication and restraining order.</p>
<p>Then he meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a young woman whose husband has recently died in traumatic circumstances. She is similarly Troubled (she&#8217;s been fired for sleeping with all her co-workers) and they hit it off, in a vague way. She agrees to take a letter to Nikki if Pat will partner her in a dance competition.</p>
<p>The inevitable happens.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/silver-linings.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="13361" data-permalink="/2013/03/18/the-shower-scene-in-silver-linings-playbook/silver-linings/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/silver-linings.jpg?fit=214%2C317&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="214,317" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="silver linings" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/silver-linings.jpg?fit=203%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/silver-linings.jpg?fit=214%2C317&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-13361" alt="poster for Silver Linings Playbook" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/silver-linings.jpg?resize=214%2C317" width="214" height="317" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>If you listen to Hollywood, there are dance competitions happening in every small town, every three minutes, just waiting for someone to do some self-actualisation through dance &#8211; as in dance movie stalwarts such as <strong>Strictly Ballroom</strong>, <strong>Flashdance</strong> or, its British equivalent, the Arts Council-funded <strong>Billy Elliot</strong>. This one brings plenty of opportunities for personal development, which &#8211; though not so pronounced as the ur-dance movies &#8211; is actually why Pat agrees to do it: he wants to prove to Nikki that he has changed, and grown, since the shower incident. Cinematic history tells him this is the way to do it.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, in <strong>Silver Linings Playbook</strong>, development through dance is not really the point: the dancing pops up towards the second half of the film, and while the rehearsals do force the characters to spend a lot of time doing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MN9Khh_K2s" target="_blank">semi-erotic stuff</a> together, it&#8217;s not the primary impetus behind their falling in love.</p>
<p>Indeed, if you accept that dance in golden-era Hollywood is usually implied sex<sup><a href="/2013/03/18/the-shower-scene-in-silver-linings-playbook/#footnote_0_13042" id="identifier_0_13042" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" Considerably less &lsquo;implied&rsquo; in the 1980s, as with the eponymous moves of&nbsp;Dirty Dancing. ">1</a></sup>, often in the context of romantic relationships between show-people who dance as part of their job (here, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFqFMxIeeU0" target="_blank">Fred Astaire tries to win Ann Miller back as his g/f by getting her to do the dance they perform on stage</a>), you could say that <strong>Silver Linings </strong>is less about sex than it is about Feelings.</p>
<p>Feelings (that&#8217;s a capital F), are by contrast the preserve of the classic romcom, which &#8211; a true product of the Eighties &#8211; features extended, over-analytical examinations of the Self. It&#8217;s Hugh Grant and Woody Allen being neurotic and too self-aware; it&#8217;s realising you&#8217;re in love just in time to run down an aeroplane. It&#8217;s the power of the mind &#8211; its hopes, fears and wants &#8211; to overcome practical obstacles. And in <strong>Silver Linings Playbook</strong>, as I say, it&#8217;s all about the mind. It&#8217;s a romcom for the post-Hugh Grant generation, if you will.</p>
<p>Now, personally, I didn&#8217;t find the treatment of mental health as offensive as I know some did &#8211; David O. Russell has commented in interviews that he drew a lot from the experience of having a son with bipolar disorder, which does help. One thing that did bug me, though, was its pairing of a bipolar man with longstanding mental health issues with a hypersexual woman recovering from a traumatic bereavement. Pat&#8217;s problems are longstanding, but Tiffany&#8217;s troubles clearly have their origin in grief, and they happen to manifest themselves in a pattern of sexual behaviour that, as recounted, elicits visible salivation from her male companion. We might say, in fact, that in this film, there is Serious Mental Illness, and there is Sexy Mental Illness. That Pat&#8217;s initial crime puts him in the cinematic shoes of Norman Bates, whose murder is at root sexually motivated &#8211; though it is repeated here as a grotesque husband-on-lover attack &#8211; underscores this, though admittedly at one remove.</p>
<p>This is why the <strong>Psycho</strong> crib, for me, was a key moment &#8211; and partly because its appearance in the film is so downright weird. It parallels the dance competition trope as an interjection of popular film history, but I suppose it also draws together some of the film&#8217;s key themes: notably, though arguably ironically, psychosis (Hitchcock&#8217;s film played a major part in popularising the slang word <em>psycho</em>) and what you might very crudely call Hollywood &#8216;monster-cam&#8217;.</p>
<p>I suppose one reason for including the scene (something I spent a long time puzzling over) was that, by putting the audience in the eye-view of a man mid-breakdown unleashing his rage upon two people who happen to be naked (and one of them a woman) shows the terrible power of the mental threats the film explores: we see their vulnerability, and we are invited to consider the gender issues the attack brings to the surface. Within the context of the plot, it makes sense of Nikki&#8217;s need for a restraining order and perhaps even makes an ironic comment on the thigh-rubbing Hitchcock is widely accepted to have been doing throughout his own shower scene. It certainly makes you think back to the portrayal of mental illness in the deeply exploitative <strong>Psycho</strong>. In that sense, <strong>Silver Linings Playbook</strong> actually comes out reasonably well.</p>
<p>So, should you go and see it? I&#8217;d imagine if you were going to, you&#8217;ll have done so by now. But I think it&#8217;s worth seeing &#8211; despite those dodgy gender politics, it certainly makes you think.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are a few things that I&#8217;ve decided are never going out of fashion: pirates and zombies.  They&#8217;re ubiquitous.  They&#8217;re <em>everywhere</em>.  Everyone&#8217;s party either wants you to come as one or other or a mixture of the two, or wouldn&#8217;t mind if you did.  This is no bad thing: zombies are obviously a reclamation of the middle-class stigmatisation of the working class as a shambling, faceless, flesh-eating horde, and pirates are &#8230;pirates.  Who wouldn&#8217;t want to be a pirate?  There&#8217;s <em>loads</em> of stuff to like about pirates.  The ships, the clothes, the beards and the array of innovative tropical sexually-acquired infections.  Rum, sodomy and the lash. <em>Anyone&#8217;s</em> idea of fun.</p>
<p><strong>***As is usual, dear readers, the BadRep pirate flag reading SPOILER WARNING &#8211; only mild to moderate this time, but still &#8211; is hereby hoisted here! ***</strong></p>
<p>So, Britain&#8217;s most beloved animation house, <strong>Aardman Animations</strong>, the cheerful cohort behind treasured characters <strong>Wallace &amp; Gromit</strong> and my personal comfort-watchers <a href="http://www.aardman.com/features/released-features/chicken-run/"><strong> Chicken Run</strong></a> and <a href="http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/rex_the_runt/"><strong>Rex The Runt</strong></a>, really can&#8217;t go wrong with a film entitled <strong> The Pirates! In An Adventure With Scientists</strong>.  It&#8217;s adapted from <strong>Gideon Defoe&#8217;s</strong> <a href="http://www.gideondefoe.com/page4.htm">series</a> of childrens&#8217; books of the same name and derivations thereof, one of which is called <strong>The Pirates! In An Adventure With Communists</strong>, and if that doesn&#8217;t make you deliriously excited, then I&#8217;m afraid we can&#8217;t be friends.  I haven&#8217;t read them yet, but I&#8217;ve made arrangements to get them into my eager paws as soon as possible because how can I not?  Pirates!  Everyone likes pirates.</p>
<p>It was the poster that drew my eye first.  Witness:</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/PiratesTeaserPoster.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="10676" data-permalink="/2012/04/16/at-the-movies-the-pirates-in-an-adventure-with-scientists/piratesteaserposter/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/PiratesTeaserPoster.jpg?fit=300%2C444&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="300,444" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="PiratesTeaserPoster" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/PiratesTeaserPoster.jpg?fit=202%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/PiratesTeaserPoster.jpg?fit=300%2C444&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/PiratesTeaserPoster.jpg?resize=300%2C444" alt="The poster for The Pirates! In An Adventure With Scientists. There is a banner at the top showing the title of the film.  The poster design is a sort of cone of people, with the Pirate Captain (a pale-skinned man with a large brown beard) central.  To the left of him, there is a dark-skinned, cunning-looking female pirate with dark hair and a large cutlass.  To his right, also holding his arm, is a pale-skinned femme pirate dressed in pastel colours with a large, ginger beard.  Beneath them, there are assorted other characters, such as Queen VIctoria, looking vicious and making an &quot;Off with his head&quot; gesture with her hands, and a pirate that looks rather like Elvis, only a pirate.  There is also a mermaid, a galleon, a monkey in a suit, a heap of gold and two cannons.  Assorted pirates and Charles Darwin populate the frame of the image, dangling off airships.

<p><em>PIRATES!</em> it says.  And there they are.  There&#8217;s a nice representation of different genders, ages, ethnicities and beards on the poster, and I was all excited for a nice diverse film &#8211; the sort I tend to dream about.</p>
<p>SHAME IT&#8217;S A LIE.</p>
<p>Well, no, I&#8217;m exaggerating &#8211; it&#8217;s not quite a bare-faced man-churned fictivated sin-speech, but it&#8217;s pretty fallacious.  The main character is that chap in the middle there, the Pirate Captain (<strong>Hugh Grant</strong>).  The pirate to the left of him, Cutlass Liz &#8211; voiced by the brilliant <strong>Salma Hayek</strong> &#8211; is an award-winning Pirate Of The Year, full of swash, buckle and plunder-power, and gets <em>literally no screen-time in which she isn&#8217;t a sex object.</em>  Seriously.  She turns up, wiggles, alludes to her piratical prowess and then&#8230; isn&#8217;t seen again!  She has, like, three scenes!  And one of them is in the dreams of the Pirate Captain where she&#8217;s all, &#8220;Ooh Pirate Captain, I am UNDONE&#8221;.</p>
<p>The pirate to the right of said Pirate Captain in the poster goes by the moniker Suspiciously Curvaceous Pirate (they&#8217;re all &#8220;[Adjective] Pirate&#8221;). Voiced by <strong>Ashley Jensen</strong>, she&#8217;s a dragged-up pirate with an amazing false beard and a sweet Scottish chirp &#8211; who also gets very little screen-time or lines, and whose characterisation appears to revolve around the fact that she likes sparkly jewels, pastel colours and fancies the captain a bit.  The humour of her character is almost exclusively that she&#8217;s a cross-dressing woman.  Now, I&#8217;m never okay with boys in drag being sent up purely for being boys in drag, so why would I be okay with it if the character&#8217;s female?</p>
<p>Not great, is it?</p>
<p>That said, it&#8217;s not all bad news for lady characters in this, but from a rather unexpected source: the villain, voiced by the legendary <strong>Imelda Staunton</strong>, Queen Victoria (&#8220;Look at my crest! What does it say?  I HATE PIRATES.&#8221;) is absolutely magnificent.  She&#8217;s perfect.  Stop making that face.  This is the badassest Queen Vic you have <em>ever</em> seen, and I don’t think it’s possible to not fancy her even a little bit after the credits roll.  She has a <em>battle skirt</em> that clanks aside to reveal a) jodphurs and b) TWO KATANAS.  Come <em>on</em>.  How many other films have had Queen Victoria fighting pirates with katanas before getting vanquished by GCSE-classroom science?  FUCKING ZERO.  THIS IS A UNIQUE CINEMATOGRAPHICAL EXPERIENCE.</p>
<p>OVERALL, the above issues aside, it&#8217;s a very funny film &#8211; the school of humour whereby if one joke doesn&#8217;t wash with you, never fear! there&#8217;ll be another one along in a tick &#8211; and it&#8217;s rich with classic Aardman background detail (the pirate ship has a fusebox, for example, and watch the faces of the taxidermy animals in Charles Darwin&#8217;s (<strong>David Tennant</strong>) house during the bathtub chase scene!).  <strong>Martin Freeman&#8217;s</strong> second-in-command pirate actually looks a bit like him, which is neatly appealing, and <strong>Brian Blessed&#8217;s</strong> megaphonic turn as the Pirate King is predictably godlike.  The dodo is gorgeously animated.  I wish there&#8217;d been more scientists doing science-y things, but then I was imagining something dreadful involving shiny gloves, tailored labcoats and experimentation, and there are reasons I haven&#8217;t been allowed to make films for children and <em>that&#8217;s one of them.</em></p>
<p>But I did make a new poster, to give the neglected characters just a bit more attention. I made Cutlass Liz look a bit more badass, too, on account of her being badass and therefore deserving of a badass coat:</p>

Above them, there is a banner reading, &quot;BETTER REPRESENTATION!&quot; To the right of the central pirate, there is a thin man with scruffy blond hair and glasses - the artist - standing with his mouth wide open in delight, hunched over and staring at the central pirate in what looks like fan worship.  Above his head, there is a banner reading, &quot;WHAT AM I DOING HERE&quot;.  Behind him, there is a small cannon.  It is labelled with a banner reading, &quot;CANNONS!&quot;  Beneath the three figures, there is a large, green sea-serpent coiled into the bottom left (a banner next to it reads, &quot;MONSTERS!&quot;, and a man in a crown with a large beard in the bottom right.  The man has a large quiff and a frilly shirt.  He is giving a thumbs-up and grinning.  Above his head, there is a banner reading, &quot;Oh fine, Brian Blessed&quot;.

<h3>YOU SHOULD SEE THIS FILM BECAUSE:</h3>
<ul>
<li> The best Queen Victoria you have literally ever seen</li>
<li>It&#8217;s really painfully funny</li>
<li>Who doesn&#8217;t want to see Brian Blessed being a pirate king, seriously</li>
<li>There&#8217;s Flight Of The Concords on the soundtrack!</li>
<li>Thank god for stop-motion claymation &#8211; surely the finest animation technique ever? THIS HOUSE BELIEVES: YES</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>YOU SHOULD NOT SEE THIS FILM BECAUSE:</h3>
<ul>
<li>It promises a lot in the trailer and poster in terms of ethnic/gender representation and then doesn&#8217;t deliver</li>
<li>I frankly wanted more science</li>
<li>And more Brian Blessed</li>
<li>More of everything that wasn&#8217;t the cis/white/male lead characters, actually, I mean they were great and all but I&#8217;m bored of cis/white/men being the&#8230; we&#8217;ve already had this discussion, internet, leave me be</li>
</ul>
