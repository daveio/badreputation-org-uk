					<description><![CDATA["I can never tell my adopted daughter that I'm an ex-con!," Valjean howls, sheathing his Adamantium talons and fleeing for the hills.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>It&#8217;s only fair to tell you that there&#8217;s spoilers in here, but guys, the musical&#8217;s been out for literally decades! I mean, I hadn&#8217;t seen it and didn&#8217;t know the plot or anything, but I think I was the only person left on earth.</strong></p>
<p>Oh, readers. I&#8217;ve done that thing again. I&#8217;ve gone and seen <strong>Les Miserables</strong> without having seen the musical or read the book and now I&#8217;m writing about it without the massive burning swollen bladder of fandom that everyone else seems to have about it, and as such, will probably sound a bit naive. I had <em>literally</em> no idea what it was about. Well, apart from &#8220;France&#8221; and &#8220;revolution&#8221; and some presumably rather miserable people and &#8211; something that was used to successfully sell the whole thing to me &#8211; pretty young men draped attractively about the place in military uniform, covered in blood. Oh, and <strong>Hugh Jackman</strong> singing. He apparently does lots of musicals in Australia, and I was curious to know what that was like, since I know him primarily as the not-very-musical-ready Wolverine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Did I like it? Well&#8230; yes. I think? Sort of. There was a lot that I found either directly unappealing or straight-up baffling, but overall, there was sufficient stuff in there to make me want to see it onstage. And, well, I&#8217;m a sucker for musicals.</p>
<p>The main thing about this film is that it suffers from being a film. There are things that you can only do in the magical reality of the stage, and this particular production (directed by <strong>Tom Hooper</strong>) tries on the whole gritty reality thing (except with people singing all the time) and therefore can&#8217;t get away with similar tricks and tactics. This is most glaringly obvious in how they depict (or not) the passage of time. There were some bits that were completely confusing because I just couldn&#8217;t tell whether or not time was meant to have passed or not. For example, on stage, as my stage-show-fan friend tells me, Fantine (<strong>Anne Hathaway</strong>) can waft in and out of the set to show many days passing between her selling her hair and her teeth before eventually being forced by circumstance into becoming a sex worker. In the film, it looked like she&#8217;d lost her job, and then immediately sold everything in her face and became a sex worker.</p>
<p>I was like, wow that&#8217;s a terrible afternoon.</p>
<p>It happened again after Cosette&#8217;s (<strong>Amanda Seyfried</strong>) wedding. &#8220;I can never tell my adopted daughter that I&#8217;m an ex-con!,&#8221; Valjean howls, sheathing his Adamantium talons and fleeing for the hills, where he staggers into a convent and casually dies in the corner. I assumed he&#8217;d had an ill-publicised heart attack in the carriage on the way over.</p>
<p>The next problem I had with <strong>Les Mis</strong> was the way Valjean was <em>so</em> suffused with his role as apparently French Ex-Con Jesus that for me he ended up being completely impossible to identify with. I found his motives and decisions inexplicable to the point of being hilarious. I wanted to have the film retitled &#8220;Jean Valjean&#8217;s Baffling Sequence Of Life Choices&#8221; because in this rendition at least, he comes off as <em>too</em> saintly, too self-righteous and too&#8230; incongruously self-sacrificial for me to see him as a real person and empathise with him. Ever.</p>

<p>And what on earth was going on with the cinematography when anyone was having a solo? With a stage show, if someone has a solo, you&#8217;ve got them as a figure in context with the set, the extras, all embalmed in live music. So you can empathise with them properly because there&#8217;s this whole holistic musical experience going on. Not so with the film, where the director has decided that the best way to make you empathise with the solo singer is to have a VERY TIGHT CLOSE-UP of the singer&#8217;s face, slightly off-centre, while they cry and sing at the same time. This is not how you make your audience empathise with anyone or anything. I found myself wondering how they&#8217;d done Anne Hathaway&#8217;s makeup while the rest of the cinema sobbed around me.</p>

<p>Right, time to talk about Javert. As my more long-term readers will know, I&#8217;m a <a href="http://villainsexual.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">villainsexual</a> creep, and my darling friend who kindly dragged me from my Doom Fortress to see this flick accurately predicted that I&#8217;d have the hots for Javert. She was not wrong. I have never before fancied <strong>Russell Crowe</strong> in anything ever (in fact, quite the opposite) but I honestly found Javert the only character that I empathised with and found engaging and explicable. Plus, he&#8217;s got an attractive array of uniforms and shiny boots. In fact, that was a great way to tell &#8211; in the absence of any bloody thing else &#8211; the passage of time. It had to be later on: Javert had MOAR BRAID. I&#8217;m okay with that. Time-keeping through the medium of men in uniform? I&#8217;m deleting my phone&#8217;s clock app this afternoon.</p>
<p>I actually quite enjoyed the fatalistic pointlessness of barricade-building rich white boys<sup><a href="/2013/03/05/at-the-movies-les-miserables-or-jean-valjeans-baffling-sequence-of-life-choices/#footnote_0_13028" id="identifier_0_13028" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" Ed&rsquo;s Tiny Note: are they meant to be an underclass? Despite Eddie Redmayne being a Rather Cut-Glass Etonian ;). Anyone read Hugo/able to verify how they&rsquo;re meant to come across?! ">1</a></sup> harping on about no longer being slaves and changing the world and then being run over with cannons. That was grand. I mean, don&#8217;t get me wrong, I&#8217;d love to see a structures-of-oppression-ruining bloody revolution, but this is a film, and I&#8217;m a bloodthirsty little boy with the need for something hard and horrible to counteract Valjean&#8217;s large-overcoated saintliness, so I was overwhelmed with the beauty of their cataclysmic failure. So beautiful. So horrible. So&#8230; uh.</p>

In fact, deserves own, better-orchestrated revolution not being led by Marius &amp; co.</p></div>
<p>Now, Eponine (<strong>Samantha Barks</strong>). Eponine is meant to be an empathic, sadface-inducing character, and she&#8217;s sweet and earnest and I rather liked her. But Marius, the guy she&#8217;s in love with, is <em>so boring</em>. I just wanted her to <em>get over it </em>and find someone <em>interesting</em> who doesn&#8217;t apparently fall madly in love with people when he glimpses their hats from a distance through a crowd.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s always nice to see <strong>Helena Bonham-Carter</strong> reprising her timeless role of &#8220;Cackling Woman With Hair&#8221; (I don&#8217;t think they even give her a costume, do they? That&#8217;s all just her wardrobe), too. And I sincerely hope that after playing Signor Pirelli in <strong>Sweeney Todd</strong>, <strong>Sasha Baron-Cohen</strong> is typecast as Musical Skeevy Comic Relief for the rest of his life and never plays another vaguely-veiled bigoted stereotype ever again.</p>
<p>Overall, it really wasn&#8217;t as miserable as I was expecting. Valjean lives a long and successful life, Cosette and the boring Marius (the gorgeous <strong>Eddie Redmayne</strong>) get married, Fantine&#8217;s wishes are vindicated, all that stuff, and everyone dies happily ever after with a rousing song about sticking it to the man. All this talk about how much sobbing it elicits from people generally makes me wonder if someone&#8217;s snuck into my room at night and glued my tearducts shut. It struck me as generally rather uplifting and &#8220;Oh well! Songs and Christian Love!&#8221; rather than &#8220;DESPAIR AND CHIPS FOR EVERYONE&#8221;.</p>
<p>To summarise! <strong>YOU SHOULD SEE THIS FILM BECAUSE:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The music is genuinely brilliant. Believe the hype.</li>
<li>Everyone plays really, really well. Flawless performances from Anne Hathaway (in particular), Wolverine, and even Russell &#8220;Are You Not Entertained?&#8221; Crowe, who has a spectacularly grizzly, stoic turn as Javert</li>
<li>It really does look exceedingly good</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>YOU SHOULD NOT SEE THIS FILM BECAUSE:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;m not sure how many of the characters feel like real people, honestly</li>
<li>It suffers from its own medium in a few glaringly obvious and immersion-breaking ways</li>
<li>It feels pretty obnoxiously long, but that might just have been me and my bladder having a disagreement</li>
<li>People do sing pretty much all the time and you might be allergic to musicals, but if you&#8217;re allergic to musicals WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO SEE <strong>LES MISERABLES</strong></li>
</ul>

					<description><![CDATA[Calamity Jane starts off the 1953 musical film of the same name as a tomboy, gets humiliated and learns to be a girl, then gets married. In a dress and everything. Despite this, it’s one of my very favourite films.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Team BadRep were sent a writing prompt this month:<em> What is your favourite film or TV series, and why? If it’s what you’d call ‘feminist-friendly’, what about it appealed? If it isn’t, how does that work for you, and are there nonetheless scenes, characters and so on that have stayed with you and continue to occupy a soft spot for you as a feminist pop culture adventurer?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Calamity Jane</strong> (played by <a title="Wikipedia - Doris Day" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doris_Day" target="_blank">Doris Day</a>) starts off the 1953 <a title="IMDB Calamity Jane" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0045591/" target="_blank">musical film</a> of the same name as a tomboy, gets humiliated and learns to be a girl, then gets married. In a dress and everything.</p>
<p>Despite this, it’s one of my very favourite films.</p>
<p>Proud and tomboyish ‘Calam’ is a popular and respected figure in the town of Deadwood. Not just one of the boys, but determined to outshoot, outdrink, outswagger them all. But she&#8217;s met her match in Wild Bill Hickok whom she admires and who grudgingly admires her, although they get into one of those “ooh I hate you and don’t fancy you at all, nope” oneupmanship <a title="YouTube - I Can Do WIthout You" href="http://youtu.be/xlqdEca3hks" target="_blank">songs</a>. Calam and Bill are comrades, but Calam’s in love with the local Lieutenant Danny, and saves his life, but he’s not interested in her. Because he’s a dick, basically.</p>

<p>Anyway, a Proper Lady (Katie) comes to town and becomes friends with Calam, helping her discover her feminine side (I know, I know, just bear with me) and Bill falls unconvincingly in love with her. But when Danny and Katie are discovered KISSING, Calam loses it and threatens to run Katie out of town. She makes a right fool of herself, and Danny is mean about her, but Bill Hickok defends her and goes to console/talk some sense into a bereft Calam. On a still summer night, in a wood, under a silvery moon, etc… they kiss, and conveniently enough it turns out they’ve been in love all along! Everyone makes friends again, Calam marries Bill and Katie marries Danny, even though he’s a knob.</p>
<p>Okay. So there are some tough bits, most notably the repeated references to “female thinking”, and the godawful <a title="YouTube - A Woman's Touch" href="http://youtu.be/swYl_rFe7Qk" target="_blank"><strong>A Woman’s Touch</strong></a> song. I get through this by donning slash goggles, through which it all becomes rather charming and ironic.</p>
<p>There’s even a symbolic castration of Calam at the end when she and Bill get married – they’re just getting on the stagecoach and he finds she has her gun tucked into her wedding dress. They all laugh and he hands it to some random in the crowd. Then they ride off singing etc.</p>
<p>BUT. There is a lot that is loveable about this film, and it’s not as bad as the details above might suggest.</p>
<p>Firstly, Doris Day’s Calam is a wonderful character. Brave, kind, funny and bursting with energy, she leaps about all over the place, and has a habit of firing at the ceiling to get people’s attention. She’s a tomboy but she’s no freak – everyone in the town is fond of her, respects her and humours her habit of exaggerating her own exploits. She’s accepted, not just tolerated. Her flaw is her pride, and the real point of the story is that it’s her pride which is ‘corrected’ and not her masculine habits.</p>
<p>Secondly, although she is engirlied, she doesn’t become a 50s fembot. She wears a few dresses, but mostly she’s out of her buckskins yet still in trousers. There’s no sign at all she’s going to give up riding the stage (or violently oppressing the indigenous population). I think my favourite bit in the whole film is near the end when she’s racing after Katie’s coach to bring her back to Deadwood, and she passes Bill and his mate on her horse. She thunders past, then stops, turns, rides back, kisses him, and rides off again without a word.</p>
<p>His friend says “I don&#8217;t know what kind of life you&#8217;ll have living with that catamount&#8230; but it ain&#8217;t gonna be dull.”</p>
<p>Bill replies: “That&#8217;s for dang sure.” He looks delighted.</p>
<p>Thirdly, although it arrives at a supremely convenient time in that way that musicals have, the relationship between Calam and Bill is a convincing one. Throughout the film there are references to their friendship and campaigns together, and they are clearly fond of each other. He sticks up for her when Danny is being disparaging, and tells her early on he thinks she’d be pretty (if she was a Proper Lady, natch). So when Calamity ‘takes off her glasses’ at the Ball (in fact she’s been covered up in a coat she claims was given to her by General Custer) it isn’t as if he’s only just noticed her. And crucially, rather than trying to put her down or get her to act in a more feminine way, his efforts are about bringing her down to earth from her flights of fancy and towering pride.</p>
<p>It’s not a feminist film. It’s not even <em>close</em>. But Calamity is wonderful, and I think better a film with her in it than not at all.</p>
<p>PS.   The title is a reference to the most famous song in the film, <a title="YouTube - Secret Love" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZALA7sPhYU" target="_blank"><strong>Secret Love</strong></a>, which has become a bit of a gay anthem. My favourite is <a title="YouTube - The Black Hills of Dakota" href="http://youtu.be/p59nrGixAYY" target="_blank"><strong>The Black Hills Of Dakota</strong></a>, although it has a lot less subtext.</p>
<p>PPS.  Don&#8217;t come to this film looking for historical accuracy. Here&#8217;s <a title="Powells Review" href="http://www.powells.com/review/2005_12_30.html" target="_blank">some info</a> on the actual <a title="Wikipedia Image - Calamity Jane" href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Calamity_jane.jpeg/220px-Calamity_jane.jpeg" target="_blank">Calamity Jane</a> and <a title="Wikipedia Image - Wild Bill Hickok" href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Wild_Bill.jpg/220px-Wild_Bill.jpg" target="_blank">Wild Bill Hickok</a>.</p>
