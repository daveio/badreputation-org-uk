										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Inspired by those plucky Pussy Riot gals and their &#8216;being sent to a penal colony for a peaceful protest&#8217; hi-jinks in Russia last year, I set out to find tracks from riot grrrl bands around the world. And just to shift the focus for once, I&#8217;ve ignored the US, Canada, Australia, Japan, Europe and other super wealthy places.</p>
<p>&#8216;Are there grrrls in the majority world?&#8217; I wondered. The answer is yes, and they rock. In fact I&#8217;ve made a <a title="Majority World Riot Grrrl Playlist" href="http://bit.ly/majoritygrrrl" target="_blank"><strong>Majority World Riot Grrrl playlist</strong></a> which can be found for your delectation. Big shout out to <a title="Riot Grrrl Berlin Compilations" href="http://riotgrrrlberlin.tumblr.com/grrrlcompilations" target="_blank">Riot Grrrl Berlin</a> and their fantastic compilations, on which lots of these bands feature.</p>
<h2><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/tank-girl.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="13254" data-permalink="/2013/03/08/majority-world-riot-grrrl/tank-girl/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/tank-girl.jpg?fit=454%2C381&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="454,381" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Tank Girl Nepal Promo Pic" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/tank-girl.jpg?fit=300%2C252&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/tank-girl.jpg?fit=454%2C381&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignleft  wp-image-13254" alt="Tank Girl Nepal Promo Pic" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/tank-girl.jpg?resize=327%2C275" width="327" height="275" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Nepal</h2>
<p>The first band I found was an anarchafeminist outfit from Nepal called <a title="Tank Girl" href="http://kasamaproject.org/2010/04/14/tank-girl-anarcha-feminist-punk-from-nepal/" target="_blank"><strong>Tank Girl</strong></a>. Nepal has a deeply traditional patriarchal society; marital rape was outlawed only in 2006 and still carries just a six month sentence. Rape survivors are often ostracised, having &#8216;brought shame&#8217; to their family and wider community. Dalit (or &#8216;low-caste&#8217;) women face additional discrimination and extremely high levels of violence.</p>
<p>One of Tank Girl&#8217;s members, Sareena Rai, is involved in two other feminist DIY punk bands, <a title="Rai Ko Ris" href="http://diypunknepal.blogspot.com.au/2011/06/short-interview-with-rai-ko-ris.html " target="_blank">Rai Ko Ris</a> and <a title="Nepal" href="ttp://subcultatlas.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/nepal-stories-from-nepal.html " target="_blank">Naya Faya</a>, and works to help Dalit women to protect themselves from gender-based violence, delivering self-defence training in her house. Which is pretty awesome.</p>
<h2>Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia</h2>
<p>I found a few more Asia-Pacific riot grrrl bands, including the adorable <a title="Youtube - Fatal Posporos" href="http://youtu.be/exu28Xt3Trs" target="_blank"><strong>Fatal Posporos</strong></a> from the Philippines and <a title="Myspace - Pretty Riot" href="http://www.myspace.com/prettyriot09 " target="_blank"><strong>Pretty Riot</strong></a> from Indonesia. As well as bands <a title="Hellsister" href="http://ohmytracks.com/#/music/Hellsister" target="_blank"><strong>Hellsister</strong></a> and <a title="Myspace - Dance On Your Grave" href="http://www.myspace.com/doygmusic" target="_blank"><strong>Dance On Your Grave</strong></a>, the scene in Malaysia was (and hopefully still is) large enough to support a zine distro called <a title="Grrrl:Rebel" href="http://grrrlzines.net/interviews/grrrlrebel.htm" target="_blank"><strong>Grrrl:Rebel</strong></a>. “Through zines, people in the scene are much more exposed to stuffs that were somewhat limited to them and the public before” founder Carol told <a title="Grrrzines" href="http://grrrlzines.net/" target="_blank">GrrrlZines.net</a> in 2001. “In countries like Malaysia and Singapore, you would get arrested if you write any articles that can be considered as threats to the government.”</p>
<p>It&#8217;s comments like that which I find so remarkable, dropped into interviews about the role of girls in the punk scene and the best local bands which could kind of be about anywhere.</p>
<h2>Africa and the Middle East</h2>
<p>While I couldn&#8217;t find any trace of a riot grrrl scene in Africa, I did happen upon a 2011 documentary called <a title="Afropop - Punk In Africa" href="http://www.afropop.org/wp/6866/punk-in-africa/" target="_blank"><strong>Punk In Africa</strong></a> which sounds good. And in the Middle East, grrrls are thin on the ground, but judging from the cracking <a title="MidEast Tunes" href="http://mideastunes.com/" target="_blank">MidEastTunes</a> website there are plenty of women active in dark metal and goth, including Bahrain&#8217;s first all-girl metal band <a title="LA Times - Scarlet Tear" href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/babylonbeyond/2010/08/bahrain-.html" target="_blank"><strong>Scarlet Tear</strong></a>.</p>
<h2>Mexico, Venezuela and Brazil</h2>
<p>South America does seem to have a sizeable riot grrrl base &#8211; my cursory search turned up bands in Mexico, Venezuela, Chile, Colombia and Argentina. <a title="Myspace - Le Butcherettes" href="http://www.myspace.com/lebutcherettes " target="_blank"><strong>Le Butcherettes</strong></a> from Mexico are definitely worth a listen, and I&#8217;d like to find more by a Venezuelan skapunk outfit called <a title="Pure Volume - 7 Potencias" href="http://www.purevolume.com/7potencias" target="_blank"><strong>7 Potencias</strong></a> who have a song called &#8216;Feminista de Bolsillo&#8217;, which I&#8217;m led to believe translates as &#8216;Pocket Feminist&#8217;.</p>
<p>The biggest scene seems to be in Brazil, which boasts a huge list of bands and artists, including <a title="Myspace - Dominatrix" href="http://www.myspace.com/contatodominatrix" target="_blank"><strong>Dominatrix</strong></a>, <a title="Bandcamp - Siete Armas" href="http://sietearmas.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Siete Armas</strong></a> and <a title="Myspace - Bertha Lutz" href="http://www.myspace.com/bandaberthalutz" target="_blank"><strong>Bertha Lutz</strong></a>, with her irresistibly-titled track &#8216;Feminism? Yes Please!&#8217;.</p>
<p>Bit of context: while Brazil is the world&#8217;s sixth largest economy, there is still vast inequality. And although it currently has a female President for the first time in Dilma Rouseff, women make up just 8.6% of the seats in Parliament. Abortion is legal only to save a woman&#8217;s life or in cases of rape, and in 2010, it was <a title="Wikigender - Brazil" href="http://www.wikigender.org/index.php/Gender_Equality_in_Brazil" target="_blank">reported</a> that 200,000 women a year are hospitalized for complications of illegal abortion.</p>
<p>The reasons behind riot grrrl&#8217;s popularity in Brazil are even the subject of an <a title="Journals" href="http://journals.lib.washington.edu/index.php/intersections/article/view/9544" target="_blank">academic paper by Calla Hummel</a>, who recognises the political significance and adaptability of this particular bit of shouty youth culture:</p>
<blockquote><p>Brazilian riot grrrl is one of the sites where Western cultural hegemony is being called into question&#8230; As it moves across borders, riot grrrl becomes a form of transnational feminism – and grrrls must address how ideas and material originating in a given locale may resonate, change, or delegitimize ideas and work in another.</p></blockquote>
<p>Gender inequality is a global problem which varies in its expression across different cultural contexts. It&#8217;s not an &#8216;over there&#8217; issue, but in some places it&#8217;s more severe than in others. Similarly, riot grrrl anywhere is awesome, but the courage and kickassness of the grrrls in these bands is pretty inspiring.</p>
<p>As a band member called Isabella quoted by Hummel says:</p>
<blockquote><p>As long as we keep getting letters from the middle of the jungle, from a tiny, three person town in the Amazon, from some girl saying, &#8216;Feminism saved my life, thank you,&#8217; we will keep doing it.</p></blockquote>

					<description><![CDATA[How do you put on a DIY feminist club night? Girl Germs show us how it's done!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li><em>Yet another guest post! We asked Lydia and Laura, the brains behind London feminist club night <strong>Girl Germs</strong>, to give us some tips about how it&#8217;s done. Do you have a guest post brewing in your brain? You know the drill: email us on <a href="mailto:badrepeditors@gmail.com"><strong>badrepeditors@gmail.com</strong></a></em>.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/girlgermslondon" target="_blank"><strong>Girl Germs</strong></a> is our DIY feminist, queer and trans* friendly club night, and soon-to-be record label. We started in 2008, as part of our university’s Feminist Week. We hired out the student union bar, and suddenly we had four bands booked. We had a lot of help from the staff at the union, and our friends in the Feminist Society blew up loads of balloons for us. And on the night, people turned up! To a club night that we arranged!</p>
<p>When we graduated, we decided that we wanted to do it again. We were a bit cautious, though, as suddenly we were dealing with real venues and it was just the two of us (and our friend Tukru, with her <a href="http://www.vampiresushi.co.uk/" target="_blank">amazing zine distro</a>). We put on several nights in Camden with no bands where we’d DJ for hours, sometimes getting our friends to help us out when we got tired. Our little venue was always full, and everybody left tired and sweaty.</p>

<p>But it was during the preparations for <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/12/02/five-things-i-found-at-ladyfest-ten/">Ladyfest Ten</a> that we plucked up the courage to put on another full-scale night with bands. We managed to put on three of our favourite bands and organise DJs, stalls and even cake. We’d somehow pulled it off again! The place was packed, and we were exhausted, but ecstatic.</p>
<p>The plan was to build on the success of that night, but mental health issues and a period of unemployment and geographical separation meant it was impossible. We’re back next month though, and more excited than ever.</p>
<p>We’ve learned a lot through running Girl Germs. But the biggest thing is: running a club night is easy. Most promoters don’t want you to know that, because they don’t want you to try it yourself. We’re poor, unsociable and uncool. We spend a lot of time talking to our cat. If we can do it, so can you.</p>
<h2>You don’t need a lot of money</h2>
<p>We both work really hard in low-paid jobs. We don’t have trust funds, or any disposable income to speak of at all, really. A night can be as expensive or cheap as you make it. There are very few upfront costs, because bands and venues can be paid on the night from your door takings. It’s also kind of a waste to spend loads of money on fancy flyers, because the most effective promotion now happens online through social media. We spend a little money on photocopying beforehand, but that’s about it.</p>
<h2>You don’t need ‘connections’</h2>
<p>To have connections, you’d probably need to network, and who wants to do that? We don’t have a little black book with useful emails in. We just write to bands we like and venues we think might want us, and ask nicely. It’s much easer that way, especially if you’re shy. Hell, we barely have the courage to speak to bands when they’re at Girl Germs ready to play.</p>
<h2>You don’t need technical knowledge</h2>
<p>DJing is easy, and the best way to learn is by doing. We learned on the job, and it never went that badly wrong. As well as that, bands will let you know what they need, and venues will understand their requests. Your job is to be the go-between. If you have any questions, bands and sound people are always happy to answer. That’s their job, after all. Generally venues will have most of the gear, and bands expect to bring extras themselves and sometimes share with other acts on the bill.</p>
<h2>You don’t need to spend oodles of time on it</h2>
<p>You won’t need to give up your day job to give yourself enough time to do this. We have very little free time in the evenings after work, but it’s enough to get things done.</p>
<p>In the lead-up, you’ll mainly be emailing people and drumming up support on Twitter and Facebook. If you have a smartphone, you can do this on the go (or under your desk at work). You might need an evening to write a press release, or an hour or so to set up a Facebook page and event, but it’s all manageable if you’re a little bit organised about it.</p>
<h2>You won’t need to beg venues and bands to give you a chance</h2>
<p>Venues need cub nights, and bands need gigs. People need somewhere to go for a dance on a Saturday night. These people aren’t doing you a favour, and most of them won’t act like they are. Venues have always been helpful and supportive to us, and bands have been excited to play. As long as you let people know what they’re doing and when, you’ll be fine.</p>
<p>So, there it is. Easy, huh?</p>
<p>We’d love more club nights to go to, run by like-minded people. Find your own theme, and give it a go. There’s almost nothing more satisfying than watching a room full of people dancing and knowing that you got them there.</p>
<p>If you want to know anything in more detail, or you have questions, you can email us at <a href="mailto:girlgermsondon@gmail.com"><strong>girlgermsondon@gmail.com</strong></a> and we’ll do our best to help.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the weekend, Viktoriya and I went to a fanzine fair at <a href="http://www.constructiongallery.co.uk/">The Construction Gallery</a>, a pop-up arts space in Tooting. We were excited by this, and not just because we didn&#8217;t have to venture far from home. I&#8217;m really cheered by the huge upswing in arty, crafty, DIY community stuff that&#8217;s happening right now, like the <a href="http://handmadeintooting.wordpress.com/crafty-pint/">Crafty Pint</a> series of making-stuff-inna-pub. It makes me feel connected to things that are going on locally, and I love the mash-up of traditional &#8220;feminine&#8221; pursuits, like <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/09/28/guest-post-craft-is-a-feminist-issue/">sewing</a>, in traditional &#8220;masculine&#8221; environments like the pub. It&#8217;s almost as if people of all genders could get involved. Serious.</p>
<h3>&#8220;I used to write for a &#8216;zine back when there was no internet&#8230;&#8221;</h3>
<p>But to the &#8216;zines. I used to write for a fanzine, back in sixth form, when I was trying to be as cool as the girl who made the fanzine in question, who wanted to be a music journalist and who didn&#8217;t like Kula Shaker so I had to pretend not to like them either (but I did, and I do). I remember getting super excited over the fact that I was holding in my hand something that I had helped to make, and seeing my art in print for the first time. It made me realise that I could actually be creative, that there were things I could physically make outside of the dismal sessions of Art Class where I woefully, grudgingly failed to reproduce any of the techniques of the grand masters. This involved scissors and glue and a photocopier. <em>I could totally do those things!</em> I did pictures for two issues, until teenage bitching meant that no one was talking to anyone and it all got a bit fraught.</p>

<p>So that was my experience. I&#8217;m glad to say that <em>other</em> people are still making fanzines, and that they are varied, beautiful, different and amazing. I spent a tenner on a stack of &#8216;zines and came home giddy with the fact I owned little bits of art, thought and lovely stuff. Counter culture. I was gobsmacked with the array of fanzines on offer and made even happier when I realised how fucking feminist all of it was. And how diverse that feminism felt. All kinds of people were making all kinds of cool, gender-diverse, body-shape positive, politically forward things. Which were funny. And nice to look at.</p>
<p>Here are some of my faves.</p>
<h3>Queer and Feminist &#8216;Zines</h3>
<p>I fell in love with <a href="http://www.creepclub.co.uk/nancy/"><strong>Nancy</strong></a> just from the cover alone, and more so when I read the contents. A series of personal essays, rants and raves on the subject of effeminate gay men and why there is such antagonism towards them both within mainstream AND gay culture. A seriously smart read, which delivers one gay chap&#8217;s take on queer theory sliced through with pics of Lady Gaga and Brian Molko. I particularly enjoyed the list of &#8216;positive femme men&#8217;. <a href="http://www.grassrootsfeminism.net/cms/node/766"><strong>Shape and Situate</strong></a> subtitled itself as <em>Posters of Inspirational European Women</em>, and it did exactly what it said on the cover. A whole bunch of artists had done different pages, in different styles, giving stories and pictures about women as varied as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayaben_Desai">Jayaben Desa</a>i and <a href="http://liztopia.wordpress.com/">Liz Ely</a>, so I now have a whole host of new icons, plus lots of links to new artists and new feminist allies I hadn&#8217;t heard of before. <a href="http://monsteremporium.wordpress.com/publications/layout-1/"><strong>Girls Who Fight</strong></a> &#8211; do NOT google &#8220;girls who fight&#8221;; you will get bad porn &#8211; from Monster Emporium (see the distributors list below) is a good wodge of art, essays, stories, photos and all kinds of feminist goodies. I got all three issues due to being greedy. And I regret nothing. Another of my stellar buys was <a href="http://www.missmoti.com/Miss_Moti/Welcome.html"><strong>Miss Moti</strong></a> by artist <a href="http://kripakreations.com/Home.html">Kripa Joshi</a>. A stunning and high quality comic, standing out from its photocopied sisters. The rich, lush artwork details the daydream life of Miss Moti:</p>
<blockquote><p>Pronounced with a regular T this Nepali word means</p>
<p>A Plump Woman</p>
<p>But spoken with a softer T it means</p>
<p>A Pearl</p></blockquote>
<p>I really liked the curvy, sexy heroine &#8211; depicted on the cover in a seashell like Venus, but clothed in a polka dot dress. The simple storylines unfolded into wonderful fantasies: a bit of cotton candy becomes a pink cloud landscape where she sculpts her own David; a piece of apple grows into a new Eden complete with Adam. This was a real change from the lycra-clad hardbodies and explosion-tasms of the usual suspect superheroines I&#8217;ve become so used to seeing. This comic focused on her desires, rather than using her as a vehicle for the (assumed straight male) reader.</p>
<h3>Distributors and Indie Publishers</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.vampiresushi.co.uk/"><strong>Vampire Sushi</strong></a> are &#8216;zine distributors, so they&#8217;ve got their fingers in lots of pies. They specialise in perzines<sup><a href="/2012/02/29/feminist-fanzine-fest/#footnote_0_10035" id="identifier_0_10035" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" Nope, I didn&rsquo;t know either. But Wiki does. Woo! ">1</a></sup>, art &#8216;zines, queer &#8216;zines, food &#8216;zines and feminist &#8216;zines. Which is pretty much all your &#8216;zine food groups.  Similarly, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/96763473106/"><strong>Monster Emporium Press</strong></a> have &#8216;zines and artbooks, as well as being monster-themed, which we at BadRep Towers are generally in favour of. <a href="http://otherasias.webnode.com/core-team/"><strong>Other Asias</strong></a> bring together artists whose work challenges misrepresentations and generalisations of &#8220;The East&#8221;. One of their cute mini &#8216;zines comes with a teabag inside, which meant that all my &#8216;zines now have a delicious scent to them. Finally, <a href="http://www.honestpublishing.com/"><strong>Honest Publishing</strong></a> are an independent publisher based in SW London, celebrating authors with unique, alternative voices.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re in East London on Sunday, you should totally swing by the <a href="http://www.londonzinesymposium.org.uk/">Zine Symposium.</a> For Hodge will be in attendance armed with a selection of Alphabet goodies, including a very few <strong>ALPHABET POSTERS</strong>.</p>
<p>If you missed the first run (which you probably did, as there were only <strong>ten</strong> and only <strong>one </strong>actually went on public sale) these are currently rarer than tyrannosaurus eggs, and there&#8217;s no guarantee there will be another run in the near future. For the Hodge thy Hodge is a jealous Hodge, and can&#8217;t be dashing to the print shop every five minutes.</p>

<p>Affordable, fun and an opportunity to expose Hodge&#8217;s true identity. Plus loads of cool zines and fun people. What&#8217;s not to like?</p>
<p>Check her out at the bereavement tape table.</p>
<p>&#8230;totally just realised this says &#8216;by hodge&#8217; at the top. i don&#8217;t talk about myself in the third person on a regular basis.</p>
