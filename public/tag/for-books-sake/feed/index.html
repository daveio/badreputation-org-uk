<p>You have been emailing us! Demanding to know where the linkposts have gone! AND RIGHTLY SO. </p>
<ul>
<li> So, to kick off, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=197363420301422&#038;notif_t=event_photo_change">Slutwalk London comes to the capital!</a> And the date has been changed to <strong>June 11th</strong>! Previously on Found Feminism when it marched through Birmingham, now it&#8217;s blown up majorly. Oars of all colours have been stuck in. Us? We&#8217;ll be there. If you spot us (we&#8217;re contemplating a banner), come say hello. We&#8217;re a friendly bunch, promise. </li>
<li>Also on June the 11th, <a href="http://ladyfestessex.wordpress.com/">Ladyfest Essex</a> &#8211; a one day celebration of women and creativity, with the proceeds going to Refuge.  Go to Slutwalk, and then head out to Southend!</li>

<li><a href="http://treasuryislands.wordpress.com/">TreasuryIslands</a> is a badass blog. (You will already know this if you were reading us a couple of days ago, as writer Libby was guestposting. Scroll down. Read that too. It&#8217;s Friday.) Particular favourites: <a href="http://treasuryislands.wordpress.com/2011/04/22/vampire-fiction-in-the-twilight-generation/">Libby versus teen vampire fiction</a> and the posts on feminist-friendly picture books aimed at boys and at girls.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Being the first linkpost of 2011!</p>
<ul>
<li>Our Viktoriya found this on LiveJournal: <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/iconnaissances/32287.html"><strong>Fun picspam post of non-English speaking lead cinematic female characters</strong></a>.  Gave us some ideas for the collective DVD wishlist. Vik adds: <em>&#8220;Although I&#8217;m surprised that there is no Isabelle Adjani in La Reine Margot, no Franka Potente in Run Lola Run, no Sophie Marceau in Les femmes de l&#8217;omre/Female Agents, and no Noomi Rapace in Girl with a Dragon Tattoo. (I also think that Lina Leandersson should qualify in Let the Right One In.) And what about the scary, scary Yeong-ae Lee in Lady Vengeance, or Li Gong in Red Sorghum (with bonus stealth!genocide)?&#8221;</em> Good points all. To the sale at play.com, at once!</li>
<li><em>&#8220;We are FiG.  We stand for Feminism in General, a new network who embrace feminists from all walks of life, with a view to discussing anything relating to women’s issues and feminism&#8230; We are an all inclusive feminist collective, which means we welcome trans feminists, queer feminists, male feminists, feminists of all genders, races, classes and ages.&#8221;</em>
<p>Sounds good to us &#8211; and they&#8217;ve just gotten started, so go check &#8217;em out: <a href="https://figheads.wordpress.com/"><strong>Feminism in General</strong></a>.</li>
<li><em>&#8220;How would you define normal? Is it when you wear shoes on your feet at the mall or eat toast for breakfast? Is it when you’re female and feel like a woman? What happens when you go somewhere else and they don’t even have shoes or toast, or when you’re in a group of people who are female and don’t feel at all like women?</em> <strong>What’s Normal Anyway</strong> <em>is a webcomic that discusses the trans male experience and aims to add another voice representing a part of the wide spectrum of human diversity. And be funny about it too.&#8221;</em> <a href="http://whatsnormalanyway.net/">It&#8217;s charmingly drawn and well worth a read. </a></li>
<li><em>&#8220;Whether or not your story includes the Bechdel scene says absolutely nothing about whether it’s sexist or not. The measure of sexism is whether your story denies women the opportunity to participate in it.&#8221;</em> Hathor Legacy issues a wake-up call with <strong><a href="http://thehathorlegacy.com/the-bechdel-test-its-not-about-passing/">The Bechdel Test: It&#8217;s Not About Passing</a> </strong>.</li>
<li>Tinchy Stryder&#8217;s <strong>Game Over</strong> gets a Female Takeover courtesy of a collective of female MCs after a rallying cry, issued on Twitter, brought them together. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/manchester/hi/people_and_places/music/newsid_9285000/9285555.stm">BBC article here</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxX3oqQ1Y1I&#038;feature=related">Radio 1Xtra discussion here</a>&#8230; and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ev458ENOqZY"><strong>check the track out here</strong></a>. (For comparison, here&#8217;s the much-vaunted <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3jMmIZDQv0">all-male original remix</a>.) Currently on regular rotation here at BR towers, the track itself makes the editor do a dangerously over-energised dance &#8211; listen to the interview; their energy and drive is infectious.</li>
<li><em>&#8220;Summing up what feminism means has always been a tricky business. Whilst there are formal definitions to be found, ultimately the concept is a fluid one: made real, developed and adapted by those that subscribe to it. So what does it actually mean for a publishing house to be steered by its feminist guiding principles?&#8221;</em> <a href="http://forbookssake.net/2010/12/06/tara-books/">India-based publishing house <strong>Tara Books</strong> tell For Books&#8217; Sake how they do it here.</a></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FINALLY.  It&#8217;s a fortnight late, but I couldn&#8217;t <em>not</em> post about <a href="http://ladyfestten.com/"><strong>Ladyfest Ten</strong></a>.  Rather than reviewing the whole event  &#8211; there&#8217;s quite a few reviews floating around by now &#8211; I thought I&#8217;d just spotlight the best picks from my rucksack-hoard of discoveries.</p>
<p>For those for whom this blog is a First Foray into feminist websites, what is a Ladyfest? Well, they happen worldwide &#8211; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladyfest">here&#8217;s Wikipedia&#8217;s entry</a>.  Succinctly, they&#8217;re community-based arts and culture festivals focussed on women creating culture and campaigning for social change.  The first one was in 2000 in the US; today Ladyfests go on all over the world. This one, my first, was the decade-marker!</p>
<p>Sarah J, Jenni and I pitched up on the Saturday afternoon with &#8220;Rest of the Fest&#8221; tix.  I went for a wander in the stalls of the Lady Garden (you read that correctly).  Hence, without further ado:</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">FIVE THINGS I FOUND AT LADYFEST</h3>

<h3>1. FAT QUARTER MAGAZINE</h3>
<p>My friends, this thing is seriously badass. Give it your time. You won&#8217;t be disappointed.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>WHAT IS IT? </strong>Zines and self-produced magazines are a rich tradition in feminism, and they all come out to play for festivals. This was no exception &#8211; some doing the old school riot grrrl photocopied look, and some glossier efforts. This one, firmly in the latter category, really stood out.  Only two issues in since its 2009 inception, it&#8217;s <em>beautifully</em> designed, full colour, and fun. I swear, if BadRep was a print magazine, we&#8217;d be aspiring to be like this.</li>
<li><strong>WHY SHOULD I PAY ATTENTION? </strong>BECAUSE<strong>. </strong>LOOK AT IT. YOU WILL SEE WHY. Someone I spotted on the BadRep Twitter feed pronounced them the rightful heirs to the gap left by <a href="http://www.subtextmagazine.co.uk/">Subtext</a>, and I reckon they weren&#8217;t wrong.</li>
<li><strong>WHERE CAN I GET MORE? </strong>There&#8217;s <strong><a href="http://www.fat-quarter.co.uk/">a website here</a></strong> ,  they&#8217;re <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Fat-Quarter/162234649334">on Facebook here</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/KatieFQ">editor Katie&#8217;s tweeti</a><a href="http://twitter.com/KatieFQ">ng here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<div id="attachment_1397" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/002-e1290962385341.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1397" data-attachment-id="1397" data-permalink="/2010/12/02/five-things-i-found-at-ladyfest-ten/attachment/002/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/002-e1290962385341.jpg?fit=2592%2C1936&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="2592,1936" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="inside spread" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/002-e1290962385341.jpg?fit=300%2C224&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/002-e1290962385341.jpg?fit=1024%2C764&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-1397" title="inside spread" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/002-e1290962385341-300x224.jpg?resize=300%2C224" alt="Inside spread from Fat Quarter issue 1, an article on women in comics called " width="300" height="224" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/002-e1290962385341.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/002-e1290962385341.jpg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/002-e1290962385341.jpg?w=401&amp;ssl=1 401w, https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/002-e1290962385341.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1397" class="wp-caption-text">FQ1 inside spread (I picked the comics page to show off.

<h3>2. FOR BOOK&#8217;S SAKE</h3>
<p>Like reading? Interested in feminism? You&#8217;re welcome.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>WHAT IS IT? </strong>In their own words, <strong><a href="http://forbookssake.net/">For Books’ Sake</a> </strong>is <em>an intelligent but irreverent  website featuring books by and for independent women, including news,  reviews, features and interviews. Focusing mainly on female authors  (both upcoming and established), we review classic and modern books  across both fiction and non-fiction. </em>What really brought the coolness of this project home to me, though, was the moment I rounded a corner at Ladyfest and found myself standing smack bang in front of FBS writer <a href="http://forbookssake.net/2010/06/23/literary-loves-the-travelling-suitcase-library/">Jess Haigh&#8217;s Travelling Suitcase Library</a>, which is, essentially, a kind of Sisterhood of the Travelling Books &#8211; she hosts pop-up library sessions where the curious, interested and bookloving can meet, swap books, simply take books away (no membership necessary &#8211; it&#8217;s all done on trust), or talk books.</li>
<li><strong>WHY SHOULD I PAY ATTENTION? </strong> Because it&#8217;s a heartwarming project with serious soul, an open-arms approach to all sorts of writing from Penguin Classics to teen fiction, and an ethos of bonding people through books.  Over the desk, Jess spotted me covertly eyeing Marilyn French&#8217;s <strong>The Women&#8217;s Room</strong> in a &#8220;man, I really should read that at some point&#8221; way, smiled, and said, &#8220;That book right there?  The reason I became a feminist&#8221;. <em>That </em>caught my attention. Before long, <strong>Women&#8217;s Room</strong> and I were heading home together.  Cheers!</li>
<li><strong>WHERE CAN I GET MORE?</strong> See above, or catch them <strong><a href="http://twitter.com/forbookssake">on Twitter</a></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. PAMFLET</h3>
<p>So what if everybody&#8217;s already heard of this zine. I am <em>fashionably</em> late to the party and you can all deal with it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>WHAT IS IT? </strong>I didn&#8217;t want to write a post about the stalls of Ladyfest without including one full-on, photocopied, more old school-stylin&#8217; zine. That zine &#8211; and choosing was hard &#8211; is <strong>Pamflet</strong>, who are a &#8220;<em>post-everything london girl-zine made by anna-marie, phoebe &amp; nick // photocopied pink n black since 2005</em>&#8220;.</li>
<li><strong>WHY SHOULD I PAY ATTENTION? </strong> Because it&#8217;s good to have zines in your life.  It&#8217;s good to put heart into your causes, hobbies, fandoms, to make your own soapboxes out of sticky tape, photocopier drums and internet. It&#8217;s the same vein of creativity-meets-sharing that leads people to make mixtapes (and if there&#8217;s not a post by me on the sheer joy of mixtaping at <em>some </em>point in the life of this blog, I&#8217;m Anne Widdecombe).</li>

<h3>4. SHE MAKES WAR</h3>
<p>Well, this one&#8217;s a bit of a cheat.  You&#8217;ll have noted that we didn&#8217;t actually have tickets to the musical side of Ladyfest, BUT CONSIDER THIS PLUG MY ATONEMENT, for <strong>She Makes War</strong>, one of the acts that played, is awesome. And I&#8217;m making some noise about her here because while she wasn&#8217;t on a stall, I <em>was</em> blurting about her to Jenni while we were <em>browsing</em> the stalls, and besides, the Ladyfest buzz has since pushed me to buy her album, and that is what we blog editors call A TENUOUS LINK AND THEREFORE VIABLE. <em>Yes.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>WHAT IS IT? </strong>Great music.</li>
<li><strong>WHY SHOULD I PAY ATTENTION? </strong>She&#8217;s already sailing a soupstream of soundbites like  &#8220;special brand of gloom punk-pop&#8221;, &#8220;grimy angst-pop&#8221;, and so on, and you  know why that is, guys? It&#8217;s because she&#8217;s REALLY GOOD. Fans of PJ Harvey, Melissa Auf der Maur et al should particularly consider applying, but <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq7w9IXlBGM&amp;feature=player_embedded">I&#8217;ll just leave this taster-trailer-thinger here.</a></li>

<h3>5. EDUCATION FOR CHOICE</h3>
<p>One of the few talks all three of us made it to, so I&#8217;m rounding this off with their call to action.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>WHAT IS IT? </strong>&#8220;<em>The only UK-based educational charity dedicated to enabling young people to make informed choices about pregnancy and abortion.</em>&#8220;</li>
<li><strong>WHY SHOULD I PAY ATTENTION? </strong>Because the amount of bogus &#8220;unbiased information on abortion&#8221; services out there is growing like mould in a petri, along with that worrying US trend for <a href="http://www.salon.com/life/broadsheet/2010/10/25/abortion/index.html">aggressive pickets like this</a>. Sarah C tweeted just as we left the talk to say that she&#8217;d passed one herself whilst out in central London. Do not want.</li>
