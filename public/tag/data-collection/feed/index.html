										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear darling BadRep readers, I&#8217;m not happy.  Let me avail your face of the reason why.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/046.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="4036" data-permalink="/2011/03/11/the-census-says-i-dont-exist/attachment/046/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/046.jpg?fit=2592%2C1936&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="2592,1936" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.8&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;iPhone 4&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1299696929&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;3.85&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.066666666666667&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="census" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/046.jpg?fit=300%2C224&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/046.jpg?fit=1024%2C764&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4036" title="census" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/046-300x224.jpg?resize=300%2C224" alt="photo of the &quot;what is your sex?&quot; question on the purple-coloured paper census questionnaire" width="300" height="224" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/046.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/046.jpg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/046.jpg?w=401&amp;ssl=1 401w, https://i2.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/046.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>If you live in Britain, you&#8217;ll have noticed that you&#8217;ve had a census  posted to you.   As you should all be aware (but don&#8217;t worry if you&#8217;re  not &#8211; I didn&#8217;t know about it until this year!) <a href="http://www.census.gov.uk/">the census </a>takes  stock of all the citizens of the British Isles, their means, whats and  wherefores, and then the government looks at it and goes, &#8220;Hmm! Based on  the fact that we have <em>this</em> many of <em>these</em> people, we&#8217;ll spend our money <em>this</em> way.&#8221;</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s actually quite important that the data gathered is accurate.</p>
<p>Imagine my disgust, then, when I turned to page whatever-it-is where it asked me:</p>
<p><strong>What is your sex?</strong><br />
<strong>[ ] Male  [ ] Female</strong></p>
<p>You read that right.   There&#8217;s <em>just</em> the box to state your &#8220;sex&#8221;, and there&#8217;s only two boxes, and there&#8217;s no mention whatsoever of gender anywhere.</p>
<p>Now, anyone capable of thought will realise that <strong>sex is distinct and non-prescriptive of gender, and gender is not binary. </strong> Indeed, <strong>neither are binary</strong>.  For the census to merely ask the (binary) &#8220;sex&#8221; of the British people is to  erase the identities of the numerous trans* and Intersex Brits.   What  the fuck are we meant to put?   Do we tick both?   Do we add another box?    Do we just shun the whole thing altogether?   If there&#8217;s a define-own  space for religion, why not for gender?</p>
<p>How are we ever meant to  glean accurate data on how many trans* and Intersex people we have  living here in the British Isles if there&#8217;s no room for them on the  bloody census?!</p>
<p>Therefore, I have the following favour to ask of you: <strong>if  you are living in Britain, have access to a telephone and some excess  bile going, give the census <a href="http://2011.census.gov.uk/index.php?content_id=135">helpline</a> a call and complain.</strong> If no-one  speaks up about this, they will never know.   And if we can&#8217;t fix 2011&#8217;s  census, it may well be fixed next time from our shouting this time  around.</p>
<p><strong>Edited to add: </strong>I&#8217;ve been informed that there&#8217;s a Facebook event to pass around <a href="http://www.facebook.com/#!/event.php?eid=130571420348024">right here</a>, if you&#8217;re Facebookly-inclined, and a friend of mine, who has actually bled some sense from the person they were on the phone to, has reported that they really don&#8217;t know how to handle this, and that <strong>if you tick both &#8220;male&#8221; and &#8220;female&#8221;, you CANNOT be fined for not providing information</strong>, although you may get a phone call to check the data and see how it can be incorporated.  Result!  For best results, though, combine both &#8211; tick both boxes <em>and</em> call them to vent your spleen.  The T is not silent, people.</p>
