<p>In February 2010, Hannah Forman (under the pen name Hannah Neurotica) began <a href="http://www.womeninhorrormonth.com/"><strong>Women in Horror Recognition Month</strong></a> as a way to celebrate women&#8217;s contribution to the horror industry.</p>
<p>She began the campaign out of frustration at the lack of coverage of women working in horror media, and received a terrific response to the initiative. People used social media and blogging platforms to discuss their favourite women creators throughout the month of February, and aided the conversation about horror and women&#8217;s participation in it. It&#8217;s a fine example of how online communities can be harnessed to a positive effect. It&#8217;s become an annual event since then.</p>
<p>In the past four years there&#8217;s been a discernable increase of attention given to women&#8217;s contributions across the creative spectrum. This has not been given freely. It&#8217;s come about because women and men have asked to see a more equal representation of work by creators they enjoy. It&#8217;s because of campaigns liked Women in Horror Recognition Month that some media sources have finally noticed there <em>are</em> women in the industry, and that many of them have been around for a long time.</p>
<p>Hopefully there will come a time when such an initiative is redundant, but since the <a href="http://www.vidaweb.org/the-2011-count">Vida statistics</a> on the participation and coverage of women&#8217;s work in many media sources remains low, that time is not upon us yet.</p>
<p>Two years ago, Bad Reputation asked me to write an article called <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/03/01/women-in-horror-five-recommended-writers/"><strong>Women in Horror: Five Recommended Writers</strong></a>, and this year I&#8217;m singling out the work of women who create across horror media.</p>

She&#8217;s been making a reputation for herself in horror circles since her stories began to be published, from 2005 onwards. Her work has been printed and reprinted in many prestigious anthologies.</p>
<p>She writes difficult, fascinating characters coping with disturbing situations. Some of her stories are unashamedly erotic in a way that honestly reflects the terrible fixations of desire.</p>
<p>Her first short story collection, <strong>Engines of Desire: Tales of Love &amp; Other Horrors</strong>, was published by <a href="http://www.lethepressbooks.com/">Lethe Press</a> in 2011 and contains ten of her stories. It received rave reviews, and was nominated for a Shirley Jackson Award for Best Collection. It announced the arrival of an original talent, and one fans of horror fiction should watch.</p>
<h2>2. Jen and Sylvia Soska &#8211; Screenwriters, Directors, Actors, Producers</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.twistedtwinsproductions.net" target="_blank">Jen &amp; Slyvia Soska</a> are Canadian identical twins, long fans of horror, and have trained in martial arts and stunt work. Their first short film was a trailer for a movie, <a href="http://www.deadhookerinatrunk.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Dead Hooker in a Trunk</strong></a>, which they then made as their début film. They wrote, produced, directed, and acted in the movie, and it gained a lot of attention on the horror film festival circuit.</p>

<p>It was last year&#8217;s movie, <a href="http://www.twistedtwinsproductions.net/americanmary.htm" target="_blank"><strong>American Mary</strong></a>, which showed the development of the sisters&#8217; work. Once again they wrote, directed, and appeared in it. It stars Katharine Isabelle (<strong>Ginger Snaps</strong>) as Mary Mason, a broke medical student who changes her career after a traumatic experience, and puts her knowledge of physiology to use by doing extreme body modifications.</p>
<p>The film won five awards at Screamfest last year, including Best Picture and Best Director.</p>
<p>Over the years they&#8217;ve demonstrated determination, creative progression, and ambition, and I&#8217;m looking forward to what they will do next.</p>
<h2>3. Hannah Berry &#8211; Comic Book Writer and Artist</h2>
<p><a href="http://hannahberry.co.uk/" target="_blank">Hannah Berry</a> began drawing from a young age, inspired by comics like <strong>Calvin and Hobbs</strong>, and French <em>bande dessinée</em>. She completed a Degree in Illustration at the University of Brighton, and during that time began work on her first graphic novel, <a href="http://www.randomhouse.co.uk/editions/9780224077903" target="_blank"><strong>Britten and Brülightly</strong></a>.</p>

It was universally lauded, and was translated into many languages.</p>
<p>The French edition was chosen for the Official Selection of the prestigious Angoulême International Comics Festival in France in 2010. While not overtly a horror story, the dark, noir atmosphere is resonant with supernatural mystery tales.</p>
<p>She was the Booktrust Writer in Residence in 2012, and has been an instructor on the Arvon Foundation’s Graphic Novel Writing course several times.</p>
<p>Her latest graphic novel is <a href="http://forbiddenplanet.co.uk/blog/2012/directors-commentary-hannah-berry-talks-adamtine/" target="_blank"><strong>Adamtine</strong></a>, an eerie story about a late night train journey that stalls and brings its passengers on an altogether unexpected journey. Its atmospheric art and complicated narrative prove that Hannah has the chops for slow-burn supernatural stories.</p>
<p>A free preview of <strong>Adamtine</strong> can be <a href="http://hannahberry.co.uk/wpcontent/adamtinedload/ADAMTINE_sample.pdf">downloaded from her website</a>.</p>

<a href="http://alicelowe.net" target="_blank">Alice Lowe</a> attended Cambridge, and started her career co-devising and performing in small fringe shows. She appeared in <strong>Garth Marenghi&#8217;s Fright Knight</strong> in 2000 at the Edinburgh Festival. The show was nominated for the Perrier Award, and Alice won it the following year for her performance in the sequel, <strong>Garth Marenghi&#8217;s Netherhead</strong>. The show was then turned into a Channel 4 comedy, <a href="http://www.channel4.com/programmes/garth-marenghis-darkplace" target="_blank"><strong>Garth Marenghi&#8217;s Darkplace</strong></a>. Alice has also appeared in such television shows as <strong>The Mighty Boosh</strong>, <strong>Little Britain</strong>, and <strong>The IT Crowd</strong>.</p>
<p>She went back to Edinburgh Festival in 2005 with her own Kate-Bush inspired prog-rock spoof, <strong>Moonjourney</strong>, co-wrote and starred in Channel 4&#8217;s <strong>Orcadia</strong>, and was part of E4&#8217;s sketch show <strong>Beehive</strong>.</p>
<p>In 2010 she and director Jacqueline Wright set up Jackal Films to challenge themselves to create a short film every month, <a href="http://www.jackalfilms.co.uk/calendar/">which they did</a>. She also created <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01l22pk" target="_blank"><strong>Alice&#8217;s Wunderland</strong></a>, a<br />
comedy sketch show for BBC Radio 4.</p>
<p>Alice&#8217;s work focuses on comedy, but there are often dark veins of horror threaded throughout her material. A case in point is the film <strong>Sightseers</strong>, which was released in November 2012. She co-wrote it with Steve Oram, with some material by Amy Jump, and co-stars in the film with Oram. The film is a black comedy about a couple who go on holiday in a caravan and get up to a bit of murder along the way.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re not familiar with these women&#8217;s work, I encourage you to seek it out. I should note that this is a personal pick: there are many other talented women horror creators out there.</p>

You&#8217;ve studied Anglo-Irish supernatural fiction at university, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhartach">Abhartach</a> appears in <em>Róisín Dubh</em> and the ghost of Oscar Wilde turns up in your other comics project, <em>Jennifer Wilde</em>. Which other myths or historical figures can we expect to turn up in <em>Róisín Dubh</em>,  and do you have any favourite people, legends or mythological monsters from Irish history and folklore?</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Robert Curley at Atomic Diner comics pitched the core idea of <strong>Róisín Dubh</strong> to me and told me about the existing myth around Abhartach. I did what I  always do: research. I thought a great deal about the time period, the story of Abhartach, Róisín herself and her situation.</p>
<p>For me, I need to find what I think of a &#8216;mythic resonance&#8217; in a story that I&#8217;m trying to create. Making a character swing a sword and lop off a head is easy: making a story with horror and fantasy elements feel like it could possibly be real requires that it resemble mythology itself.</p>
<p>So, I went back to my books on Irish mythology &#8211; of which I have many  &#8211; and kept reading until elements connected with what I already had in  my head about the story. I added a few Irish gods into the mix, a  companion character and a couple of magical items. I widened the canvas. And I gave Róisín a very painful thing to do, which happens in issue 2 and is something that will haunt her forever. </p>
<p>Equally, I thought a lot about Abhartach. I don&#8217;t like simplistic villains. I added to his backstory and made him into a person who does unpleasant things, but who has motivations and reasons for his view of the world. Thankfully, Rob was very receptive to me bringing all this to the characters and the story!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been reading mythological stories from all cultures since childhood. One story that holds a lot of fascination for me is &#8216;the descent into the underworld&#8217;. There is a variation on that in issue 1 of <strong>Róisín Dubh</strong> &#8211; though I&#8217;m not always aware of every element like this that I&#8217;m tapping into when I write the story. Sometimes it doesn&#8217;t become obvious until later.</p>
<p>Ultimately, when writing I try to feed my subconscious to stuffing point with lots of influences and then allow it to serve me up suggestions as I&#8217;m going on. I trust it to give me the right element at the right time. Then, some time afterwards, I marvel at how it all came together. That&#8217;s when it&#8217;s really doing its job.</p>
<p>But I have days when it gives me nothing and I soldier on anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Creating a comic book in this way, with a separate writer  and artist, is a collaborative process, and one that tends to be favoured by most American and European publishers. How did this process work for you, how much input did the artists have, and what was it like seeing your character come to life in their hands?</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;The collaborative element is what I enjoy the most. I can&#8217;t tell you how amazing it is to see the words I&#8217;ve written translated into images. Mostly, it&#8217;s better than I hoped.  Sometimes we&#8217;ll discuss how a certain panel is working and ask for changes.</p>
<p>No one is going to draw the Róisín in my head unless I do &#8211; so I have  to allow the artists to bring their version of her to the page.  A successful comic book collaboration &#8211; in my experience &#8211; is about respecting the strengths each person brings to the project. The writer understands story dynamics and the artist knows visual storytelling. You have to learn to depend on the other person&#8217;s knowledge and experience to guide changes in the comic book.</p>
<p>Also, you have to be open to seeing things from a different perspective, and accepting change. I&#8217;m always happy when the artist makes suggestions that are innovative and work better than my original concept.  We&#8217;re all pulling together for the same goal: to create a comic book people will enjoy.&#8221;</p>

You&#8217;re a busy woman! Why don&#8217;t you tell  us a bit more about the projects you&#8217;re working on at the moment besides <em>Róisín Dubh</em>?</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://jenniferwildecomic.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Jennifer Wilde</strong></a> is a fun project. Again, Robert Curley came to me with the core idea, and I went off and did my research &#8211; and that was just brilliant. The 1920s was an amazing era of change: social, economic, and cultural. The story is lighter, and more in the detective genre &#8211; albeit with a  supernatural element.  Jennifer is a French artist who &#8211; through personal  tragedy &#8211; becomes embroiled in a mystery that takes her from France, to England and finally to Ireland &#8211; all helped by the ghost of Oscar Wilde.</p>
<p>Writing Wilde is the most intimidating aspect of the project. I&#8217;ve done a lot of research on him, and he was a brilliant, complex man, but not always wonderful. I try to be respectful of who he was and to bring as much of that to the project as possible.</p>
<p>Most of the art is complete on issue 1, and it should be out in about six weeks. Our artist Stephen Downey has done a fantastic job.  I&#8217;m currently working on the scripts for issue 2 and 3. Issue 2 of <strong>Róisín Dubh</strong> is in the editing stage at the moment, so that should be good to go soon enough.</p>
<p>I usually have other projects in the sidelines, in various stages of  completion: non-fiction, screenplays short stories, poetry, a novel. I even have an idea for a comic book strip, which I would draw as well as write. These projects go up and down in priority depending on deadlines.</p>
<p>All things going well, I&#8217;ll probably write another volume of <strong>Róisín Dubh</strong> and <strong>Jennifer Wilde</strong> for <a href="http://www.atomicdiner.com/">Atomic Diner</a>. I&#8217;d also like to create and write my own comic book series. I have several stories in development.</p>
<p>As well as this I have my job with the Irish Playwrights&#8217; and Screenwriters&#8217; Guild as their blogger and website-wrangler.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s good to be busy!&#8221;</p>
