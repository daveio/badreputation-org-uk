<p>If you&#8217;re in East London on Sunday, you should totally swing by the <a href="http://www.londonzinesymposium.org.uk/">Zine Symposium.</a> For Hodge will be in attendance armed with a selection of Alphabet goodies, including a very few <strong>ALPHABET POSTERS</strong>.</p>
<p>If you missed the first run (which you probably did, as there were only <strong>ten</strong> and only <strong>one </strong>actually went on public sale) these are currently rarer than tyrannosaurus eggs, and there&#8217;s no guarantee there will be another run in the near future. For the Hodge thy Hodge is a jealous Hodge, and can&#8217;t be dashing to the print shop every five minutes.</p>

<p>Affordable, fun and an opportunity to expose Hodge&#8217;s true identity. Plus loads of cool zines and fun people. What&#8217;s not to like?</p>
<p>Check her out at the bereavement tape table.</p>
<p>&#8230;totally just realised this says &#8216;by hodge&#8217; at the top. i don&#8217;t talk about myself in the third person on a regular basis.</p>
