<h3>Starry Starry Night</h3>
<p>All together now: THE LAST ALPHABET POST EVER. And it&#8217;s a word with one of the longest definitions I&#8217;ve yet come across: <em>zone</em>, first cited in 1500, from the Latin <em>zona </em>and the Greek <em>zone</em>, which originally means &#8216;girdle&#8217;.</p>
<div id="attachment_3045" style="width: 226px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Cranach-venus.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3045" data-attachment-id="3045" data-permalink="/2011/04/18/an-alphabet-of-feminism-26-z-is-for-zone/cranach-venus/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Cranach-venus.jpg?fit=1000%2C2280&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1000,2280" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Venus and Cupid" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Cranach-venus.jpg?fit=131%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Cranach-venus.jpg?fit=449%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-3045   " src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Cranach-venus.jpg?resize=216%2C493" alt="Venus naked except for a girdle and some necklaces, by Lucas Cranach the Younger c.1540" width="216" height="493" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Cranach-venus.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Cranach-venus.jpg?w=131&amp;ssl=1 131w, https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Cranach-venus.jpg?w=449&amp;ssl=1 449w" sizes="(max-width: 216px) 100vw, 216px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-3045" class="wp-caption-text">Blame him. He stole my clothes. Venus and her cestus, Lucas Cranach the Younger (1540s)</p></div>
<p>Its complexity is mainly owing to the range of disciplines that have claimed it for their own; these include astrology, astronomy, physical geography, mathematics, poetry, and crystallography. Its immediate practical meaning is geographical: &#8216;Each of the five &#8216;belts&#8217; or encircling regions, differing in climate, into which the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn and the Arctic and Antarctic circles divide the surface of the earth&#8217; – that is, &#8216;the <em>torrid</em> (burning) zone between the tropics, the (north and south) <em>temperate zones </em>extending from the tropics to the polar circles, and the <em>frigid </em>(frozen) zones<em> </em>(arctic and antarctic) within the polar circles&#8217;.</p>
<p>A <em>zone</em>, then, is a &#8216;belt&#8217; that marks out space, enclosing and dividing at once, as reflected in its vaguer sense from 1559 as &#8216;any region extending round the earth and comprised between definite limits&#8217;, where it is also applied to &#8216;a similar region in the heavens or on the surface of a planet&#8217;.</p>
<p>Of course, the Ancient Egyptians gave the practical sky-based role of <em>zoning </em>to a woman –<em> Nut</em>, the goddess of the sky, married to the earth god Geb (an unusual gendering). Nut is depicted throughout Egyptian art as a naked woman arched over the earth, balancing on her fingertips and tiptoes, and often covered in stars, from which position she protects the sun god Ra, and the earth below – a <em>zone </em>in its fourth sense (from 1591), as &#8216;a circumscribing or enclosing ring, band, or line&#8217;. Whence it is but a short step to 1608&#8217;s contribution to the party, <em>zone</em> as &#8216;a girdle or belt, as part of a dress&#8217; (chiefly &#8216;poetical&#8217;), which is really the only literal use for the word: before the word&#8217;s adoption into English, Ancient Greek women wore a &#8216;<em>zona</em>&#8216; under their clothes to accentuate the figure.<br />
<BR></BR></p>
<h3>Alas! My Girdle!</h3>
<p>So we end where we began: with an <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/10/04/an-alphabet-of-femininism-1-a-is-for-amazon/">extra-snazzy belt</a>. Women&#8217;s girdles have a long and varied history going back to the <em><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cestus">cestus</a> </em>or &#8216;Belt of Venus&#8217;, an ill-judged wedding present to the Goddess of Love from her husband Hephaestus which rendered her irresistible to men (and, appropriately, endures on as an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_of_Venus">astronomy term</a>). Martial refers to the <em>cestus </em>in his Epigrams as &#8216;a cincture that kindled love in Jupiter&#8217; (planetary theme ftw), and clearly considered it quite hot stuff himself, since it was &#8216;&#8230;still warm from Venus&#8217; fire&#8217;.</p>
<p>The Medieval West was not to be left behind in all this sexy-talk: no right-thinking female of the thirteen-hundreds considered herself fully sexed-up without a <em>gipon</em>, a type of corset designed to flatten the breasts and emphasise the stomach. And in case this proved insufficient, she might also pad her belly out for extra effect – well-rounded bellies <a href="http://cgfa.acropolisinc.com/eyck/eyck6.jpg">appear</a> <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Les_Tres_Riches_Heures_du_duc_de_Berry_avril_detail.jpg">again</a> and <a href="http://storage.canalblog.com/15/58/119589/34529891.jpg">again</a> in contemporary art – and, as with the Cranach Venus (above), a decorative <em>zone </em>was the perfect way to emphasise its shape, making this a garment no less sexually charged in the 1340s than the <a href="http://www.girdlezone.org/">1940s</a> (when, of course, its job was to hold the belly <em>in</em>). Like a <em>garter</em>, then, a <em>girdle </em>could serve as a fetishistic focal point for erotic (and indeed erogenous) <em>zones</em>, marking them out and keeping them restrained at the same time.</p>

<p>The Dictionary seems to have picked up something of this atmospheric heat itself, and brings us all back to earth by citing for this sense of the word Francis Quarles&#8217; <strong>Emblem VIII</strong> (&#8216;Shall these coarse hands untie / The sacred zone of thy virginity?&#8217; (1635)). Neatly, this citation highlights the flip-side of <em>zone</em>&#8216;s erotic focus – the Roman marriage ceremony famously culminated in the groom untying his wife&#8217;s girdle (enduring into the thigh-rubbing Latin slang phrase &#8216;<em>zonam solvere</em>&#8216; – &#8216;to untie the girdle&#8217;).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the <em>chastity belt</em> (which also encompasses the &#8216;torrid zone between the tropics&#8217;, if you want to be vulgar about it) supposedly made its debut in Western society during the Crusades, lest the mice should play while the cats were off murdering Muslims. They may have been a niche market then, but – under the waggish and consistent alias &#8216;Venus&#8217; belt&#8217; – they were certainly widespread enough by the sixteenth century to become a target for satire. It was not until 1718 that English got the separate word <em>zoned</em>, but its meaning – &#8216;wearing a zone or girdle, hence, chaste&#8217; – was clearly familiar to Francis Quarles, although he&#8217;s not talking about a literal woman, but about the relationship between body and soul.</p>
<p>John Donne plays with this conceit in his <strong><a href="http://www.luminarium.org/sevenlit/donne/elegy20.htm">Elegy: To His Mistress Going To Bed</a></strong>, which famously describes the &#8216;mistress&#8217; in question as &#8216;my America&#8217;. Her &#8216;girdle&#8217; glitters like &#8216;heaven&#8217;s <em>zone</em>&#8216; (viz.: the celestial sphere), but the woman&#8217;s body is itself a &#8216;world&#8217;, a &#8216;new-found land&#8217;, and the speaker&#8217;s &#8216;roving hands&#8217; explorers in a &#8216;kingdom&#8217; – just as in<strong><a href="http://www.luminarium.org/sevenlit/donne/sunrising.htm"> The Sun Rising</a></strong>, &#8216;she&#8217;s all states, and all princes I&#8217;. It&#8217;s not just Donne (<a href="http://www.luminarium.org/sevenlit/carew/rapture.htm">Thomas Carew</a> did it too): think how many landmarks are claimed for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sleeping_Lady">sleeping giantesses</a>, using the female body to map out geographical <em>zones</em>, just as geographical <em>zones</em> can be used to map out a woman (what else is the <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mons_pubis">mons veneris</a></em>?), and think back to <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_2709_2.jpg">Sir Francis Dashwood, landscaping pudendas in his garden</a>.</p>
<p>Much like the <em>zone </em>itself, this Alphabet has tried to encompass various notions of womanhood. Come back soon and maybe there&#8217;ll be a final post mortem-style analysis&#8230; </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<h6 style="text-align: center;">K</h6>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">KNICKERBOCKER</h2>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I should say that a walking suit in which one could not walk, and a winter suit which exposes the throat, head, and feet to cold and damp, was rather a failure,&#8221; said Dr. Alec [who had his own ideas about what his niece should be wearing.]</p>
<p>&#8220;Alec, if it is a Bloomer, I shall protest. I&#8217;ve been expecting it, but I know I cannot bear to see that pretty child sacrificed to your wild ideas of health. Tell me it isn&#8217;t a Bloomer!&#8221; and Mrs. Clara clasped her hands imploringly.</p>
<p>Louisa May Alcott, Eight Cousins (1875)</p></blockquote>
<p>Nope, a <em>knickerbocker. </em>This is a strange word, with an uncertain trajectory from immigration to ladies&#8217; unmentionables, and its progress will here be followed with a suitably bifurcated approach: one leg underwear and one leg outerwear. We meet in the middle.</p>
<div id="attachment_1569" style="width: 172px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Bloomer.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1569" data-attachment-id="1569" data-permalink="/2010/12/13/an-alphabet-of-femininism-11-k-is-for-knickerbocker/bloomer/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Bloomer.gif?fit=162%2C222&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="162,222" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="A Bloomer" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Bloomer.gif?fit=162%2C222&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Bloomer.gif?fit=162%2C222&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1569" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Bloomer.gif?resize=162%2C222" alt="Victorian illustration of a woman modelling a Bloomer suit, 1850s" width="162" height="222" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1569" class="wp-caption-text">Work it. A Bloomer from the 1850s.</p></div>
<p>The word&#8217;s first appearance is in capitalised form: <em>Knickerbocker</em> is the name given to &#8216;a descendent of the original Dutch settlers of the New Netherlands in America; hence, a New Yorker&#8217; – the New &#8216;Netherlands&#8217; becoming, of course, New &#8216;York&#8217; after the English got their grubby hands on it.</p>
<p>The everyday appearance of the term must be attributed to Washington Irving&#8217;s 1848 <em>History of New York</em>, purported to have been written by one &#8216;Diedrich Knickerbocker&#8217;. A long chain, this name was appropriated from Irving&#8217;s pal Herman of the same name, who was in turn descended from Harmen Jansen Knickerbocker (c.1650-1720), one of the original Dutch settlers, who supposedly invented the name. Awesome.</p>
<p>But where are the unmentionables?</p>
<h3>It&#8217;s Over.</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 13px;">These appear in the second sense of the word, a development on the first, from 1859, where it is pluralised to <em>knickerbockers </em>&#8211; &#8216;Loose-fitting breeches, gathered in at the knee; also extended to the whole costume worn with this&#8217;. Irving is once again lurking around, because this usage is said to refer to George Cruikshank&#8217;s illustrations of the same opus. Knickerbockers wear knickerbockers. Duh.</span></p>
<p>These &#8216;loose-fitting breeches gathered at the knee&#8217; became, in another life, standard wear for little boys, whose <em>breeching </em>(the graduation to trousers) consequently became a coming-of-age moment. Short trousers, of course, facilitated easy, boisterous movement, and in <em>Eight Cousins</em>, quoted above, the incorrigibly fashionable Aunt Clara resents her little niece, Rose, wearing such loose-fitting bifurcated garments: &#8216;Dress her in that boyish way and she will act like a boy. I do hate all these inventions of strong-minded women!&#8217;</p>
<p>So <em>Knickerbockers </em>were not simply a New York trend: they were part of sartorial gender differentiation. Little girls wear restrictive petticoats to keep them ladylike; those boys who have graduated from their <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/11/15/an-alphabet-of-femininism-7-g-is-for-girl/">baby-skirts</a> wear garments that allow them to be as boyish as necessary. It is no coincidence that, in their modern incarnation, <em>knickerbockers </em>are kept firmly in the domain of <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/Referee_announces_call_at_UCLA_at_Cal_10-25-08.JPG">sportswear</a>.</p>

<p>The &#8216;Bloomers&#8217; Aunt Clara has such a horror of were the pet project of another <em>Knickerbocker. </em>In the 1850s, Miss Amelia Bloomer, from Cortland County, New York, began a crusade to popularise the &#8216;Bloomer suit&#8217;, not her own invention, but eventually synonymous with her name. This was an Eastern-inspired way to wear your skirt: shorter with the aid of modest, wide-legged trousers that tapered at the knee. Modesty preserved; movement uninhibited. Job done.</p>
<p>But despite enthusiasm from several quarters, Miss Bloomer&#8217;s overall success was limited and <em>bloomers</em> themselves roundly mocked in most quarters for being just too weird. In 1859, she dropped her project altogether because of the arrival of a fresh sartorial development, immediately fashionable, sexually appealing and simple – something that, she felt, did the job of fusing modesty, comfort and practicality just as well. And the name of this marvel? The <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/10/18/an-alphabet-of-femininism-3-c-is-for-crinoline/">crinoline</a>.</p>
<h3>Underneath the Bridge.</h3>
<p>The devoted may remember that this strange hooped structure, by virtue of moving independently of its owner, facilitated the easy movement of the legs underneath. Obviously you could not sally around bareback underneath (as you had <a href="http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/cas/his/CoreArt/art/resources/frag_swing.jpg">mostly done before</a>), and thus the ubiquity of <em>pantalettes </em>(elongated <em>drawers</em>). And here comes the bifurcated garment – not yet <em>knickers</em>, for they are still too long to qualify for a diminutive – relegated to underwear.</p>
<p>These <em>pantalettes</em> were not simply loose cotton trousers like the <em>bloomer</em> (although they could be), but frequently two separate garments, one for each leg; their intent was not to cover one&#8217;s proverbial shame, but rather to keep the legs out of sight (and rather toasty too). Thus, they frequently bifurcated at the rumpal regions rather than the legs themselves, in which form they remained until the turn of the century.</p>
<h3>Daisy, Daisy&#8230;</h3>
<p>It was the strange innovation of the bicycle that, for the first time since Amelia Bloomer, re-addressed the question of external female <em>knickerbockers</em>, for simple safety purposes. Though the haterz still hated, there was something about this new mode of transport that (literally) mobilised a whole generation of women, storming these shocking garments through to respectability on a bicycle. It may come as small surprise to learn that these sartorial liberators came swingin&#8217; back into fashion in the 1960s, epitomised by Yves St. Laurent&#8217;s <a href="http://fashion.1stdibs.com/avl_item_detail.php?id=8823">velvet knickerbocker suit</a>, and extending to gender-neutral clothing, and jeans for both sexes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <em>bloomers </em>were beating a retreat up the leg as Mary Quant advanced a new weapon: the &#8216;mini-skirt&#8217;. For the first time, stockings and the bifurcated undergarments worn with them were conflated, and suddenly there was a need for practical <em>brief </em>coverings (with a name to match) to avoid flashing in the streets and, presumably, to protect the designer <em>tights</em> that went over them. <em>Knickers </em>had arrived. The decline of stockings as status quo prompted some to herald a new &#8216;sexless woman&#8217; (A Good Thing), although this may also have resulted from a vogue for pre-pubescent figures combined with<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_0_bjr_ItnB4/TI-jLfZdPnI/AAAAAAAABFI/Ov5pxjzzaD4/s1600/twiggy1.jpg"> ambiguous schoolgirl traditions:</a> puffed sleeves, pinafores, Mary-Janes and little boy-shorts. A strange sort of liberation, perhaps.</p>

<h6 style="text-align: center;">G</h6>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">GIRL</h2>
<blockquote><p>And alone in the midst of all this lumber and decay, and ugly age, the beautiful child in her gentle slumber, smiling through her light and sunny dreams.<br />
&#8211; <strong>Charles Dickens, The Old Curiosity Shop</strong> (1841)</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8216;Twas brillig</strong></p>
<p>Picture the linguistic landscape of the thirteenth century. Full of bastard Latin, Anglo-Norman, smatterings of Anglo-Saxon crudities, and a few words whose origins nobody knows. Sometime around 1290, the word <em>girl </em>appeared, used to signify ‘a child or young person of either sex’, alongside clarifying compounds <em>knave girl </em>and <em>gay girl </em>(‘boy’ and, er, ‘girl’ respectively). Like some tantalisingly similar words &#8211; <em>lad, lass, boy </em>&#8211; its provenance is unclear, although some cunning linguists would have it derive ultimately (via some torturous and dark history) from the Greek &#8216;parthenos&#8217; (=&#8217;virgin&#8217;). But yes, uh huh, you read right: in its earliest incarnation, <em>girl </em>was ungendered. In fact, it was not until the 1530s that its more specific application to XX chromosomes surfaced, with <em>girl </em>meaning ‘a female child’ &#8211; and even then, it still had its enduring reference to &#8216;a roebuck in its second year&#8217;, with roe<em>buck</em> being, naturally, the male equivalent of <em>roe</em> (a deer, a female deer).</p>

<p>So the Sylvanian Deer Family would be made up of a roebuck, a roedeer, and, perhaps a (male) girl. Not actually that uncommon: after all, we classify animals via male, female and child (calf, cow, bull; pup, bitch, dog) with a third, genderless young&#8217;un alongside their sexually mature parents all the time.</p>
<p>Here comes an art history aside to <em>girl&#8217;</em>s ambiguous beginnings: glancing, for example at<a href="http://gallery.e2bn.org/imagelarge70483-abolition.html"> Queen Victoria with her family</a>, a  <a href="http://www.artchive.com/artchive/v/velazquez/velazquez_prince.jpg">young prince of Spain</a>, or even an English <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/exhibitions/hogarth/images/works/the_graham_children.jpg">merchant family of the 1740s</a>, the gender identities of the under-6s seem, well, fluid at best. I should add that, in the case of the Spanish Royal Family, the eldest prince (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balthasar_Charles,_Prince_of_Asturias">Baltasar Carlos</a>) leaps straight from painterly petticoats to politically potent riding gear and full armour with apparently no mid-point whatsoever. Another prince, the young Charles II, appears in full armour aged twelve, although in his case there were excellent practical reasons for the switchover (lol revolution). There is also James Northcote&#8217;s portrait (right) of John Ruskin, art historian, antiquarian, arguable founder of the National Trust, patron of the Pre-Raphaelites and sometime author &#8211; aged three and a half. Manly indeed.</p>
<p>This could speak of a reluctance to bother gendering the child until that gender could be of socio-political relevance (something infant mortality could only have encouraged), but that is not to say it went un-bemoaned by the children themselves. The poet Rainer Maria Rilke complained bitterly of his mother&#8217;s reign of sartorial terror: &#8216;I had to wear beautiful long dresses, and until I started school I went about like a little girl. I think my mother played with me as though I were a big <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/10/25/an-alphabet-of-femininism-4-d-is-for-doll/">doll</a>.&#8217; I am also reminded of the story that hit headlines in Sweden about<a href="http://www.thelocal.se/20232/20090623/"> a couple who refused to gender their two-year-old at all, for fear of falling into gender&#8217;s traps</a>.</p>
<h3>Not yet a woman</h3>

<p>But, as we may ask of this Swedish child, what happens to <em>girl </em>once its gender has been set? Well, one of its first gender-specific definitions is, as of 1668, ‘a maid of all work’; <em>sweetheart</em> or <em>mistress</em> makes its appearance towards the end of the eighteenth century (as in the popular song ‘The Girl I Left Behind Me&#8217;); and it appears in compound reference to prostitution – <em>a kind girl, girl about town</em>. These are all potentially belittling terms for female-orientated stations in life, which can nonetheless retain a flattering appeal ­– think <a href="http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0027816/">Patsy Stone</a> and her insistence on being referred to as &#8216;mademoiselle&#8217;; or, more psychotically, think Bette Davis in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ck-Uo52MOg">W<em>hatever Happened To Baby Jane</em></a>?</p>
<p>So, actually, as <em>girl </em>grows up, it sexes up: indeed, once gendered firmly female, its sexual identity becomes more complicated, and this is something that seems to go alongside a developing idea of what early youth actually <em>is</em>. It is only really with the Victorians that the ‘cult of childhood’ really came into being, upheld by luminaries such as J. M. Barrie, Ruskin himself, Charles Dickens and, of course, Lewis Carroll.</p>
<p>This is where whispers start snaking around history, and it feels fitting that the term <em>paedophilia erotica </em>did not come into diagnostic existence until 1886, for this was arguably the first time childhood was regarded with fetishism (as later underlines the actions of &#8216;poet and pervert&#8217; Humbert Humbert, in Nabokov&#8217;s now-notorious <em>Lolita</em>). <em>Girls</em> suddenly become not simply small genderless adults, but (feminine) symbols of what adulthood is seen to lack: innocence, purity and beauty, as in Dickens&#8217; <em>The Old Curiosity Shop</em>, whose Little Nell loves to say her prayers. Dickens&#8217; adult females fare little better, of course, and the Victorian infantalisation of women proves <em>girl </em>in grown-up action, and a topic for another day.</p>
<p>This, then, is the context for Carroll&#8217;s photography, but it is important to note that, whatever their evidence for something darker, their subject matter was by no means original: Carroll&#8217;s contemporary, Julia Margaret Cameron, produced many <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_MmRVVROy-Jo/ShwBSPlo2CI/AAAAAAAADAE/gxI5PfHTgNM/s400/Julia+Margaret+Cameron6.jpg">similar images</a> (worksafety check: mild nudity) that played on girlish simplicity for typically Victorian effect.</p>
<blockquote><p>[She was] the most beautiful little girl that Tom had ever seen. Her cheeks were almost as white as the pillow and her hair was like threads of gold spread all about over the bed.</p>
<p>He wondered if she was a real live person, or one of the wax dolls he had seen in the shops.</p>
<p>&#8211; Charles Kingsley, The Water Babies (1862-3)</p></blockquote>
<p>A strange journey, then: a word that commences genderless and ends sexualised and technically belittling (&#8216;the checkout girl&#8217;), but without much perceptible backlash from the female population. Are we not all Patsy Stones?</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">CRINOLINE</h3>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p>In the 1956 version of <strong>The King and I</strong>, there&#8217;s a bit where Anna Leonowens (Deborah Kerr) is surrounded by an army of small children trying to lift her skirt up. Understandably disturbed (her background is, after all, in the mores of Victoriana), she seeks an explanation from the eponymous King&#8217;s &#8216;head wife&#8217;, who replies placidly that they think she is dressed like that because she&#8217;s &#8220;<span style="font-style: italic;">shaped </span>like that&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I certainly am NOT,&#8221; she replies, lifting up her crinoline to reveal a neat little pair of ankle-length bloomers.</p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">The King and I </span>was one of my mother&#8217;s army of VHS tapes recorded off 1990s TV to keep her offspring pacified of a Saturday night, and I always watched Deborah Kerr sailing around the orientalist palace with a confusion similar to that expressed by the child army. Why did these women wear clothes that made them look like a different species from their male counterparts? It&#8217;s apparently illogical, one of fashion&#8217;s <a href="http://www.thefashionpolice.net/images/2008/07/08/harem_pants.jpg">many confusing mistakes</a>, yet the big skirt trend was one that dominated female fashion for at least three centuries, and continued to have iconic moments long after the Victorians. In fact, it&#8217;s a true constant, from Madame de Pompadour and Elizabeth the First to Dior&#8217;s New Look, Marilyn Monroe&#8217;s subway moment, <em>Grease </em>(where Sandy rejecting it in favour of spray-on wet look leggings always feels troubling), and, relatively more recently, the designs of Vivienne Westwood.</p>
<p>There is an obvious explanation for its attractiveness which can be seen simply by looking at the silhouette: in algebraic terms, massive hips = lots of lovely womb space to let. In the case of the twentieth century&#8217;s most famous blonde, the explanation reaches new realms of subtlety (big skirt + wind + camera = £££). But this precludes their frequent favour with the women themselves: Madame de Pompadour and Marie Antoinette were, as Westwood is, fashion leaders, not followers, and it cannot be denied that there is a certain something about a skirt with a big twirl factor that feels inoffensively joyful. And looking back to Elizabeth &#8216;Heart and Stomach of a Man&#8217; The First, it seems unlikely that the Ditchley Portrait is trying to convey nothing more than Hey Boys, Check Out My Womb.</p>
<h2><strong>Hair of the Dog</strong></h2>
<p>So what <span style="font-style: italic;">is </span>a &#8216;crinoline&#8217;? It&#8217;s actually something very specific; in its original sense specific enough to be a brand name, referring to &#8216;a stiff fabric made of horse-hair and cotton or linen thread&#8217;. The brand name in question uses <em>crinoline</em>&#8216;s literal meaning, &#8216;hair-thread&#8217; to allude to its composition from horse hair, but later on, <em>crinoline</em> comes to refer to other materials, such as &#8216;whalebone or iron hoops&#8217;, which serve to expand petticoats. The dictionary gives as a second definition the crucial word &#8216;hoop-petticoat&#8217;, which it glosses as something &#8216;worn under the skirt of a woman&#8217;s dress in order to support or distend it&#8217;.</p>

Check out the womb.</p></div>
<p>This &#8216;hoop-petticoat&#8217; was the eighteenth century term for the big skirt, and here it took the form of an architectural arrangement of side-panniers so wide that doorways frequently had to be expanded to accommodate their wearers. But it was not something new: on the contrary, the hoop bore no small resemblance to earlier innovations, most notably the sixteenth-century (Ditchley Portrait) &#8216;farthingale&#8217;, supposedly so named in reference to the wooden structure that gave it its shape – which was, ironically enough, a sort of wooden cage. Conversely, the <em>crinoline</em>, a nineteenth century invention, reached new heights of freedom, since for the first time the skirt could move independently of its owner, a phenomenon that may have led to the Victorian preoccupation with ankles, but which certainly created a new erotic focus for men walking through the park on a windy day. Previous to this, women hankering after widened hips had to wear many layers of heavy under-petticoats in addition to the cage-structure, which not only hindered their movement but also hampered the skirt&#8217;s possible circumference, so once the light and airy crinoline-cage appeared, a side-effect was the virtually limitless expansion of the skirt&#8217;s width – reaching its nexus in Anna Leonowens&#8217; ridiculous garments, whose recreation in 1956 combined the excesses of the New Look silhouette with the historical extravagance of the Victorian empire.</p>
<p>Indeed, it is perhaps here that the crinoline shows its teeth: the well-known <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aVbJhg23Ao">Getting To Know You</a> sequence shows a maternal, wide-hipped Anna Leonowens sitting among her Gentle Savage pupils and breezing about the palace with an ease denied to the stiffly clad king&#8217;s wives, making the big skirt somehow emblematic of the West&#8217;s superior treatment of women, and the &#8216;enlightened ideas&#8217; of the British Empire, while its unstoppable expansion may itself have something to do with the ever-increasing size of colonial ambition.</p>
<h2><strong>Her crinoline defences</strong></h2>
<p>Perhaps, then, with all these sartorial possibilities, it was to be expected that the term should gradually itself expand, to encompass transferred meanings: a piece of diving equipment allowing the diver to &#8216;breathe more freely&#8217; – of course, everyone knows about whalebone&#8217;s famous facilitation of easy breathing – and, for ships, a &#8216;defence against torpedoes&#8217;. I particularly enjoy the use of traditional pronouns in the last citation the dictionary gives, from 1885: &#8216;Her crinoline defences against torpedoes&#8217;, because it returns to one of the petticoat&#8217;s primary social significations, mooted in The Spectator way back circa 1711:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8216;Our sex has of late years been very saucy, and [so] the Hoop-Petticoat is made use of to keep us at a distance&#8217;.<br />
The Spectator, 1711</p></blockquote>
<p>Another journal commented that the hoop&#8217;s &#8216;compass&#8217; keeps &#8216;men at a decent distance, and appropriates to every lady a spacious verge sacred to herself&#8217;. It is interesting to note the strength words in this context – from the whalebone &#8216;supporting and distending&#8217; the skirt, steel hoops and all the way to the initial definition of the word as a &#8216;stiff lining&#8217;. The suggestion here could be that the structures underneath a woman&#8217;s clothes must either lend strength to something fundamentally flimsy (that old &#8216;body of a weak and feeble woman&#8217; chesnut), or, conversely, that this is a type of armour, the armour worn by, as Elizabeth I would probably have put it, a &#8216;king, and a king of England too&#8217;. In the queen&#8217;s case, I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s something going on with metaphorical hip-circumferance fertility: the virgin mother of the nation, but one whose regal power gives her a strength akin to a sacrificed Christ, a mother who will fight tooth and nail to protect her child-country. Less maternal, more martial?</p>
