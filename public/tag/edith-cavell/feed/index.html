										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This edition of Found Feminism is also part of a series on the theme of women and protest. The full series is collected <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/tag/revolting-women/">under the tag &#8220;Revolting Women&#8221;</a>.</em></p>
<p>They meet every Wednesday at 6pm and stand around<a href="http://www.ukattraction.com/london/edith-cavell-memorial-statue.htm"> the statue of legendary badass</a> and feminist hero <a href="http://www.edithcavell.org.uk/">Edith Cavell</a>, wearing black and holding signs. They don&#8217;t speak. They have an awesome homemade banner with some very cool patchwork stitching on it. We at BadRep Towers are very fond of both <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/06/20/badrep-goes-slutwalking/">banners</a> and <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/07/12/found-feminism-patchwork-of-the-century/">patchwork</a>.</p>

<p>They are the <a href="http://www.womeninblack.org/en/london"><strong>Women in Black</strong></a>. Not to be confused with their <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRuHk6Drj2U">male counterparts</a> &#8211; the Women in Black are probably not our &#8216;best, last and only line of defence&#8217; against extra-terrestrial invasion, although I wouldn&#8217;t put it past them.</p>
<p>So, who are they and why is it a Found Feminism? Well, they&#8217;re an international network that offer a specific form of peaceful protest model &#8211; wear black, hold signs, don&#8217;t chant &#8211; and link up all the people (men AND women) in the world who do this or who want to do it.</p>
<p>Women in Black officially started off in the late 80s in Israel with women protesting against the occupation of Palestine, but they acknowledge their roots in much earlier female-led non-violent movements such as <a href="http://www.blacksash.org.za/">Black Sash</a> and the<a href="http://www.wilpfinternational.org/"> Women&#8217;s International League for Peace and Freedom</a>.</p>
<p>Women in Black are therefore part of a much wider story about the long-term involvement of women, and feminists, in the peace movement, in anti-war demonstrations and in alternative (including non-violent) forms of protest and revolution.</p>
<p>At a time of shouty, flash-in-the-pan protests and unpredictable acts of anger, a regular, silent protest is interesting in and of itself. It&#8217;s a reminder of the other ways to influence and change the world, as well as recognising the value of solidarity across borders. Something Edith herself would have probably approved of.</p>
<blockquote><p>Patriotism is not enough. I must have no hatred or bitterness towards anyone.</p>
<p>&#8211; Edith Cavell </p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG00373-20110709-20031.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full aligncenter" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG00373-20110709-20031.jpg?resize=300%2C225" alt="" width="300" height="225" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>This is found feminism only in the sense that I found it entirely by accident. I was waiting to meet my dining companion for dim sum on the South Bank (yes, I know&#8230;) and when they texted to say they were going to be another half an hour I went for a wander. Finding myself in the <strong>Southbank Centre</strong>&#8216;s exhibition about the <strong>Festival of Britain</strong> in 1951 (it&#8217;s in the basement) I was delighted to come across a wonderful artwork, the <a href="http://embroidery.embroiderersguild.com/2002-6/imgs/patchwork.htm"><strong>Patchwork of the Century</strong></a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Designed by Lillian Dring with contributions from some of the 80 women who helped to make it (who had no previous experience of needlework) it&#8217;s quite beautiful, to my eyes. Even more so when I learned the whole thing was made from scraps of old uniforms, tablecloths and blackout fabric.</p>
<p>It was originally part of a Women of the Century exhibition in Twickenham in 1951, and includes some feminist historical landmarks such as (obviously) women winning the vote, but also the opening of Girton College and women&#8217;s contribution to both world wars. Pioneering nurse and humanitarian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edith_Cavell">Edith Cavell</a> has her own patch.</p>
<p>Next time you&#8217;re down that way pop into the exhibition and have a look, it&#8217;s worth it.</p>
