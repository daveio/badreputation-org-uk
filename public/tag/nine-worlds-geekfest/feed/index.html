										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few weekends ago, I was immersed in geekdom. Yes, it was the first <a href="https://nineworlds.co.uk/" title="Nine Worlds Geek Fest" target="_blank">Nine Worlds Geekfest </a>, and my main problem was that I couldn’t clone myself to go to all the panels I was interested in (read more about Team BadRep&#8217;s Nine Worlds experience <a href="/2013/09/11/what-does-an-inclusive-sci-fi-con-look-like-a-post-nine-worlds-roundtable/">here</a> </p>
<p>One of the most amazing things I saw was, without question, the screening of the <a href="http://wonderwomendoc.com/" title="Wonder Women! : the Untold Story of American Heroines" target="_blank"><strong>Wonder Women! : the Untold Story of American Heroines</strong> </a> documentary.</p>
<p>I’d never heard of it before to be honest, which is hardly surprising as it&#8217;s an independent release (no screening near you? Organise one &#8211; there&#8217;s a link at the bottom of this post!).  It’s basically a visual look at the intersections of Women Woman iconography and certain aspects of Second Wave American feminism. </p>
<p>Did you know that Wonder Woman was regarded by quite a few feminists as the &#8216;face&#8217;of Second Wave American feminism? Neither did I. Quite frankly, being a Marvel girl rather than DC, I’d always thought of Wonder Woman as one of the more tame, conservative superheroes.  Didn’t she spend most of her time being tied up? </p>

<p>I’m now going to recount my new and shiny understanding of Wonder Woman, as gleaned from the documentary through a vague haze of alcohol. Bear with me.</p>
<h3>The iconography of Wonder Woman</h3>
<p>Wonder Woman, it turns out, is fairly awesome. She was developed during World War II, and was therefore off fighting the Nazis (alongside Captain America? That bit wasn’t very clear) after realising that she had to go off and save America. Because that’s what awesome heroes did. She even had to win some sort of Olympiad before she was able to do it! And then she fought some Nazis, and some criminals, and in the 50s this was deemed to be DREADFUL. So she was rewritten as having <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Wonder_Woman_Vol_1_179" title="Because nothing says 'superhero' like CUPCAKES!">given up her powers</a>. During this period she found she wanted to make cakes, and opened a beauty parlour. OF COURSE. Because nothing says &#8216;superhero&#8217; like CUPCAKES!</p>
<p>Anyway, along came Second Wave feminism, looking for a face for the recently-launched <strong>Ms magazine.</strong> And there was poor Wonder Woman, an icon in need of reclaiming. Off came the apron and on went on the magic bracelets! </p>
<h3>SURELY IT IS TIME FOR THE 70S?</h3>
<p>I won’t recount the entire documentary. Suffice to say that when the 1970s and 1980s kicked off, along with them came a whole slew of female heroines, from <strong>Cagney and Lacey</strong>, <strong>Charlie’s Angels</strong> and <strong>Bionic Woman</strong>, straight through to the live-action Wonder Woman herself, Lynda Carter.</p>
<p>Here, have a photo of her being awesome:</p>

<h3>Ripley vs Van Damme</h3>
<p>The 1980s also gave us hyper-masculinity along the lines of Van Damme, Schwarzenegger and Stallone. It also gave us <strong>Ellen Ripley</strong> and (in 1991 admittedly, therefore <em>just</em> in the 1990s) <strong>Sarah Connor.</strong> There are a bunch of others. The 1980s were pretty awesome for strong female heroines, which is a sentence I never thought I’d be writing. When I first saw Terminator 2 as a little girl, <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&#038;rct=j&#038;q=&#038;esrc=s&#038;source=web&#038;cd=4&#038;cad=rja&#038;ved=0CD0QFjAD&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FSarah_Connor_(Terminator)&#038;ei=0kERUuTqLsrB7Aa2r4G4DA&#038;usg=AFQjCNHvYQeY8-F59Gshco85lBqLjI_t7w&#038;sig2=EVcpwXcomlwd7QG5hbUEWw&#038;bvm=bv.50768961,d.d2k" title="Terminator 2" target="_blank">I didn’t even know that women could do chin-ups</a>!</p>
<h3>Grrrl Power dominoes</h3>
<p>As well as the iconography of Wonder Woman herself, the documentary looked at the development of Grrrl Power.  We are taken through the original use of the term through interviews with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Hanna" title="Kathleen Hanna (Wikipedia)" target="_blank">Kathleen Hanna</a>, starting back with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_Grrrl" title="Riot Grrrl (Wikipedia)" target="_blank">Riot Grrrl</a>, and its appropriation by the Spice Girls into something commercial. </p>
<p>I’m not going to depress you by taking you through the deaths of all the &#8216;strong female characters&#8217; on television in 2001. I think those of us in the UK were somewhat sheltered through the impact of that, having our reception of those shows delayed by several weeks or even months.

<p>&#8230; and to her fans, ages 2–99. In the documentary, there are interviews with small children and the role Wonder Woman has played in their lives.  There are interviews with activists &#8211; up to and including Gloria Steinem &#8211; and their perspectives on how Wonder Woman influenced Second Wave (and in some case Third Wave) feminism – and vice versa.  There are perspectives on women-saving-women and the creation of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Wonder-Woman-Day/152248224786224" title="Wonder Woman Day (Facebook)" target="_blank">Wonder Woman Day</a>. There’s even a Wonder-Woman-on-a-string-with-motor, making her fly around and around on a child’s ceiling. How awesome is that? I want one!</p>
<h3>Not your grandmother&#8217;s feminism</h3>
<p>Now let&#8217;s talk about what <em>wasn&#8217;t</em> there. The film isn&#8217;t marketed as a history of Second Wave Feminism, nor even the (entire) history of Wonder Woman. That&#8217;s important, because the intersections the film is talking about are intersections with white, heterosexual, cis feminism. It therefore falls down significantly on the feminism movement outside of that pretty narrowly defined range. </p>
<p>It was also a bit dispiriting to not have at least a mention that the original name for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ms_magazine" title="Ms. Magazine" target="_blank"><strong>Ms. magazine</strong></a> was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sojourner_Truth" title="Sojourner Truth" target="_blank"><strong>Sojourner</strong></a>. There is also little mention of the subversion of the Wonder Woman image and iconography outside of radfem activism. </p>
<p>That said, the film doesn&#8217;t pretend that it is in any way comprehensive, or representative of all feminism movements. And, as a look at the history of Wonder Woman and how she was reclaimed in the radfem part of Second (and Third) Wave American feminism… well, it’s pretty awesome. </p>
<p>Frankly, it’s worth watching for the interviews with her tiny modern-day fans alone.  There is something deeply heartening about hearing a child draw strength from a feminist icon, however corrupted and reinterpreted that image has been over the years.</p>
<p>Not convinced? Have a look at the trailer:</p>
<p><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/36060144?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="400" height="300" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></p>
<p>See? <em>Awesome</em>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>A little late in being posted, perhaps, but hopefully still of interest! In which three BadReppers &#8211; <strong>Hannah Chutzpah</strong>, <strong>Stephen B</strong> and <strong>Viktoriya</strong> &#8211; chat about their experiences at <strong>Nine Worlds Geekfest</strong> this summer, and more generally about conventions, fandom and feminism.</em></p>
<h2>A more inclusive con?</h2>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/9w.jpeg"><img data-attachment-id="14010" data-permalink="/2013/09/11/what-does-an-inclusive-sci-fi-con-look-like-a-post-nine-worlds-roundtable/9w/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/9w.jpeg?fit=259%2C194&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="259,194" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="9w" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/9w.jpeg?fit=259%2C194&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/9w.jpeg?fit=259%2C194&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/9w-150x150.jpeg?resize=150%2C150" alt="9w" width="150" height="150" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-14010" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><strong>Stephen B:</strong> &#8220;I first noticed how unusually inclusive <a href="https://nineworlds.co.uk/" target="_blank">Nine Worlds</a> was about two minutes after collecting my badge from the front desk. Wandering down the corridor I found myself in&#8230; a <a href="https://nineworlds.co.uk/track/geek-feminism" target="_blank">geek feminism</a> session. </p>
<p>&#8220;I was greeted cheerfully and given a quick intro to what was going on, and then left to join the various groups sitting around the (very popular) room at tables and in small lively seated circles on the floor. The crowd in this room didn’t know my views or that I write for BadRep, and I’m a straight white male &#8211; generally not a famously marginalised group &#8211; but I felt immediately welcome. </p>
<p>&#8220;In the next room along, Bronies were playing guitar and handing out cupcakes. They also had a rave DJ. In that moment, I suspected this wasn’t going to be a typical SF convention.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Safe space?</h2>
<p><strong>Viktoriya:</strong> &#8220;I went to Nine Worlds and I wasn&#8217;t groped, harassed, belittled or condescended to. I felt comfortable enough to walk around dressed in my own clothes, and not necessarily the elaborate armour of ballgowns, cosplay or similar I&#8217;d adopted when frequenting prior conventions. </p>
<p>&#8220;More to the point, I felt comfortable enough to go around ON MY OWN. I can&#8217;t stress this enough. I stopped going to conventions because it had become apparent to me that I was paying a great deal of money to attend an event where it was pretty much guaranteed that I would be assaulted in some way, whereas daily assault is something most women can have for free simply by walking down the street in London. Why pay for the privilege?&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Not being groped, forcibly intoxicated, called a cocktease, an uppity feminist, a silly little girl, or asked to kiss someone for the amusement of male onlookers – it was like a whole new world.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Also, I managed to convince my work friend to come with me to Nine Worlds. You guys, you have no idea of the stress associated with this. </p>
<p>&#8220;What if someone was a dick to her? What if she was assaulted? What if she hated it? Then I would be the work friend who convinced her to spend money on the the thing that was dreadful. </p>
<p>&#8220;So not being groped, forcibly intoxicated, called a cocktease, an uppity feminist, a silly little girl, or asked to kiss someone for the amusement of male onlookers &#8211; it was like a whole new world.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Stephen:</strong> &#8220;It seems that every big convention recently has had a wave of harassment and bad experiences for some attendees. NineWorlds appeared to do things right instead, with a kick-ass <A href= https://nineworlds.co.uk/anti-harassment-policy >anti-harassment policy</a> and some seriously great content.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Running a content track</h2>

I spent pretty much the whole run-up panicking and convinced my everything would be a huge disaster&#8230;. right up until the second session where my longtime frenemy &#8211; author <a href="https://nineworlds.co.uk/guest/hannah-eiseman-renyard" target="_blank"><strong>Chris Farnell</strong></a> &#8211; gave a talk on &#8216;<a href="https://nineworlds.co.uk/track/news/2013/08/02/working-time-machine-writing-time-travel-so-it-makes-sense" target="_blank">Working the Time Machine: writing time travel so it makes sense&#8217;</a>. </p>
<p>&#8220;We had a packed out room, with people hanging out the doors. Then, as the crowds left and I patted Chris and myself on the back, starting to believe this whole thing might work &#8211; this toy car, sent by the Bronies (pictured) whirred through the door full of cupcakes.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Fandom and atmosphere</h2>
<p><strong>Stephen: </strong>&#8220;Nine Worlds is set up to include a wide range of fandoms and geekery, and all the different fans are welcome in the same space. There was <em>so much</em> going on, I barely saw the other Team BadRep folks.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t just &#8216;here&#8217;s the gay corner&#8217;, so it felt much more open to (say) the B and the T and the Q of &#8216;LGBTQ*&#8217;. Which &#8211; as a bi girl &#8211; I found very, very refreshing.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Hannah:</strong> &#8220;I didn&#8217;t get out to as much of the rest of the fest as you two, but the main thing which spilled across every room, hallway, lobby, breakfast bar and so on was the extremely friendly and welcoming nature of the whole conference. </p>
<p>&#8220;The only other geek con I&#8217;ve been to was the SFX weekender, which wasn&#8217;t <em>unfriendly </em>, but I also can&#8217;t remember half as much mingling (or half as many reasons to mingle) as there were here.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Stephen:</strong> &#8220;I’m not a convention-goer. The friendly atmosphere and lack of judging at Nine Worlds was the kind of pleasant, safe space I’d assume any good con would try for, but from everything I’ve heard in recent years this one got it unusually right. </p>
<p>&#8220;I saw tweets from people saying that having dedicated LGBTQ* content made such a difference to their time there. Even the Bronies didn’t seem to get the usual derision, mostly because they were just unrelentingly happy and frequently gave you cake.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Faves?</h2>
<p><strong>Hannah:</strong> The two standout workshops for me, personally, were fantasy novelist <a href="http://tompollock.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Tom Pollock&#8217;s</strong></a> creative writing workshop on Making Monsters &#8211; which generated at least one idea I&#8217;m going to be writing into a short story. </p>
<p>&#8220;Also, <a href="http://www.enewman.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>Emma Newman</strong></a> ran a workshop on &#8216;Fear and Writing&#8217; &#8211; drawing on <a href="http://www.enewman.co.uk/writing/the-writers-rutter/when-just-write-is-not-enough" target="_blank">her own experiences as an author</a>. </p>
<p>&#8220;Two takeaway things for me were her describing procrastination as a fear-based behaviour, and<br />
that perfectionism is fear&#8217;s favourite coat. Emma &#8211; thank you. That stuff really spoke to me. Like, more than my shrink does.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Hannah:</strong> &#8220;And since it wasn&#8217;t &#8216;here&#8217;s the gay corner&#8217; it felt much more open to (say) the B and the T and the Q sections. Which &#8211; as a bi girl &#8211; I found very, very refreshing.&#8221; </p>
<p><strong>Stephen:</strong> &#8220;On the Friday night I went to a swordfighting workshop with Miltos Yerolemou, the actor who played Syrio Forel in <strong>Game of Thrones</strong>. </p>
<p>&#8220;It was a <em>lot</em> of fun, and at least two thirds of the attendees were women (one of whom was you, Viktoriya, and I totally clocked your expression of demonic glee when you got to swing a very large wooden sword, which suggested you enjoyed the session!).&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Viktoriya:</strong> &#8220;I loved that there was a knitting track, and a <strong>My Little Pony</strong> track, and a board games track. It stressed the diversity of interests that are brought together under the fandom and geek umbrellas in a way that cannot be present in any single-show or single-theme convention. </p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that the &#8216;celebrity guests&#8217; were actually there for panels, activities and workshops primarily, with singing autographs very much a secondary activity, was even better. I despair of the autograph factories modern conventions have become. Queueing for eight hours is not my idea of fun.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Could-do-betters?</h2>
<p><strong>Viktoriya:</strong> &#8220;Well, OK, let me argue with myself for a little bit. I&#8217;m going to nitpick here, not out of anger but because the organisers have shown a genuine interest in learning from their mistakes and in improving the experience in coming years.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, accessibility. I don&#8217;t know what the experience was for those attendees with limited mobility, but I am relatively able-bodied and even I found it a bit cumbersome navigating the stairs in two hotels with only the few lifts. </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Ultimately, that’s what I’m looking for in a convention: committing to doing better next time when mistakes are made.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Some of the multimedia was a little difficult to engage with without risking pain &#8211; strobe lighting, very loud soundscape, and so on. </p>
<p>&#8220;Bringing in a general warning system (a sign on the door?) of strobe lighting for those affected by it, and doing a soundcheck before launching the sound and leaving it at whatever level, would be good.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Stephen:</strong> &#8220;I went to the board games hotel only briefly, and there were lots of steep stairs, but then that&#8217;s the one used for loads of much bigger cons, so I&#8217;m sure they must have a solution in place?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Viktoriya:</strong> &#8220;Well, big cons tend to have a like it or lump it policy. They have priority queuing for fans with mobility issues, but that&#8217;s about it as far as I&#8217;m aware. Individual cons may have a better provision, but I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then there&#8217;s the issue of diversity in organisers and session leads. Part of this is maybe due to the fact that it was the first Nine Worlds, but the organisers, session leads and attendees were overwhelmingly white. </p>
<p>&#8220;Take the panel on <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2013/nineworlds/scmcwd/" target="_blank">Problematic Issues</a> &#8211; some odd things were said during this sessions, and it was also an entirely white panel (so discussing representations of race was rather awkward). I think it was trying to cover too many fandom issues: racism in fanfic and fandom, fetishing gay sex, writing male characters and ignoring female ones, reaffirming heteronormative norms, etc. In an hour.</p>
<p>&#8220;Contrast this with the <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2013/nineworlds/scmdgy/ " target="_blank">Racefail 101 panel</a> in the Books track, which brought together awesome writers of colour to focus on writing characters of colour, and seeking out writers of colour.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given the number of tracks and the number of organisers required, I&#8217;d suggest that the lead organisers work on diversifying the track leads.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;With accessibility, big cons tend to have a like-it-or-lump-it policy. They have priority queuing for fans with mobility issues, but often that’s about it.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p> &#8220;Finally, I disagree with Steve on the inclusiveness extended to the Bronies, mostly because in the sessions I was present at, they were frequently the butt of the joke. </p>
<p>&#8220;Fundamentally, I think it&#8217;s uncool to include something as a track (and therefore give implicit approval of its existence) and then spend the weekend being a bit weirded out by it. I don&#8217;t claim to be part of the MLP fandom, but I thought it was a bit harsh.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Stephen:</strong> &#8220;I didn&#8217;t see the panels where Bronies were mocked, but I did see a lot of people commenting out loud that this was their first experience of them and they thought Bronies were awesome.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Viktoriya:</strong> &#8220;I wonder if part of it isn&#8217;t a reflexive &#8216;let&#8217;s build a hierarchy&#8217; instinct. Certainly there was that feeling at times at the fanfic panels, and some of the comments re: board gaming from attendees. The Bronies were the only ones where I heard panellists commenting on it, though, and there is <a href="http://mechanicalhamster.wordpress.com/2013/08/12/a-great-geekend-part-1-friday/#more-906" target="_blank">some evidence that attendees felt a bit singled out</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What I do think is great is that the organisers of the Problematic Issues panel realised what had gone wrong, and have <a href="http://ladymoonray.livejournal.com/875717.html" target="_blank">publically acknowledged it</a> and committed to doing better next time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ultimately, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m looking for in a convention. There were a few tweeted mentions of positive and negative feedback (which, to their credit, the Nine Worlds twitter feed retweeted).&#8221;</p>
<h2>Let&#8217;s wrap this up&#8230;</h2>
<p><strong>Hannah:</strong> &#8220;I think everyone involved understands it was a first attempt at a huge thing and the learning curve was, and will continue to be, pretty damn steep – but I couldn’t be prouder to be a part of it or more excited about next year.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Viktoriya:</strong> &#8220;Since there&#8217;s a year until the next Nine Worlds I guess I&#8217;ll conclude with some general links on the inclusion and harassment issues &#8211; if you&#8217;re thinking of going to a convention and are concerned about safety, or if you have been harassed at a convention and want to know how to report it, have a look at these resources:</p>
<ul>
<li>Elise Mathesen&#8217;s experience of reporting sexual harassment <a href="http://seanan-mcguire.livejournal.com/517984.html" target="_blank">here</a>, including a contact and resource list for reporting it <a href="http://www.jimchines.com/2013/07/reporting-sexual-harassment-2013/" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
<li>Carrie Cuinn&#8217;s experiences and guide for reporting are <a href="http://carriecuinn.com/2013/06/30/please-stop-touching-my-breasts-and-other-things-i-say-at-cons/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://carriecuinn.com/2013/07/02/sexual-harassment-at-cons-part-2-how-to-stop-it-and-other-thoughts/" target="_blank">here</a> </li>
<li>Finally, the odious Ted Beale was recently finally expelled from <a href="http://www.locusmag.com/News/2013/08/beale-expelled-from-sfwa/" target="_blank">SFWA</a>. NK Jemisin has written <a href="http://nkjemisin.com/2013/08/time-to-pick-a-side/" target="_blank">a blisteringy on-point post</a> on racism and misogyny in SFF, Beale&#8217;s expulsion, and the behaviour which led to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;Most of all, I loved the fact that I enjoyed Nine Worlds so much, I have already decided I&#8217;m going next year. No uncertainty, no hmm-maybe and oh-yes-perhaps. I&#8217;m going next year because it was wonderful. How can you argue with that?&#8221;</p>
