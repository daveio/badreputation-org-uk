					<description><![CDATA[This review is about as accurate as it gets. Zack has basically just seen inception, thought to himself &quot;wow, I really like confusing concepts. Im now going to go and shit all over myself and roll around in it until Im so high I can write something that makes no sense&quot;. Sorry for the graphic imagery but this guy cannot be called a film maker as he relies on CGI saving his ass for every little piece of shit he makes. Now that my rant is out of the way ....... here is how I really think he stole his themes.

He blatantly has watched/looked at a load of anime, jotted down some of the images he liked and took them to his art designer and said &quot;yeh, I like little girls in their school uniforms and oooh yeh I really like samurai swords....oh and she should have a gun....yeh! now mix that with the confusing shit I rolled around in earlier and we have ourselves a hit!&quot;

hang on a minute any one see a complete and blatant rip off devil may cry and almost any other anime heroins?

Seriously shut this guy down before he actually causes me to kill myself in a cinema. This is the one film that makes me say &quot;actually piracy is a good thing! It stops these idiots making money from the millions upon millions shoved into their arses from the last one that everyone went to see (out of curiosity) making them think they did a good job&quot;

Sorry if this seems like Im ranting but damn this person for making me so angry about an hour being taken away from my life. Take my advice DO NOT SEE THIS FILM!!!!!!!!! side effects may be: anger, boredom, constipation, more anger, a large urge to hit the one person saying&quot;that was awesome&quot;(dont hit them, this is probably the first time they have seen a girl in sexy underwear.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What a truly fabulous review! That was a great read - although it&#039;s not going to stop me seeing the film. I was sniggering throughout but the &quot;trying to rationslise it to be less awful&quot; bit got me. Great stuff :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In a perverse and selfish way, I&#039;m glad to hear that the plot in minimal to non-existant, as every time I&#039;ve seen the trailer I&#039;ve been left reeling for a few seconds before spluttering out &quot;But... but what is it &lt;i&gt;about?!&lt;/i&gt;&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was in a real quandry about this - love action heroines, several in one stylish film, how could it lose?  I even kind of liked the 300.  But your review has confirmed my worst fears and I think its best if I just stay away because I will just get angry.  By the way, I will now definitely become a regular visitor to your site!

Damien, my husband tells me Resident Evil: Afterlife might fit your brief http://whatwritesatmidnight.blogspot.com/2011/03/why-i-loved-resident-evil-afterlife.html
and Winter&#039;s Bone, while not an action film, and didn&#039;t exactly make it past the studio script readers, shows just what women should be doing in the movies.]]></description>
