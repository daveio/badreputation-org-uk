					<description><![CDATA[A couple of asides that I didn&#039;t manage to fit into the main body of the post:

Baker stormed out of the Stork Club in New York after being refused service there, and was joined by Grace Kelly, who&#039;d been in the club at the time. The two went on to boycott the place and became fast friends, with Kelly (by this point the princess consort of Rainier III of Monaco) later offering Baker a villa when she hit on hard times.

Baker was also involved in an affair with Frida Kahlo. Jean-Claude Baker&#039;s book details her affairs with other women in the entertainment business, and after it was published it became apparent that Kahlo had also been involved. Which, y&#039;know, is pretty cool.]]></description>
