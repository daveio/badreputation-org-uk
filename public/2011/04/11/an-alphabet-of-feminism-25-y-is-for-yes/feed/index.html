Of course! That was where I first saw it. AND THUS THE SEEDS OF THIS POST WERE SOWN.

The online etymology dictionary seems to be using &#039;ge&#039; and &#039;ye&#039; interchangeably (anglo saxon style), making it a firmly anglo saxon word, but there have been lots of examples (eg &#039;girl&#039;) where a saxon origin seems to have a weird connection with similar words in latin or greek. They got around, no? xxx]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hodge, do you remember I had a postcard of that vd poster on my teenage bedroom wall? (spot now occupied by l for lady. Natch).

Etymologically do you think yes is related to greek (and indeed indo european) ge (land, mother)?? Potentially very spurious but could be forced to work linguistically? Xxxxx]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/04/11/an-alphabet-of-feminism-25-y-is-for-yes/#comment-1010&quot;&gt;Miranda&lt;/a&gt;.

My response to that, Miranda, is &quot;yeah, whatever&quot;.

I think that Joyce is one of those authors one will never read unless one tackles him in one&#039;s twenties.  Now in my sixties, I&#039;m content that I&#039;ll never read him.  I&#039;d rather read Noel Streatfeild, and watch Xena DVDs.

Kafka is another author one will never read unless one tackles him in one&#039;s twenties.  I did read Kafka in my twenties.  I was the only person I knew to think that &quot;Amerika&quot; was his best novel.  I also thought that &quot;The Hobbit&quot; was better than &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.  There may have been no hope for me, even in my twenties!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Regarding the Old English origins of the word as &quot;Gise&quot; or &quot;Gese&quot;, while there is probably no real etymological link, I am reminded of the Irish word &quot;geis&quot; or &quot;geas&quot;, being a sort of magical unbreakable vow with terrible consequences, or a kind of taboo.  So in one sense both the ultimate &quot;yes&quot; and the ultimate &quot;no&quot; as both a positive and negative obligation.  

In fact, given the etymology you give above Hodge, I wonder if there&#039;s not a link?  &quot;So be it&quot; would certainly appear to apply to the Irish &quot;geas&quot; as aptly as the English word &quot;yes&quot;.]]></description>
