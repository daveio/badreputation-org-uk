					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/04/15/further-notes-on-sucker-punch-300-and-ironic-sexy-failure/#comment-1194&quot;&gt;Mary Tracy&lt;/a&gt;.

This was such a nice comment to get! The author&#039;s just got back from being away on holiday so I&#039;ll make sure he reads it - he (Markgraf) is the illustrator. He often illustrates his posts - for more of his work check out his other reviews under &quot;Cinematical&quot; and &quot;Gaming&quot;. 

He&#039;s actually got a postcard set for sale over on our shop page that just went up this month...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I did not find the abuse sections sexy, but then I also did not feel I was being asked to find them sexy. Just cause I can see someone&#039;s pants doesn&#039;t mean I have to sexualise them. In fact just because someone is naked I don&#039;t have to sexualise them. Isn&#039;t that the whole point of the slut walk, that skimpy clothing should not be mistaken for a statement of intent?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sigh. I thought if this was trying for an inner-world story along the lines of &quot;find way out of fantasy maze = physically creeping through the corridors of the asylum&quot; then there was a chance it could have any tension and not just be gratuitous abuse pr0n. But it seems that it fails on acceptable portrayal of women AND any craft of storytelling as well.

Your art reminds me that Peter Mensah has the most incredible face ever, though. (Brilliant as Doctore in the first series of Spartacus, haven&#039;t seen the second yet).]]></description>
