					<description><![CDATA[Interesting post! I was going to write a story on the immediacy of the response and how social media has really changed interactions.  #thingsstarbuckwouldntsay was amazing in how overwhelming and rapid the response was to Katee.  And, there really were some very funny responses.

Still might write it for my blog!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love that she came up with 4 or 5 herself immediately (&quot;I&#039;m 5 pounds away from my goal weight&quot; #thingsstarbuckwouldntsay) and then started re-tweeting everyone who joined in :) Half of whom were guys. What a great spontaneous cultural voice that is!]]></description>
