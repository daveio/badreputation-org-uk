Yes, I loved that, too - it made him completely believable as a person.  Of course he&#039;s confused, of course he&#039;s crap; it worked beautifully to get the audience to empathise with his plight.  Artfully played.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I enjoyed Source Code a lot. I particularly liked that the Jake character was portrayed as determined but frequently ineffective. (Mild spoiler): Yes, he does finally make everything work how he wants it to -- but only after a dozen or so dress rehearsals that end in embarrassing failure! It&#039;s a far cry from the usual action hero perfection.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m too scared to read this because I haven&#039;t seen the film yet and, oh! So like to know as little about everything before I see it!

Sometimes this results in a great surprise. Mostly it results in a situation whereby I say &quot;Dammit. If I&#039;d have watched the trailer I would have realise it was rubbish!&quot;.

I sense good buzz for this though, and I did love Moon. So I will check back in once I&#039;ve seen it!]]></description>
