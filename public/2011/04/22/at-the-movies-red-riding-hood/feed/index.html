Dog Soldiers is absolute climatic gold and I&#039;d defend it to my last breath.  Definitely check it out if you love your monster movies, but especially check it out if you like small-budget, high-skill indie flicks. It&#039;s a beauty.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m impressed you managed to stay awake through this, even inventing my own dimensions for the characters left me in dire need of punching myself in the face every five or ten minutes for excitement.

Strange that I walked out of Sucker Punch but not this, though. I must have been feeling particularly self-punishing that day!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/04/22/at-the-movies-red-riding-hood/#comment-1244&quot;&gt;Lola&lt;/a&gt;.

Lola, I will happily sacrifice an hour+ of my time so that fellow werewolf fans don&#039;t have to sit through what I sat through.  I&#039;m selfless like that.

It&#039;s so sad - there&#039;s no transformation scenes (usually my favourite bit) in this, and the werewolf does look quite fun - he&#039;s big and chunky, but strangely thin in the middle.  Big paws.  Takes people&#039;s arms off.  Sigh.

WHY CAN&#039;T WE JUST HAVE RAMPAGE FILMS ANY MORE.  COME ON, CINEMA.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love werewolf films in the same way as you. I will now not watch this film, I hope you feel that even though you wasted your own time you have saved mine. Bless you. 

On the point of boredom though - I just drift of into another realm in my mind, I would have probably fell asleep!]]></description>
