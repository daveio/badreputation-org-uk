					<description><![CDATA[THOUGHTFUL EDITOR HAT ON

I like this post a lot, but I think boys clubs - in atmosphere if not in the rules - are still pretty common. The Women in Engineering debate, f&#039;rexample, remains a big deal. And my read on his tone is that it&#039;s polite because, like many of us, he&#039;s got some prejudiced friends he needs to persuade - I&#039;ve definitely been there with friends who were much more open to my point when I wasn&#039;t yelling SEXIST ROT EVERYWHERE JESUS at them. This is enormously frustrating in many ways but I think it&#039;s a classic problem which still applies now for many women, hence the frequency of online trolls who go &quot;I just don&#039;t like your TONE&quot;. I think we still don&#039;t like angry feminism in the public sphere. Sometimes it&#039;s frustrating, other times I&#039;m more like, &quot;well, if I can get these people talking via politeness, so much the better&quot;. Depends on what it is I&#039;m talking about- but often more commonly, who I&#039;m talking to. Hard one. 

Hooray, Carl, though! I love his list - Jane Goodall for the win! And I am all for finding the positives where we can, yes indeed. Look at that list! Yes.]]></description>
