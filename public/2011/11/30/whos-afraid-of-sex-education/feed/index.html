					<description><![CDATA[I really enjoyed this article mainly because I grew up in a Lutheran school from K-8 and then went to a public high school. Needless to say it was a definitely shock with all the public displays of affection on campus and I was very scared my first day of school. My sophomore year, I took Honors Bio and they lectured the norm about how everything works. Blah, blah, blah. But I don&#039;t want to hear about how everything works, I want to know how to be save about it. Its like they figure that if they keep us in the dark, we&#039;re not gonna do anything. WRONG. The more you don&#039;t say, the more we go find out from not so reliable sources(aka our peers). Education is key to getting anything across to students. Without talking, nothing gets solved.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Out of all the things children are taught at school, how to have sex is something we as a species generally figure out on our own.  How to have sex safely, how to have sex so all participants have a good time, how to avoid geting pregnant (if that&#039;s feasible with the combination of people involved) - these are much more difficult and potentially risky to learn be trial and error.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hiya! Awesome article, thought I&#039;d add in one bit - 

The Onscenity Network is a relatively new collaboration of academics and activists all fighting against this idea of &#039;sexualisation&#039; - http://www.onscenity.org/

They&#039;ve just had this blogging project published in a special issue of the academic journal Psychology And Sexuality, focusing on the Bailey Review: http://www.onscenity.org/sexualization/

Yay!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll also add these NHS links, though how publicised they are varies from NHS Trust to NHS Trust - but they&#039;re all on Google:
