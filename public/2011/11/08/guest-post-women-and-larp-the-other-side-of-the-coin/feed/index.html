					<description><![CDATA[This is a very interesting and well thought out article.
It might be a little off topic but one thing I notice right off is there is a very clear description near the start about the &#039;game&#039; and &#039;playing the game.&#039;

One thing I have noticed about LARP are there are often two attitudes to it.
One is &#039;game&#039; focussed - the players that see it as just that - a game.
The other is composed of participants who see it more as an &#039;experience&#039; rather than a &#039;game&#039; in the classic sense.

Certainly I have no shame in admitting I am in the latter category, I have little interest in game theory, I am far more interested in atmosphere and story and, while I applaud an ingenious game mechanic, I frankly find the &#039;gamey&#039; aspects of LARP to be jarring and tend to spoil the wonderful atmosphere and plot that can develop.

I think because of this, and because I tend to associate with people of that inclination, I see less of the overt sexism when I am at LARP.  Indeed, I am a professional entertainer and usually only attend LARP for that purpose, these days.  

The &#039;gamers,&#039; however, tend to be more competitive, aggressive, &#039;masculine,&#039; in fact - and many of the male-members of that crowd (because lets remember there are increasingly more women who like the &#039;game&#039; element of LARP,) express that male sense of entitlement, and I have heard of several examples of the shocking level of aggressive sexist behaviour (with violent overtones, though almost never overt violence,) that some of my female friends, who are more into the &#039;game&#039; of LARP, have experienced.

The nature of patriarchy means men often feel threatened and act aggressively if they are insecure and feel &#039;lesser&#039; or &#039;weaker&#039; than women and (painting broad strokes, again ;)  nowhere outside of the football/rugby scene will you find a higher concentration of insecure men than in LARP.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a very interesting topic and both the article and comments have been both sensitive and informative. I am a male LARPer and have been playing for over 10 years now and I have seen a fair bit of sexism at events. 
The first example is a female friend of ours who IC played an exotic dancer. A friend and myself acted as her bodyguards both IC and OOC simply because she felt there could be a genuine risk of being treated inappropriately by some players. Male players often greatly outnumber females and we all know how some men can behave under the influence of alcohol, particularly (and I hate to say it) the less socially adept ones out there. Horseplay and IC banter can quickly escalate into OOC lechery. Luckily nothing bad or untoward happened but the possibility of somebody getting carried away while presented with an attractive woman was a very real one. 
Secondly, the theme of &#039;pulling&#039; at an event comes up quite a lot. In a game where female players are under-represented in numbers, they will undoubtedly attract attention. I know many people meet and become couples at events but there is still a certain level of machismo attributed to successfully attracting somebody at an event. Think about it, lots of men fighting and shouting with testosterone levels through the roof, gluttony and heavy drinking bring out the animal in some people so it&#039;s very important that we either report, actively stop and constantly discourage any sort of antisocial behaviour. Unfortunately you&#039;ll never be able to stop men staring at the attractive beastkin woman in the skimpy costume because that&#039;s going to happen everywhere. On the other hand of the argument, overly provocative behaviour from some female players towards men is a slippery slope especially considering I have met many male players at events who are either virgins, very sexually inexperienced and due to the huge amounts of testosterone flying around, very sexually frustrated.
We need to look out for each other. I know the LARP world is male dominated and that a lot of men are inherently sexist but trust me in saying there are plenty of men out there like myself who absolutely don&#039;t tolerate it. We all have the right to enjoy the games without any fear of prejudice, intimidation and inappropriate behaviour.]]></description>

I&#039;m extremely sorry that that happened to you.  I&#039;d love to be able to say I&#039;m not aware of enough very similar stories to find what you say completely believable.  All I can say is that there are LARPs out there, run by both women and men with a zero tolerance attitude to anything even remotely like your experience.

Any LARP worth bothering with will have a defined policy for dealing with these sort of things, and won&#039;t be at all bothered if someone asks what it is.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Its all true and worse.

Take my experience with the Camarilla (now minds eye society or midnight dance).  After a few years of being treated like a second class citizen, regulated to &quot;girlfriend&quot; roles even though I joined single. Ostracized when I wanted to play something not so so girly.  I got the worst treatment you could ever imagine.

See I met my boyfriend there and we both played.  When the SOB abused me for 4 years.  Going to far as to throw me down stairs and then raped me when I broke up with him?  You would think the community would react poorly to him after that?  Oh hell no.  Despite legal action against my attacker the organization did nothing to keep him from playing.  In fact they shunned me for it.

Now almost 10 years later the entire organization is still in a healthy level of victim blaming.  Imagine my surprise when I went to check it out again and the same damn people were there trying to tell me he&#039;s the nicest guy in the world.  That I need to forget about it.

My advice?  Don&#039;t Larp.  Just don&#039;t.  It may be fun but unless your going to start your own ran by women who know how to deal with real issues just forget ever being treated right.  And gods forbid something truly bad happens to you.  Whatever it is- they will blame you for it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/11/08/guest-post-women-and-larp-the-other-side-of-the-coin/#comment-1921&quot;&gt;Meg&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi,

The &#039;female trader&#039; comment was actually from North5 not myself, but I certainly did say I haven&#039;t seen sexism in larp. And I really am very aware that my perception of it will be vastly less due to male privilege, which is why if I encountered it happening even once or twice to others I would assume it&#039;s much more frequent than I saw.

But I&#039;ve never seen it at all, and I spend many hours in the same room and the same conversations as the women it would happen to. Now I&#039;m *still* going to assume there&#039;s sexism occurring, but (in the context of a system often designed specifically to let anyone adopt any role they like without restraint) it is so rare that I don&#039;t believe it can be associated with Larping as a whole. There will always be individuals, different behaviour in private, and subtle differences in how men treat women due to societal pressures, but for me to make such a bold statement as &#039;I&#039;ve never seen it&#039; means I feel I&#039;ve put the time in and believe I would have come across some just on average if it wasn&#039;t vanishingly rare.

So, apologies if it read as male privilege. I know Miranda has commented before about experienced &#039;healer girlfriend&#039; syndrome and other aspects, but I was really shocked to read Ribenademon&#039;s statements about the overt and extreme speech. Larpers are in my experience mostly a crowd of shy, polite and liberal geeks who wouldn&#039;t tolerate those kind of comments.]]></description>

We thought it would help to get our Sarah C posting on this topic as a sort of conclusion - she has crewed a number of LARP events. We had an unexpectedly lively response to the first post and we thought it&#039;d drop the ball somewhat if the female-identified members of Team BadRep - since we are (some of) the &quot;women in LARP&quot; being discussed - didn&#039;t respond ourselves. We really enjoyed both posts but really felt we&#039;d be missing a trick not to feature women directly talking about these issues - so that&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/11/09/final-word-thoughts-from-a-woman-on-live-action-roleplay/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;gone live today over here&lt;/a&gt;, for anyone following this.]]></description>

We really enjoyed both posts but really felt we&#8217;d be missing a trick not to feature women directly talking about these issues &#8211; so that&#8217;s <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/11/09/final-word-thoughts-from-a-woman-on-live-action-roleplay/" rel="nofollow">gone live today over here</a>, for anyone following this.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I wanted to bring up a brief point in response to a few of the male commentators in this comments thread, and I hope it comes across as helpful rather than harsh. Basically, there&#039;s a lot of &#039;that&#039;s not my experience&#039; and &#039;I&#039;ve never seen that&#039; being said by people.
Whilst it&#039;s really commendable that you would shut down that kind of behaviour and commenting if it did come up in your presence, when you suggest that because it doesn&#039;t happen to you, it doesn&#039;t happen, that is really dismissive of other people&#039;s experiences. For example, Stephen, when you say: 
&#039;This really does not relate to my experience, at all. Do you really think that when a female trader goes round the camps at Maelstrom, her customers treat her differently to her male counterpart? In my experience, the interaction is usually identical&#039; 
your experience as a man is totally different to my experience as a woman, and I&#039;d argue that I&#039;m better placed to spot the sexism and being treated as a woman first because it happens to me, whereas it doesn&#039;t happen to you.

Al, when you say: &#039;if I regularly found the elements you describe in a game, I just wouldn’t play it&#039; that&#039;s a choice I&#039;ve had to make quite a few times, whereas it&#039;s probably something that hasn&#039;t really come up for you. 

That&#039;s not to blame you guys for stuff not happening to you, that would be really unfair, I just think that in order to be the awesome feminist allies you want to be, first of all it&#039;s really important to focus on believing the things that people tell you happen. Because as a straight, white, cis male, privilege means you won&#039;t experience most of it.

We live in a world where we&#039;re often told that women have it all, nothing is sexist anymore, things are all sorted out, etc, and one of the most political acts a feminist man can do is often to believe the women and other people in his life who are telling him that things are not ok.

I wanted to post some links that I thought would be helpful as well, I hope that&#039;s allowed.
