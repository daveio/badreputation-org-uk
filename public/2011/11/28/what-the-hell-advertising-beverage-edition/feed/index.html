					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/11/28/what-the-hell-advertising-beverage-edition/#comment-1962&quot;&gt;Maria&lt;/a&gt;.

I&#039;m in Serbia at the moment being all &#039;foreign-correspondent&#039; for BadRep, and the gender-stereotyping (and hetero-, white, etc assumptions) in advertising here is unbelievable. And we&#039;re not that far from Italy, home of (as far as I&#039;ve seen) the worst genderised adverts in the western world. So sadly I totally agree, we&#039;re quite alike internationally on a scale that makes London look GOOD (there&#039;s a terrifying concept).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve never quite understood why tastes good = unmanly in the eyes of advertisers and some members of the public.  The same standard that applies to alcohol appears to apply to certain foodstuffs as well; anything sweet is &quot;feminine&quot;, despite the fact that both men and women are programmed to enjoy sweet foods.  

If you listened to the marketing, of course, as a man you&#039;d drink nothing but bitter and eat nothing but raw steak, and die at the age of 25.]]></description>
