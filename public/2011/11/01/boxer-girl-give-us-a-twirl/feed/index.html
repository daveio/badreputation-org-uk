Yes, that entire whole bit is just so baffling. It reminds me of the Caster Semenya row a bit because it&#039;s so ludicrous.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[AIBA asked boxers to trial the skirts, which they said would allow spectators to distinguish them from men.

What... I... what?

Thing the first:
I know pretty much nothing about boxing of any sort (although I have seen Million Dollar Baby, and it made me cry so hysterically it took me neartly twenty minutes to stop hyperventilating) but I find it utterly incredulous that the AIBA could possibly believe the fans cannot tell the difference between male and female boxers. At the very least, are bouts not scheduled and signposted, so the fans can literally see who is competing? Shame, shame, shame on you for assuming your fans are that ignorant and/or stupid.
