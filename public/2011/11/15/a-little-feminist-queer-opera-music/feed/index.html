					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/11/15/a-little-feminist-queer-opera-music/#comment-1949&quot;&gt;Vee&lt;/a&gt;.

I definitely recommend Lashings! I had so much fun when I saw them this year. 

Anyone else reading: there&#039;s now only one show on 25 November due to a scheduling conflict at the venue (boo!) - so join us!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Greatly intrigued, newsletter subscribed!! will try and make one of the perfomeances for sure, and drag some vocally inclined friends along with me.

(And also thanks for pointing me to Lashings Of.. too - as a female currently filling the role of baritone, this intrigues me greatly!!)]]></description>
