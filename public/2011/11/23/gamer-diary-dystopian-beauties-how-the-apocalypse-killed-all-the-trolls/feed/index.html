					<description><![CDATA[I would agree if the girl&#039;s weren&#039;t from Subway town, but I think their appearance fits the town very well and really isn&#039;t very questionable.
Subway town on first impression is a very shady town, with the men seeming kinda mobsterish and the ladies seeming kinda whorish.  Their outfits fit the mood of the town and they give you a better impression of what it&#039;s like in Subway town.  But Subway town also seems pretty safe, protected and under control.  No one in the town plans on leaving to go and fight, so there really isn&#039;t a need to dress to fight.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I completely agree, but of course this applies to most other character-based computer games too - and indeed most popular media! Sexist lack-of-realism does not only start after the apocalypse :-)]]></description>
