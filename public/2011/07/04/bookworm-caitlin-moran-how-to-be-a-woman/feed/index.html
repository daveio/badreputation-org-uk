					<description><![CDATA[Just bought this (on my not-very-shiny-as-it-has-a-matt-screen Kindle) and am about halfway through. 

I completely agree on the points here about language. The uses of the &#039;r&#039; word, also the use of various mental health slurs (&#039;nuts&#039;, &#039;crackers&#039; come to mind as as she distinctly wasn&#039;t describing light snacks...) and the description of everyone, all 7 billion of us, as being The Guys. It grates in what is, otherwise, a very enjoyable book with which I identify with about 90% of the time.

Perhaps a little scurrilous; I was very recently talking with someone who has an association with Ms. Moran, he mentioned that &#039;the Cat [he] knows&#039; cares a great deal about language, so I&#039;m all the more surprised that such blatant and egregious examples of exclusionary language are tossed about like salad dressing. 

One other thing (I don&#039;t know how the physical book is laid out, but in the Kindle version, it could be poor editing) that is slightly bothersome is that it switches from the personal to the general with little definition. It took several paragraphs of me thinking &#039;But I HATE weddings!!!&#039; (it seems that the CAPS lock thinking is contagious!) before it dawned on me that she was writing about her feelings on the subject. As if they were universal, which in her life, they might well be. 

Maybe this is why I&#039;ll never manage to write a book...]]></description>
