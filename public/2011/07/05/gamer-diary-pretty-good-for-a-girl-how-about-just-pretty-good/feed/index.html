Clunky isn&#039;t too much of an issue to me as I still play the original DOOM with its &lt;10 square dots per enemy when seen from afar.

Currently working on 3 or 4 new pieces but at least one needs some serious spin so it fits in with BadRep (otherwise it&#039;ll just go up on my blog).  I will return!]]></description>

Thankfully, as I&#039;m quite shy and anti-social, I&#039;ve never yet been required to go on any Teamspeaks nor have I volunteered.  Previously the &#039;clan&#039; I play(ed) with used Skype and that has wonderful typing to facilitate my shyness though I too have a very deep voice combined with a female-ish visage.  To be frank I prefer to remain anonymous mainly because I find gender much more variable than one or t&#039;other, so it&#039;s easier to not have to explain and risk epic discrimination.

Either way, in the event that I actually get round to joining EVE I will be sure to declare it everywhere so I can find friends to help me navigate it all.]]></description>

Apologies, meant to say &#039;gender concealment&#039; there, not confusion. Momentary brainfreeze.]]></description>

I don&#039;t go out of my way to point it out, but I will correct people I actually interact with a lot if they refer to me as male, and in any case non-disclosure of gender only works until you&#039;re needed on Teamspeak. I have quite a deep voice for a woman so gender confusion is possible, but I imagine for many others it isn&#039;t. I don&#039;t want to conceal my gender, anyway, because if people are funny about it I can&#039;t be bothered to play with them and go elsewhere. On EVE this is perfectly possible, and my current corp and its allies just treat me like another pilot. I&#039;ve had a few issues with excessive niceness, which in all bar one case was resolved with a quiet word, but never with a barrage of insults. I hear it happens, and I&#039;m sure it does, but I&#039;m quite picky about my corps with regards to mature attitude, sense of humour and :srs bsns: level, and that does weed the less than pleasant players out.]]></description>

I suspect it might be a bit clunky looked at from today, but It&#039;s still a ground breaking game I will recommend to anyone at the drop of a hat. You can get it for £5 from gog.com.

Putting aside all frothing I&#039;m looking forward to more articles to come here.]]></description>

Now we have further proof that gender stereotyping in gaming is so utterly ridiculous!  Hooray!

Incidentally I do wish I could play more games like Zelda just because I feel I do need more variety sometimes.  Hence why I&#039;ve just been playing leisurely games like The Tiny Bang Story, Spiral Knights and Worms recently.]]></description>

I concur with xkcd (&amp; yourself, of course).

I don&#039;t think it matters on a personal level what type of games one plays - unless you have any friends who enjoy winding you up - but most of the stereotypes seem to occur, with &#039;male&#039; gamers at least, on a much wider, sweeping scale.  In particular from the mainstream media who assume all guys play C.O.D. and all &quot;proper&quot; gamers are guys and all guy-gamers are solitary beasts with no hope of attracting girlfriends (because of course, they must also all be straight).

Excuse the side-track rant, sorry!  My point I was trying to make was that, as you say, it doesn&#039;t really matter what type of gamer you may be because you are who you are and people you know will accept that.  You may still fall foul of generic stereotypes but that&#039;s what we&#039;re here to help disprove!]]></description>

I&#039;m afraid not.  I got into RPGs very late in life and was 10 when Planescape: Torment came out - at that time in life I was still very much a FPS or Age of Empires kid.  If indeed you recommend it, then I&#039;ll try and locate a copy and give it a go :-)

Generally, I must say, my &#039;gaming credentials&#039; tend to be a bit abnormal when assessed by other gamers.]]></description>
