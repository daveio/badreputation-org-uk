					<description><![CDATA[Wow; great take on She-Ra. My own personal take though is a bit different. I brought (as a grown ass adult) both He-Man &#038; She-Ra -- Season 1 (for both) on DVD. As a child, I of course loved She-Ra. But now looking at it, it seems that He-Man had a better written script than She-Ra did. Also outside of the first episode (which explains how She-Ra came to be), I find little affinity for Adora. Her official job was to be the leader of the rebellion. However she doesn&#039;t seem to be very successful at that, in that she always runs off to become She-Ra and the slightest sense of trouble. It just didn&#039;t seem believable that no one questioned that. At least Adam was expected to be a lazy prince &#038; that&#039;s it! Also She-Ra did have a boyfriend of sorts with Sea Hawk -- who she openly fawned over. That was cute.

But yes, I agree that She-Ra was very progressive. Especially when you consider that she developed totally independent from the comics, and was created to be the &quot;girl counterpart&quot; of the He-Man franchise.]]></description>

&quot;He-Man&quot; is a terrible name. They needed a better starting point than MALE PRONOUN HYPHEN NOUN, really, to avoid the issues with She-Ra you&#039;ve just mentioned. Her name is only better cos it goes RAAA at the end, I suspect...]]></description>

Actually, research shows that her name was originally supposed to be He-Ra, tying her even closer to He-Man and referencing the Greek God Hera.  Presumably someone then realised what the &quot;He&quot; in &quot;He-Man&quot; was actually doing and decided to be boringly gender-essential about it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For a cartoon series created to sell toys it wasn&#039;t half bad.  I was absolutely obsessed with She-Ra, dragged my poor mother to the feature-length version which almost killed her and had all the dolls.   And I never believed in She-Ra&#039;s relationship with that Bo dude. I reckon she was more of a lady&#039;s woman myself. 

I liked He-Man as well and had a lot of those dolls, sorry &quot;action figures&quot;, too.  My sister and I have hysterics when we remember how gay that cartoon was. Skeletor was so camp.  The action figures weren&#039;t much better; there was one call &quot;Fisto&quot;.  I can&#039;t help but wonder if someone was having a laugh somewhere.]]></description>
