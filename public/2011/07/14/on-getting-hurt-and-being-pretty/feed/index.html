					<description><![CDATA[[...] On Getting Hurt and Being &#039;Pretty&#039; My dad was a boxer, as was his dad, and his dad before him. My great granddad was, apparently, a boxer who boxed illegally on the streets of Liverpool. Made a good living from it, I hear. My granddad’s house was full of my dad’s boxing trophies, and my dad would point at professional boxers on our TV and claim to have fought them in his youth. I have no doubt that, were I a boy, I would have been encouraged to be a boxer too. (tags: gender body.politics sport) [...]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/07/14/on-getting-hurt-and-being-pretty/#comment-1523&quot;&gt;Agleamandaglow&lt;/a&gt;.

It&#039;s so much more widespread than I&#039;d realised, this attitude. Given the oft-fetishised way women are filmed when they kick ass (action babes etc), I expected some of the &quot;OOOH MATRON!&quot; I had about my boxing. But I was a bit surprised at the fear people had - a colleague who regularly sent her 12 year old son to boxing classes told me I shouldn&#039;t be doing it and that I should stick to &quot;boxercise&quot; - piss off, I thought, I want to spar!

In class, as the only woman, dynamics were interesting. Some men ignored me. Some sparred deliberately dirty to scare me. Some couldn&#039;t stop apologising when they landed a (light, this was sparring) body blow. 

I am definitely scared of breaking things! But I think that&#039;s a reasonable feeling. 

What isn&#039;t reasonable is the family member who said &quot;boxing? I don&#039;t like girls doing bloodsports.&quot; Bloodsports! IT IS LIKE FOXHUNTING :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I understand this - I&#039;m a 27 year-old woman and play rugby. People are amazed and shocked when I tell them. &quot;But you don&#039;t look like a rugby player !&quot; They cry, meaning that I am &#039;pretty&#039; and shapely and free of cauliflower ears or missing teeth. The next reaction is &#039;but you don&#039;t play full contact, do you ?&#039; to which I smile and say that of course I do. They are horrified when they see my bruises. But I love my team and my teammates, who have taught me so much. I know there&#039;s a fairly decent possibility I am going to take some cosmetic damage, especially playing in the forwards which is all about the scrum and the contact. I haven&#039;t thought about what I&#039;d do about it, though, so thank you so much for this post.]]></description>
