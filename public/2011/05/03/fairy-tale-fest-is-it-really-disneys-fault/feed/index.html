					<description><![CDATA[However sexist the conceptions around the fairy tale princess, they seems to retain an appeal to women.  I note this, for example:

&quot;We hope you&#039;ll feel like a beautiful princess in this Fairytale set.&quot;

The marketing is clearly being pitched at women.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sounds like a super week! If you can find it, I remember reading Baba Yaga as a child. It&#039;s a Russian fairy tale. There is the usual wicked step-mother and evil witch, but the moral is a bit more: (a) the little girl is not stupid, and so makes sure she&#039;s prepared, and (b) kindness is repaid. No knight in shining armour in sight!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This week sounds awesome! Analysis of the Disney princesses is particularly interesting for people of my age, who grew up on the second-golden-age stuff (Aladdin, Beauty &amp; the Beast, Lion King), so our love for these films is matched only by our fascination with breaking down the moral messages they conveyed into our impressionable young brains.

Also, is it not rumored that Hailee Steinfeld is to star in a new live-action Sleeping Beauty? I don&#039;t see how you can do a version of Sleeping Beauty that isn&#039;t completely insulting to women (Disney) or utterly squicktastic (hello, original!), but I hope they find something for her to do.]]></description>
