I came across it about a decade ago without even knowing it was Gaiman (who I knew only through Sandman &#038; fairytale retellings), simply drawn in by McKean&#039;s art. 
Now I cannot read the standard superhero fare without going &quot;so?&quot;.

I can recommend to pick this graphic novel up &#038; read it through.]]></description>

I love the way she&#039;s illustrated in that first image, with her hair blooming upwards like a giant flower. She looks faintly unsettling and spooky - just a little bit - which I really like. If you&#039;re not quite human anymore, I think it should be a tad uncanny.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I came across it at exactly the time I wanted punchy obvious superhero fare, and I can see now exactly why it threw me completely. I wasn&#039;t seeing the ways it subverts as the *awesome* things I would if I read it now :) 

That feminism-in-the-worlds-of-Gaiman paper could be AMAZING.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Funny, Black Orchid is one of the few Neil Gaiman works I haven&#039;t checked out already, but this article has certainly increased my motivation to seek it out.  Great article!]]></description>
