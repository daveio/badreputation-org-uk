					<description><![CDATA[Cis people taking a backseat discussing gender and listening to trans people, who have had more reason to explore it from an outside perspective, would be valuable. Unsurprised that she was transphobic based on her quote; 
“In a perfect world, I would not have to be a feminist and gay activist, and I could spend my life discussing H.P. Lovecraft.”

No, because in a perfect world, H.P. Lovecraft wouldn&#039;t exist either, and instead the works of someone who wasn&#039;t a virulent racist and anti-semite would be front and center in sci-fi. But she didn&#039;t care about nonwhite folks, just like she didn&#039;t care about trans folks, so of course she&#039;s happy to &quot;discuss&quot; Lovecraft! 

As a bi nonbinary trans person it is beyond frustrating to see how our selfishness as a group - no matter WHAT that group is - splinter and fracture us against having our issues heard. We need to see how our issues relate to other groups, and really listen to those groups and their members. 

I don&#039;t want to be seen as a woman by someone like her. I don&#039;t want her to assume she knows my life, or why I decided to explore my gender outside what was dictated to me as what I had to be. Because she&#039;s doing exactly what men did to her, in being transphobic. 

RIP I guess, but her legacy was disappointing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, sorry I am late to this, and many thanks for the links.

Regarding the Russ apology, a reason why there is nothing in print is that she had been very ill for many years and wasn&#039;t able to write at all. Had she been producing more work I am fairly sure she would have addressed the issue, because she was never one to duck a controversy. I&#039;m always more annoyed with feminists who still hold the book up as faultless than I am with Russ herself.]]></description>
