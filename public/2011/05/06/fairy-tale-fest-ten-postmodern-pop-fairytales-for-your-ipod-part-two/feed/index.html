Save the elves! 

I had a pair one school year and loved them - all the princesses I dreamed up were never interacting with princes at all. They were too busy going on quests, saving the elves, and rescuing their best friends in a rather might-this-be-latent-bisexuality sort of a way...]]></description>

*flaps around* Oh man, I know an unhealthy amount of them. When I was a kid, my lullabies were always morally dubious folk songs, so yeah. XD
I hope &#039;Willie Taylor&#039; will feature, that song is completely kickass. Strident ladies with pistols ftw!]]></description>

Re: Current 93, that the one with the refrain, &quot;It&#039;s the faaaather of your CHILD!&quot; ? I think I remember hearing that one - have a few friends who own much more of Current 93&#039;s stuff than I do. 

I definitely think it&#039;s an influence on &quot;The Hazards of Love&quot;. That&#039;s a brilliant album (was fantastic live, too), although I think it&#039;s disappointing that Janet becomes the rather passive Margaret. The Queen is awesome, though. When I saw their Hazards of Love gig I was sort of rooting for the queen... she just has more powerful songs and stuff... :D]]></description>

Fairies kidnapping people? I think this may be relevant to your interests. 
&#039;Renardyne&#039;, which I ~think is a song from Ulster originally (although there seem to be a lot of Norwegian versions on YouTube?), and essentially a song about werewolf rape/kidnap. &#039;Cept it&#039;s a were-fox.

Yeah, folk songs are pretty reprehensible. I don&#039;t know ANY that actually involve princessy-type things, not that end well anyway.]]></description>

To be clear: I think the women in Strange are &lt;I&gt;believable&lt;/i&gt;, not necessarily &quot;strong&quot; or the sort of role model I&#039;d want my God-daughter adopting (Ha! employment of pseudo-parental responsibility).

Mind you, I&#039;ve never hidden my love for Paramore - I&#039;m a full on fangirl. As you know, haha, from experience. I own a shirt and everything. :D 

I wish Benjamin Zephaniah and Eliza Carthy had done a whole album together. I think they work really well together. 

I&#039;ve recently started Jonathan Strange, actually! Enjoying it so far... I&#039;m not very far in and haven&#039;t met many women yet but it&#039;s wonderful writing ...]]></description>
