Yes - or the libraries aren&#039;t exactly stocking them in abundance. Or Amazon&#039;s familiar &quot;out of print but maybe one seller has an old edition ... maybe&quot; page turns up. 

I like that you recommend the books at the end anyway, though - even just to generate interest, and so on.]]></description>

It has been interesting, in doing the research on these, to see the patterns in the availability of information. There&#039;ve been quite a few I&#039;ve wanted to write about but just haven&#039;t been able to get sufficient biographical details on, because no one has seen fit to record them. 
This particularly goes for anyone who isn&#039;t a white Western European/American, there&#039;s a serious dearth of sources.]]></description>

Yes - I&#039;ve learned so much from this series, so well done Rob. 

Some of them, like Nellie Bly, seem to have attained fame at the time and then just sort of... slowly been eroded from the public perception of history. Only the suffragettes seem to have stuck, perhaps because they directly *attacked* this very issue. 

We&#039;re having a themed week soon on women and protest which will hopefully illuminate some more historical whatsits!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have to say, the Unsung Heroes series has really made me realise that it&#039;s not the case that women have made less amazing contributions to society than men, but rather that they&#039;ve been ignored.

For the record, I had always assumed that years of oppression had prevented the ladies from having the opportunity to make these kinds of contributions, but now I can see that&#039;s not true either; it&#039;s definitely a case of selective recollection.]]></description>
