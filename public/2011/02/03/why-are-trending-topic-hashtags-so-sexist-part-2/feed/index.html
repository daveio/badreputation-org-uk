Agreed, #areweequals? is ace. Also can be used effectively for sex-politics and race-politics action. Jolly good show!]]></description>

My problem with that (maybe it&#039;s irrelevant) is that people generally have a very poor understanding of what &quot;equals&quot; means.  It&#039;s often taken to mean &quot;the same as&quot; but when applied in a social context it doesn&#039;t mean that at all.  I am equal to my friend Jim, but whereas I work and he doesn&#039;t, he owns a PS3 and I don&#039;t, he likes eggs and I don&#039;t, we are not the same.  The example Helen gives suggests an inequality, but the Monty Python &quot;what if you respect his right to have babies&quot; thing doesn&#039;t necessarily; different characteristics shouldn&#039;t necessarily imply inequality.  

I am willing to accept the possibility that I may be talking nonsense and failing to contribute.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What about #areweequals? which links to a big coalition campaign about to kick off in March. People can share things they are thinking or have seen and means guys can use it too.  

&#039;I changed my outfit today because I knew I&#039;d have to walk past that building site and just can&#039;t be bothered with the comments #areweequals?&#039;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1) Awesome post, awesome comments.
2) @BookElfLeeds rules! She is very cool IRL also.
3) Although I enjoyed #imafeministbecause, I didn&#039;t participate in the hashtag. Not because I&#039;m not, but because I didn&#039;t know what I could say in the remaining characters that could sum up all the injustices, prejudices, loves, wonderfulness etc that comes with being a feminist.

I think a hashtag must allow people the opportunity to personalise it, as you say, but it also must be short and flexible enough to permit lots of different interpretations, like those using it deadpan (like Miranda&#039;s friend) or someone using it in earnest. Also agree that it should be gender flexible like Brave Sir Robin said.

Hacking into another hashtag could be combined: like having #thereisno #normal or #whodwanttobe #normal or #sexism #itsnotnormal

Or you could have #itshouldntbenormal so sort of bouncing off the original?

I&#039;m so glad I found out where the hash key is on my Apple keyboard.]]></description>

Miranda - maybe that&#039;s why it might work, we&#039;d be subverting an anti-feminist trope. Ha!]]></description>

Hmmm. While I think all of our suggestions are obviously open to sarky hijacking and hand-wringing, because that&#039;s the nature of Twitter, I&#039;ve heard &quot;I&#039;m not allowed to&quot; as a direct phrase from antifeminist spouters just a leetle bit too often. &quot;Apparently I&#039;m not ALLOWED to have a joke anymore ...&quot; etc.]]></description>
