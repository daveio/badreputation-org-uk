I think that&#039;s partly where I&#039;m torn - I want a show as focused on comedy as The Daily Show, and this isn&#039;t it. It didn&#039;t even occur to me that it would be an alternative to Question Time on BBC, I hadn&#039;t put it anywhere near that category.

One thing Lauren Laverne said on her twitter when she mentioned this post (and my previous comment read as though I didn&#039;t think she was awesome, but I do, and she saw it, woe, woe) was that she&#039;s not there to be a comedian. She&#039;s there to cover the gaps in arranging a live show.

Which is fine, but then we&#039;re back to the &quot;...no female comedians, then?&quot; question.

Mitchell has been *fantastic* in some of his political columns in print. Really cutting, angry and absolutely right.]]></description>

One of the cool things about Ten o&#039;Clock Live for me has been that it isn&#039;t always just for laughs, though.  Of the two episodes I&#039;ve seen (no TV Licence in the new place) Mitchell&#039;s interviews have been better than - well, pretty much any BBC interview since 2007 (at least).  Laverne really got me when she described the Tories as &quot;destroying the country she loved&quot; (paraphrased).  So far it seems to be balanced with Carr and Brooker as the comedians and Laverne and Mitchell still being funny but with a more hardcore bent to them.  I&#039;m surprised and pleased with how good Mitchell is.]]></description>

Interesting that you&#039;re debating which is the more expendable, Carr or Brooker.  I haven&#039;t watched &quot;Ten O&#039;Clock Live&quot; and, thinking about it, my disinclination to watch has to do with Brooker and Carr.  They present themselves as people with whom I wouldn&#039;t wish to spend time in real life, which leaves me wondering whether I wish to spend time with them on my television.  (Laverne and Mitchell, by contrast, present themselves as people I&#039;d enjoy meeting.)  I hope that the real life Carr and Brooker are very different from the people they purport themselves to be.  (Maybe they are, I&#039;ve seen Graham Norton drinking in a pub, and he seems rather drab in real life.)  But, for me, &quot;do I wish to invite these people into my living room?&quot; remains a significant question.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think Laverne&#039;s material has been terrible. Her delivery is fine, but it&#039;s like the writers have said &quot;She&#039;s not a professional comedian, we don&#039;t need to make her funny.&quot; It&#039;s the first show in a long time where I really noticed the gender imbalance immediately, possibly because of the caustic stage personas of Carr and Brooker. 

I haven&#039;t seen all the eps, but the consensus seems to be that Mitchell is running away with the show (albeit lightweight when it comes to doing interviews). I expected it to be slow in the early days, will have to catch the next one and see if they&#039;ve settled in better yet!]]></description>
