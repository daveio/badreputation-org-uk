Thank you for correcting the O&#039;Sullivan link!

The first piece of nose art on that page (&quot;Baby&quot;) connects neatly with the &quot;infant&quot; entry in this alphabet.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Although figureheads (and aeroplane nose art) often have the look of sexually stimulating images, during a voyage the sailors wouldn&#039;t usually (ever?) see them.  That seems to argue against figureheads serving the function of pin-up pictures.  I think that, to get a really good view of the figurehead, a sailor would have needed to leave the ship and look at her from a dinghy.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Whatever the reason for it the ship is definitely a pretty significant metaphor in culture. There seems to be an unspoken link between the common ocean-voyage-as-journey-into-the-infinite-unknown metaphor (a la Tennyson, Moby Dick, Rime of the Ancient Mariner etc.) and the popular perception of sailors as a breed of men somehow more in touch with their basic animal nature (they&#039;re superstitious! They just want to sex and fight!).

I think Larkin is dryly commenting on this in &#039;Next, Please&#039; (which is also relevant in that it features a figurehead with boobs out):

					<description><![CDATA[Further to my idea that a ship could be “she” because she carries the sailors like so many foetuses in her womb, it occurs to me that a ship disgorges the sailors when she berths.  If I follow the online etymological dictionary correctly, &quot;berth&quot; stems from the same roots as &quot;birth&quot;.  In berthing is the ship-as-mother giving birth?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[On ships = states, one of my favourite etymologies is for &quot;governor&quot; (and, curiously, &quot;cybernetic&quot;), which ultimately derive from the Greek &lt;i&gt;Kybernetes&lt;/i&gt;, or &quot;steersman.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think that one element in a ship&#039;s figurehead is to have a watchful pair of eyes at the prow, looking out for danger.  Consider the eyes traditionally painted on the prows of fishing boats from the Mediterranean http://www.flickr.com/photos/thomasrfletcher/5208488985/to eastern Asia http://funvinyldecals.wordpress.com/2009/11/15/why-should-boats-have-eyes/

Returning to sexualised images, the general idea of ship&#039;s figureheads seems present in aircraft nose art: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nose_art.  See these, http://www.nose-art.net/O&#039;Sullivan.htm for example.  I think that aircraft, as well as, ships have often been referred to as &quot;she&quot;.  And I&#039;ve met people who call their cars &quot;she&quot;.

Here&#039;s another idea, off the top of my head -- could a ship be &quot;she&quot; because she carries the sailors like so many foetuses in her womb?]]></description>
