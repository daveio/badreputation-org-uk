					<description><![CDATA[Hello,

Without doubt the most underrated war time hero.  I would love if you had a copy of the route that was taken on her epic bike journey.  I am a teacher and want to showcase this feet amongst others and contributions if women in war.  It would be awesome if you had such a jsp I could acquire.

					<description><![CDATA[What an insane, amazing story.  Thank you for sharing it.  These kinds of stories don&#039;t get anywhere near the amount of attention they should.  I mean, these exploits rival (if not blow away) any hollywood dude badass story.
What I&#039;m trying to say is, mainstream media, more strong, daring, kickass ladies, please!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great stuff -- I always like reading more on Wake, and seeing her valour brought to the attention of a wider audience.

I read Faulks&#039;s _Charlotte Gray_ a few years back, hoping it might be somewhat based on Wake, as I&#039;d heard, and got deeply frustrated that it featured a rather dull and passive heroine; I&#039;m sure Wake would have... well... not kicked her ass, exactly, but dismissed her from her notice, had a big shoot-out with the Nazis, sabotaged some tanks, blown up some bridges, rescued the victims that Gray was unable to save, jumped out of a plane without a parachute, gone home, pinned another couple of medals to her chest, headed back to France for more crazy gallantry... you know.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There was a film on over Christmas called &#039;Female Agents&#039; which was a (fictionalised) story about 4 female SOE agents on a mission into occupied France.

Not the best film in the world, but worth a watch.]]></description>
