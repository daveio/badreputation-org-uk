I can&#039;t speak for coffee&#039;s &#039;decline&#039;, but I would guess the tea&#039;s connection with Britishness has a large part to play. Which in turn has a lot to do with the East India Company, and lots of the stuff I outline above. But, of course, Seattle was the original home of Starbucks, no? Rum indeed.]]></description>

But of course in America coffee (the nasty water-y lukewarm and filtered stuff) is the common man&#039;s drink what you &#039;ave with your Dunkin&#039; Donuts by the gallon for breakfast and tea is probably considered an effete upper middle-class pretension.

Wouldn&#039;t venture a guess as to why it worked out that way round though.]]></description>

Oh, and if I had to put a date on it, I&#039;d say 1780s... it had definitely reduced in price substantially by the end of the c18th. 

Bit gutted now that I didn&#039;t talk about tea after the enlightenment, cos it&#039;s clearly really interesting (witness all these points that are being raised) but i got so overexcited...]]></description>

I wonder if you could make a sensible argument that coffee has rather overtaken tea as a class divider in modern times? 

...It&#039;s overpriced (while you can certainly get a ludicrously expensive cup of tea, it feels less justified when Starbucks shove you a cup with the teabag floating limply in some lukewarm water and then charge you two pounds, than it does when you&#039;re getting a mochachocaexpressochino with whipped cream and sparkles); 

it can be used to justify some lavish spending (&#039;I can&#039;t drink instant - I must buy an expresso maker / cappuccino dispenser / imported luxury beans (http://www.monmouthcoffee.co.uk/) / whatever else forthwith!&#039; (you can tell I don&#039;t drink coffee, can&#039;t you?)); 

and, finally, its supposed Italian origins facilitate a high level of snobbery and sort of oh-so-cosmopolitan attitude in both the drinker and the advertiser (http://ads.biteus.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/lavazza-billboard_4.jpg).

As opposed to this, you have the near-fabular significance of &#039;PG Tips&#039; as a synonym for cheap tea, and, of course, &#039;builders&#039; tea&#039;, which has now become a recognised phrase (and a recognised way to order tea). I am also, bizarrely, reminded of Adrian Mole wondering why tramps &#039;always ask for money for a cup of tea - don&#039;t any of them drink coffee?&#039; As ridiculous (and funny) as that is, the idea of asking for a cup of tea seems to have acquired a kind of &#039;basic comfort&#039; significance that coffee does not have. 

I suspect that coffee&#039;s rise in modern times began in the 80s (but have no idea why I think that), and that tea&#039;s descent to ubiquity was a result, as you say, of pricing structures changing (something the slave trade probably helped...)]]></description>

Ah, what I meant was, that if &#039;civility&#039; is at its root to do with genteel roman businessmen down the forum, it rather undermines the idea of &#039;civility&#039; as a feminine concept...

Ah, so true. Markgraf&#039;s Tea Snobbery is legendary. He is well schooled in the rigours of teattiquette! One of many reasons why we love him.
