					<description><![CDATA[This might be the funniest bad review I&#039;ve ever read. I read it as I watched the movie, which made it infinitely more enjoyable. It truly was a bad movie, and most of the time I spent going &#039;wtf?&#039;]]></description>

Yes! This! I found that on Google when I was proofing this piece, but whenever I Googled &quot;Styria crusades&quot; it was all links about the armies DEPARTING from Europe. Not stabbing people up IN Styria. 

It possibly explains the snow, though. Maybe? 

This movie sounds so full of holes, though, that I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if the research was just a quick whizz round Wikipedia :D]]></description>

Styria is also a state in Austria. Though that might be a bit out of the way for someone trying to take part in the Crusades.]]></description>
