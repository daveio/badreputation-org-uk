					<description><![CDATA[Thank you so much for this article! I had heard of Nellie Bly before but only tangentially. She was so much more inspiring than I knew.

I can&#039;t wait to read Ten Days in a Mad-House and Around the World in Seventy-Two Days.

I&#039;m really enjoying the Unsung Heroes series :D]]></description>

@Rob, Wikipedia says Air was cancelled last year :( - if you own the trades I might just nick them off you to get an idea of what they&#039;re like :D]]></description>

Well, no, obviously (or at least I would hope it was obvious!) I wouldn&#039;t actually use that title were I working on a project of this sort for real.

If you were to start something like this up in realistic terms, simply creating a gender-flipped outgrowth of Alan Moore&#039;s work wouldn&#039;t be the most original exercise ever, and I think conceptually would need some work to differentiate it. 

Just on the subject of heroines of the last couple of centuries and comics, &lt;a href=&quot;http://roisindubhcomic.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;This emerging comic features a fictional Victorian-era heroine and looks awesome, by the way&lt;/a&gt;. 

ps.&lt;em&gt; I &lt;/em&gt;expose Freud. We know this. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sparksoflight.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/doessomestuff.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Markgraf chronicled it.&lt;/a&gt; /ends in-joke]]></description>

We are NOT calling this the League of Extraordinary Gentlewomen, for three reasons:

1.  The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen were fictional, these women are real (but possibly travelling through time).

2.  The name implies that it&#039;s just a take-off of the male-oriented league. They&#039;re NOT the girl league, they&#039;re their own thing, and should be viewed as such.

3.  Because that name is rubbish and I don&#039;t like it, and I came up with the idea of them fighting crime and exposing Freud together, so nyah.

Any suggestions for better names though?  I&#039;m busy right now and can&#039;t come up with something suitably awesome.]]></description>

Coming soon in this series is a piece on Jackie Cochran, who was possibly even more awesome than Amelia Earhart, but not quite as famous because she didn&#039;t vanish mysteriously.

I&#039;ve read the first two volumes of Air, I think, have they released more yet?]]></description>

Hellen Mirren for Lady Killigrew? She seems to be the current awesome older actress, based on RED and Brighton Rock. Also the League Of Extraordinary Gentlewomen needs the fantastic Russian pilot Ibrina Sebrova, who I need to write about in the near future.]]></description>

Well, this series is going to run to several posts, so wait and see! Also, we might well take suggestions if anyone wants to send them in - badrepeditors@gmail.com ... 

Lady Killigrew is also a good addition to any League of Extraordinary Gentlewomen, in terms of including older characters, because she did her most famous piratical acts when she was sufficiently advanced in years to be played in a movie by Judi Dench or somebody like her. 

If I were putting a group together I&#039;d be voting for Sojourner Truth. She was amazing - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/sojourner.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Hodge made fanart of her &lt;/a&gt;when she was doing the Alphabet&lt;/a&gt;. Also Harriet Tubman - when I discovered a book about her in my primary school library I was blown away. 

ps. The pirate posts will soon return! It&#039;s a series of five pirate women, so stay tuned for that, as Lady K will soon have company :D

pps. I would totally draw a comic series that featured these women. Although I&#039;m already committed to draw two other projects at the mo - one&#039;s a short 10 page number and one&#039;s a longer project I&#039;m working on with the author of this post, in fact! But we should chat :D]]></description>

Okay, so, counting the pirate lady (because all superhero teams should have a pirate, dammit) we have Lady Killigrew, Nancy Wake and Nellie Bly so far.  Who else belongs here? Obviously BadRep has featured a number of women (ha ha) but I think the requirement here is that they be historical in some way. 

I WILL WRITE IT IF YOU WILL DRAW IT. Y/Y?]]></description>
