Yeah, it does feel like baby steps in so many ways. I was glad they were reading, though. 

This was interesting too: &lt;a href=&quot;http://borderhouseblog.com/?p=4161&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Borderhouse blog on Halo: Reach writer Tom Abernathy admitting that Halo is &quot;not serving half our audience&quot;&lt;/a&gt;.

Yeah, we saw the &quot;actually it&#039;s intended to be a male assassin&quot; thing. We thought we&#039;d go ahead with this post and recognise that they showed a willingness to engage when they could easily have ignored us. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s cool that Ubisoft notices their fans&#039; opinions, if more companies did that it would syphon down to the quality of their products.  Sadly though, it doesn&#039;t really do anything about most of the women, especially in the historical pieces of the game, are there purely as eye candy (though I checked up on the Caterina Sforza link you put and she sounds f**king awesome).  And on a rather embarrassing note it turns out the assassin picture they put on the website was actually male.  So much for addressing concerns.  Even if they did put the artbook chockful of realistic non-sexualised ass-kicking assassins, if the games, which are their main media, don&#039;t feature any then it&#039;s really all for nought, as as well as the artbook might sell it still isn&#039;t the face of the game. 
And Rebecca is pretty sweetm it&#039;s nice to see a female character that&#039;s tach savvy.  That and the modern assassin groups as a whole, Lucy&#039;s the boss who saves the &#039;hero&#039; from asbergo,  Rebecca&#039;s the tech who allows Desmond to do all his historical ass-kicking and Wallace is the historian.  It&#039;s a pretty good dynamic, just a shame it wasn&#039;t carried over into the historical settings.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congratulations on getting a link from Ubisoft Workshop. :)

If you like the modern-day parts of Ass Creed, you&#039;ll definitely enjoy Ass Creed: Bro Ho. I agree with you that Lucy and Rebecca are cool characters. It&#039;s just a shame that the main character Desmond is about as bland as a cardboard and water sandwich.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was really damn impressed that Ubisoft Workshop linked back to us in such a friendly way. 

It can be a scary thing to mount feminist critiques of games/fandom sometimes, or at least it can feel that way; in a franchise that inspires this much love, fanart, and general gusto it can be easy to upset people! I had my +++anti-trolling moderator armour on when the last post went up, but people have reacted well and debated really engagingly. So re: &quot;And especially don’t rule it out where the Brotherhood can get to you&quot; - I think if people shout about what they care about, maybe one day soon enough people will make a difference. So don&#039;t rule it out, but definitely &lt;em&gt;make your voices heard.&lt;/em&gt; It was cool to hear them describe your callouts as &quot;important issues&quot;. 

I think it&#039;s great that the team at UbiWorkshop gave us that link; by doing so they are actively dialoguing with us as fans, and that rocks, and gives me hope for the future, and makes everybody feel a bit better all round. Yeah!

ALSO ALSO I want loud green sneakers now. 

ALSO A HORSE]]></description>
