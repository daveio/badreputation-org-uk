<p>So it turns out that the Brotherhood really <em>are</em> watching you.</p>
<p>I rolled in to work today, sleep-deprived and with a quiff resulting from three days&#8217; worth of hair product build-up, to find that <a href="https://ubiworkshop.myshopify.com/blogs/news/2653802-home-made-assassin">the Ubisoft Workshop had linked to my previous post about sex Assassins</a>.</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;ve told you previously that the <strong>Assassin&#8217;s Creed</strong> franchise is my opiate. As anyone who has met me can confirm, the mere brush upon the subject of the games is enough to send me into a dreadful foam. My boss&#8217;s son, a kid of only 11, paled when subjected to my enthusiastic anecdotes of dumping masses and masses of dead guards into haystacks. I&#8217;m <em>stupid</em> over it.</p>
<p>Imagine my delight, then, when I found out I&#8217;d been linked to by the <em>Ubisoft Goddamn Workshop!</em> Imagine the shrieking. Imagine the foaming. Imagine the looks on my poor, long-suffering co-workers&#8217; faces as I explained the situation to them in what increasingly became a sort of hyperactive semaphore. Ubisoft Workshop!! Where most of my paypacket goes each month! Where you can, for the princely sum of five Canadian dollars, order a copy of the spin-off comic <strong>Assassin&#8217;s Creed: The Fall</strong> and have it arrive on your doorstep in an Ubisoft envelope <em>and then die of glee.</em></p>
<p>You know, hypothetically. Er.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m pretty chuffed. But I think, therefore, that&#8217;s it&#8217;s time to iron out a few kinks and go into the depth I couldn&#8217;t plumb in my first article because I had a wordcount to stick to and a point to make. Ready? Good. Let&#8217;s go.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p>I still haven&#8217;t played <strong>Assassin&#8217;s Creed: Brotherhood</strong>, yet. I know, <em>I know</em>. I&#8217;m spewing all of this from the stand-point of someone who&#8217;s mashing contentedly through <strong>Assassin&#8217;s Creed II</strong> like a boss and is wondering whether or not we&#8217;ve been treated to a better representation of women in the next one.  Reasonable, no?</p>
<p>My boyfriend, bless him, bought me the Extra Super Mega Ultra Holy Shit A Box Edition of <strong>AssCreed BroHo</strong> for Christmas, and in the extremely ostentatious box, you get picture cards of all the character classes! After wrenching myself down off the ceiling, I was extremely pleased to note that quite a few of the classes that you get to spew forth into the throats of Templar Scum are indeed ladies, and not all of them are courtesans. This is good. We have a nice library of stabby-bastard women to chose from, and they&#8217;re believably solid and real-looking, and I&#8217;m totally convinced that they could fuck guards and Templars up just as well as everyone else you&#8217;re given to play with.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also had fellow Screed Freaks telling me that, it&#8217;s okay!  <strong>Brotherhood</strong> is awash with gender equality and I&#8217;ll love every minute of it (what am I, some kind of gender equality bomb?) (no wait, that is EXACTLY what I am) &#8211; but the Assassins you recruit and send on missions aren&#8217;t characters in their own right, are they? These are wordless, voiceless pawns that you fling merrily into the faces of your enemies. The female <em>characters</em> in Screed are still looking rather few and far between.</p>
<p>There are a few bit-parts in the historical Animus sections in <strong>Assassin&#8217;s Creed II</strong> (I&#8217;m sorry, people who haven&#8217;t played the game; you&#8217;re just going to have to keep up) and there certainly appears to be a recurring theme of everyone shagging Ezio.  Which, I&#8217;m going to have to admit, I would (he probably likes boys too, right?) but it is really amazingly prevalent.  That said, there <em>are</em> a couple of female characters in <strong>Assassin&#8217;s Creed II</strong> that delighted me <em>out of my fucking tree</em>. I was deeply heartened to see <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caterina_Sforza">Caterina Sforza</a></strong> and was even more heartened to see that her backstory&#8217;s in the database. She&#8217;s brilliant! Her story is at once completely heroic and deeply upsetting, and I&#8217;d begin a rant right now about how many strong, independent women in history and fiction have often run the risk, or faced the reality, of sexual assault at some point or other, but I think that&#8217;s an axe we all have to grind (right?).  But yes; she&#8217;s <em>intense</em> and I&#8217;m really glad she&#8217;s in the game with as much face time as she gets, because now a whole generation of people will know about her who may not have done previously.  Yes!</p>
<p><strong>Rosa</strong>, a bit-part thief in&#8230; the Venice section, if I recall correctly, has the potential to be amazing, too &#8211; but this is undermined somewhat by the fact that the first time you meet her? you have to rescue her. I mean, come on. The only person I want to see Ezio rescuing, knight-to-the-aid-of-a-damsel-style, is Leonardo. But that&#8217;s probably just me.</p>
<p>The main characters that we get to see actual progression and agency from &#8211; and not just flavour &#8211; in are the ones that aren&#8217;t in the historical sections. I&#8217;m talking <strong>Lucy Stillman</strong> and the fucking brilliant <strong>Rebecca</strong>, and I was a little bit sad that <strong>Assassin&#8217;s Creed II</strong> gives us far fewer outside-the-Animus sections for us to enjoy her in! I want a spin-off game of just her, kicking people in the face (which she notably never does) and forming emotional attachments to machinery.</p>
<p><strong>Assassin&#8217;s Creed II</strong> does some things wrong (it&#8217;s quite a lot like a courtesan-and-victim smorgasbord, and anyone arguing that &#8220;<em>that&#8217;s</em> what women <em>were</em> in those days!&#8221; will get an internet punch, because they weren&#8217;t and to assume otherwise is <em>stupid</em>) and some things right (REBECCAAAAAA, REBECCA I LOVE YOU REBECCAAAA, SHAUN AIN&#8217;T GOT NOTHING ON ME, REBECCAAAAA, etc.), and is <em>certainly</em> doing a whole lot better than the first game, which had Lucy and Maria, the Robert du Sable cosplayer and&#8230; well, that was that.</p>
<p>And then <strong>Brotherhood</strong>, apparently, does it all better <em>again,</em> and I am deathly excited to see how, given the mixed success of the previous games. This franchise, as I will shout until I&#8217;m blue in the face to anyone who&#8217;ll listen, is one that&#8217;s going from strength to strength and is (perhaps most importantly) the child of people who give a shit about representation and who&#8217;s playing their game &#8211; as my previous article getting picked up on shows. I just wanted to reassure you that <strong>Assassin&#8217;s Creed</strong> isn&#8217;t a franchise swamped and blinded by the Frank Miller Effect wholesale. Don&#8217;t rule it out. And especially don&#8217;t rule it out where the Brotherhood can get to you, <em>because they will</em>.</p>

<p>I was really damn impressed that Ubisoft Workshop linked back to us in such a friendly way.</p>
<p>It can be a scary thing to mount feminist critiques of games/fandom sometimes, or at least it can feel that way; in a franchise that inspires this much love, fanart, and general gusto it can be easy to upset people! I had my +++anti-trolling moderator armour on when the last post went up, but people have reacted well and debated really engagingly. So re: &#8220;And especially don’t rule it out where the Brotherhood can get to you&#8221; &#8211; I think if people shout about what they care about, maybe one day soon enough people will make a difference. So don&#8217;t rule it out, but definitely <em>make your voices heard.</em> It was cool to hear them describe your callouts as &#8220;important issues&#8221;.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s great that the team at UbiWorkshop gave us that link; by doing so they are actively dialoguing with us as fans, and that rocks, and gives me hope for the future, and makes everybody feel a bit better all round. Yeah!</p>
<p>ALSO ALSO I want loud green sneakers now.</p>
<p>ALSO A HORSE</p>

<p>Congratulations on getting a link from Ubisoft Workshop. :)</p>
<p>If you like the modern-day parts of Ass Creed, you&#8217;ll definitely enjoy Ass Creed: Bro Ho. I agree with you that Lucy and Rebecca are cool characters. It&#8217;s just a shame that the main character Desmond is about as bland as a cardboard and water sandwich.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s cool that Ubisoft notices their fans&#8217; opinions, if more companies did that it would syphon down to the quality of their products. Sadly though, it doesn&#8217;t really do anything about most of the women, especially in the historical pieces of the game, are there purely as eye candy (though I checked up on the Caterina Sforza link you put and she sounds f**king awesome). And on a rather embarrassing note it turns out the assassin picture they put on the website was actually male. So much for addressing concerns. Even if they did put the artbook chockful of realistic non-sexualised ass-kicking assassins, if the games, which are their main media, don&#8217;t feature any then it&#8217;s really all for nought, as as well as the artbook might sell it still isn&#8217;t the face of the game.<br />
And Rebecca is pretty sweetm it&#8217;s nice to see a female character that&#8217;s tach savvy. That and the modern assassin groups as a whole, Lucy&#8217;s the boss who saves the &#8216;hero&#8217; from asbergo, Rebecca&#8217;s the tech who allows Desmond to do all his historical ass-kicking and Wallace is the historian. It&#8217;s a pretty good dynamic, just a shame it wasn&#8217;t carried over into the historical settings.</p>

<p>Yeah, it does feel like baby steps in so many ways. I was glad they were reading, though.</p>
<p>This was interesting too: <a href="http://borderhouseblog.com/?p=4161" rel="nofollow">Borderhouse blog on Halo: Reach writer Tom Abernathy admitting that Halo is &#8220;not serving half our audience&#8221;</a>.</p>
<p>Yeah, we saw the &#8220;actually it&#8217;s intended to be a male assassin&#8221; thing. We thought we&#8217;d go ahead with this post and recognise that they showed a willingness to engage when they could easily have ignored us.</p>
