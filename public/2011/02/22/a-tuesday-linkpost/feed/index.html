Definitely an unsung hero, yeah. She was Edwin Lutyens daughter, I think. Her concert music is cool: progressive but also idiosyncratic, and she was way ahead of her establishment (and, of course, male) contemporaries like Walton (bear in mind that until Benjamin Britten started to become well-known in the 40s/50s, most of English music was desparately trying to pretend that modernism wasn&#039;t happening).

From the pop culture perspective the Hammer Horror stuff is cool because horror films are the perfect vehicle to get more challenging and modernistic music out there in the mainstream. The Skull in particular is cool, and I strongly recommend the film anyway for the height of Hammer barely coherent, campy schlock.]]></description>

Oh wow, I saw her name and thought &quot;I wonder if she&#039;s descended from Edwin Lutyens&quot;... and Wikipedia has now informed me that she is! 

... I&#039;ve no idea why I think that&#039;s awesome but I do.

I think I&#039;m going to explore her work more now. Thanks for the tip! She sounds like a bit of an Unsung Hero, actually. *goes to nudge the Unsung Heroes feature writer*]]></description>

The gaming one set me off, but in lots of things, in lots of ways.  I love &quot;mainstream&quot; superhero comics but feel quite shaken whenever there&#039;s a &quot;women in refrigerators&quot; moment, because it&#039;s not who I am and not what I want to see, but the mediums themselves, the notion/lifestyle of &quot;geek&quot;, is.  I just feel let down.]]></description>
