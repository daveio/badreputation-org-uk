					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/06/17/spraying-links-about-the-place/#comment-1461&quot;&gt;Russell&lt;/a&gt;.

I think it was always going to get huge attention simply because it was so long in the making, but people used to *like* the series. 

It was as un-feminist as having Arnie shoot things while making wisecracks, or quoting &quot;They Live&quot; endlessly, but it wasn&#039;t grossly offensive. This one really is - not humourously crude, not ironic, not a pastiche of outdated macho-ness, just really disturbing and horrible. And it&#039;s nice to see that&#039;s not being tolerated (alongside the fact that the gameplay is also rubbish).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As near as I can tell, Duke Nukem Forever is essentially receiving the attention it has because it&#039;s a disastrous example of how not to make a game.  14 years plus &quot;development&quot; time, outdated gameplay, outdated graphics, humour that was outdated when they started making the damn game, etc.  All of which leads me to conclude it&#039;s simply not worth worry about - they dropped the ball years ago.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Every single review of Duke Nukem has been that scathing. My favourite is here. It&#039;s just relentless. 

http://www.destructoid.com/review-duke-nukem-forever-203658.phtml

&quot;Duke does not come across as cool, witty or likable in the least. He comes across as a vile, callous, thoroughly detestable psychopath.&quot; &quot;Duke Nukem Forever is a festering irrelevance with nothing to offer the world. It&#039;s a game with an odious personality, one that could only endear itself to the sociopathic and mentally maladjusted.&quot;

They&#039;re not holding back :) I think it&#039;s especially great that major reviewers are calling 2KGames out on the misogynistic aspect of it.]]></description>
