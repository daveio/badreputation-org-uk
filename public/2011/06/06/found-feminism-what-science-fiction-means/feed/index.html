Aaaactually the sequence of events is this:

A guy who knew someone in that SF/F club posted the logo to Reddit, asking for reworks. I, and several other people, did just that for the hell of it. Mine seemed to be the winner; I sent my image off to the folks in the club with a note that I&#039;d love to have a copy of the shirt and never heard anything back. I posted it on my site; five months later Warren Ellis linked to it.

So quite literally the club, or SOMEONE involved with the club, put out a call on the Internet and asked people to rework it. Whether or not the leaders of the club at the time knew of or approved this, I have no clue.]]></description>

Just a note to say Egypt Urnash has a much bigger website now, and a comic due out! Hooray! 

http://egypt.urnash.com

(And that she uses female pronouns, not &quot;he&quot;: http://egypt.urnash.com/about.html )]]></description>

Thanks for that!

We were paraphrasing Urnash&#039;s description here: http://egypt.urnash.com/Illustration/shark-sf

While I hope no one is making money off someone else&#039;s design in a way that has disadvantaged anyone, the artist describes it as &quot;pro bono&quot;. Although selling shirts of the design would not of course be &quot;for free&quot; unless they were for your society, I thought they were?

I love the art and the concept drawing - has anyone from Simmons approached Urnash about it?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey! I&#039;m one of the members of this college Science Fiction and Fantasy club that originally came up with the concept of this logo. Unfortunate the facts are all wrong here. We did not hire him to redo our logo. In fact he literally just find our logo online and fell in love with it, so he decided to redo it. I think his rendition is awesome but we had no idea of this artist&#039;s existence. Here&#039;s the original design. http://simmons.collegiatelink.net/images/W170xL170/0/noshadow/Organization/f82569f419dd436e968459068a006653.jpg]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I can envision Laser Shark Girl as a Tank Girl companion.

I hear the British Library&#039;s &#039;Out Of This World&#039; exhibition has a few thoughts on feminism in Sci-fi (I know they&#039;ve managed to tie the Bronte&#039;s in with the likes of War of The Worlds). I certainly hope so.. shall find out for myself in a couple of days time!]]></description>
