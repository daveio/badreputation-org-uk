					<description><![CDATA[HAs anyone stopped to think that maybe the reason why Morgana is ALWAYS played as a &#039;Witch&#039; is that, in reality, she was a powerful female Queen and, Mallory, being a bloody man, didn&#039;t like it.

I personally like Morgana or Morgan Le Fay or Morgan or whatever she&#039;s called. She kicks ass and gets up to no good but she spots the rot in Arthur&#039;s Utopian little happy gathering and exploits it. Thats what women do. We spot the rot.]]></description>

Your throwaway comment about Robin Hood led to me watching &quot;Bear Necessities&quot; &quot;I wanna be like you&quot; and &quot;Everybody wants to be a Cat&quot; on youtube, so I forgive you :)]]></description>

As a Sir Gawain nerd (um, in a medieval literature sense at any rate) I&#039;ve always been disturbed by how beardy he is in Excalibur!  

I have no idea why. It&#039;s not necessarily inaccurate (I&#039;ve just seen too many Pre-Raphaelite prettyknights(TM), but I&#039;ve never seen him as that strapping and booming! His speaking lines are few, too. The beard absorbed them all, or something.

Anyway, back to the feminist lens: Helen Mirren is great fun in it, and really is the only woman in the story with much going for her at all - poor old Guinevere and Lancelot have a forest romp and wake up with Excalibur (or A Sword, at any rate) lying on the grass between them. OMINOUSLY.

					<description><![CDATA[I feel so sorry for Stephen.  A throwaway comment about Robin Hood has got more responses than the actual subject matter of the article.

Anyway, I&#039;m a sucker for Arthurian swords and sorcery nonsense, but, on the best evidence, had always assumed film versions of the legends I love were s**t.  However, having read this review, I might now check it out - whilst keeping the part of my brain that absorbs messages about gender switched firmly OFF.]]></description>
