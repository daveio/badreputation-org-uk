					<description><![CDATA[That video is brilliant.  It really sums up the way I feel, and the way I think men should feel, about this particular subject. 

To answer your question about an alternative to appealing to masculinity, the only ways that I can think of to do it would be to disparage or cast masculinity in a negative light, which I doubt would be received well by the target audience.  The problem is that we need to make people revise their ideas of masculinity and I can&#039;t think of a way to do that other than to associate the perceived positive qualities of being male with the message that that shouldn&#039;t disparage women.  Of course, the video just shows men being dumb, which is nicely amusing without necessarily being a peculiarly male trait (do Jackass etc ever actually have female participants?).]]></description>
