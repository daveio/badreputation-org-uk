					<description><![CDATA[[...] SlutWalk: Where Are We? We had a march that very morning about this, didn’t we? Women marching, unified by their contempt for the assumption that they are somehow to blame for their own assault and victimisation. A Facebook event was made, and it ballooned! We had a whole march! And do you remember the John Snow Pub gay kissing incident and all the clictivism that happened for that? Hundreds of people kissed all over the pub in defence of those kicked-out guys. And that’s brilliant. But where are we? Where is the mass anger and outrage for the trans* people? It’s still the Seventies for us in many respects. The internet-based feminist communities are slowly but surely opening their arms to us, but we’re still widely invisible.  (tags: sexual.harassment trans)    LikeBe the first to like this post.

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/06/21/slutwalk-where-are-we/#comment-1469&quot;&gt;Markgraf&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks.

I don&#039;t often talk about this stuff.

Its being where I lived made it much worse than (say) the incident at Kennington station a few years before.  (A gang bashed my head against the wall, then kicked me while I was unconscious.)

And different strands connect.  As a weird person, I had a lot of employment difficulty.  Which meant that I was in low paid work in London.  So, I couldn&#039;t afford private rented accommodation.  Nor could I afford to commute into London.  And leaving my job and moving elsewhere would have meant that I couldn&#039;t have claimed jobseeker&#039;s for six (or was it eight?) weeks.  Not an option.  So I was stuck where I was until my social landlord rehoused me.

Some of the pain (one way and another) has found its way into my books (especially &quot;Tuerqui&quot; and &quot;Margaret Again&quot;).]]></description>

It disgusts me on a very basic level, and I&#039;m continually amazed at how ingrained and ignored transphobia is.  I&#039;m sorry you had to ever have a year like that, ever.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m afraid that I would be one those failing to attend the trans march.

Back in the 90s, I was a very visible trans person.  Then, I was set upon by about eight thugs just round the corner from where I lived.  After a few weeks, my face looked more or less human again.  It took longer for my arm to mend.  But the trauma continues to take its toll, even now.  I don&#039;t think it helped that it took about a year to be rehoused.  (About a year, and a lot of effort on both our parts and that of a lovely caseworker from PACE.)  I really wouldn&#039;t wish to live through that year again... bricks through the window, shouted abuse on the street, and so on...  My feeling is that I did my bit, and now it&#039;s someone else&#039;s turn (if they want it).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am really sorry to read that, on what should have been a brilliant and equalising day, once again some self-appropriated wanker decided his &quot;fun&quot; was above your right to self. More than that I&#039;m sorry that I missed that outfit - from your picture I can only guess you looked completely awesome! Thank you for this post.]]></description>
