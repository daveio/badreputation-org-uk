I advocate the series over all else, really.  The movie is great, but only really works after you&#039;ve seen the series.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wanted to watch this when I was fifteen, seeing as I was obsessed with Sailor Moon and Magic Knight Rayearth. But the series never made it to my country.

Also, can I credit Sailor Moon for making me feminist? Not strictly true, but I loved it so much.]]></description>

The movie is basically the 40 episodes of the TV series, squashed into 90 minutes, with at least 50% more weirdness and 30% more hair. Some of the plot and characterisation is fairly different. Do watch it, but I would suggest not watching it first. It might be quite hard to understand as a first view of the Utena phenomenon.]]></description>

Yes, that&#039;s something we must fix or we&#039;ll literally die.

That&#039;s the Better Myths one anyway. 

I want to watch more Utena. I&#039;ve seen the first couple of episodes where it&#039;s just starting to lay out the plot but it was late at night at your place and I only watched the first two! Must sort that.]]></description>

I repeat my question:

Would the movie make a good first sampling of Revolutionary Girl Utena? Or do we need to see the original series?]]></description>
