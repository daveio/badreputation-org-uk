					<description><![CDATA[Ah, 3 games close to my heart.

I loved Saint&#039;s Row 2 - I especially liked how they recorded different VO/cutscenes depending on your gender, without ever making the female avatar less hardcore (as far as I could tell.)  I changed genders toward the end of a game, and I loved that the other characters noticed.  I also liked the little nod to character customization at the beginning; you meet Johnny Gat, your #2, and his reaction is &quot;You look different... did you get a haircut?&quot;

Saints Row 3 is coming out soon, and I&#039;m just hoping that it deals with gender half as well.

I was bought Brink before I knew that it wouldn&#039;t be including female characters, and I was bitterly disappointed when the news broke.  The game is really quite good, but the failure to include women makes me disappointed the entire time that I play.  It ties in with my constant disappointment in Team Fortress 2&#039;s lack of gender diversity - which bothered me less before they started doubling down with the &quot;Mann Co&quot; store, further reinforcing the &quot;men only&quot; messages that the game is full of.  There&#039;s a great article by ChemicalAlia on making women for TF2 here:
http://www.gamecareerguide.com/features/854/the_aesthetics_of_unique_video_.php?page=1
And her female TF2 skins are available here:

I hope we eventually get a solution for Brink.  If you want a very clever shooter/murder game that does have excellent gender representation, I heartily recommend The Ship - it&#039;s a little dated, but I still hop on to a server from time to time:
http://store.steampowered.com/app/2400

And Portal 2, is Portal 2, and is generally excellent :V

Oh, and a recent study tips the numbers on gender proportion even further to the female:
