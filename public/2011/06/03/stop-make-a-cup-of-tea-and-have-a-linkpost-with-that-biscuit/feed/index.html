It&#039;s do-able, you just have to add target=&quot;_blank&quot; into the a href tag of every link. The control panel doesn&#039;t include that by default, so it&#039;d have to be done manually.]]></description>

It is as simple as right clicking, but most sites I use open in new tabs, so I forget and when I do I&#039;m already halfway to a new site. :( If it can&#039;t be done it&#039;s hardly a big deal but I just thought I would bring it up in case anyone else feels the same way.]]></description>
