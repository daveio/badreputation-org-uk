					<description><![CDATA[Great post! I used to marshal when I was a teenager (oh my - twenty years ago!) - firstly in the paddock getting drivers organised and then out on circuit when I was over 18 (going away to uni mostly scuppered my love of the early-morning scent of bacon butties and petrol, though). Thoroughly enjoyed it and I&#039;m pleased to see the numbers of women involved going up; there were barely any of us back then. Maybe half a dozen on the whole circuit, if you include off-circuit and scrutineers too. One of the few places you never had to wait for the loo! Running with an extinguisher really makes you fit, too! Enjoy, it is awesome.]]></description>
