He apparently did a whole christmas album - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho,_Ho,_Ho - which I&#039;d either forgotten or hadn&#039;t fully taken stock of when I wrote the post!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just rediscovered this post via a Twitter link. Amusingly, we have The Muppets&#039; Christmas album on in the office right now, so I&#039;ve just heard Miss Piggy&#039;s version. Loved it! I had no idea that RuPal had done a cover though :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/12/07/christmas-songnerd-santa-baby/#comment-1990&quot;&gt;Ludi&lt;/a&gt;.

I&#039;ve listened to it a few times now and I&#039;m still bemused by it, but I love bemusing covers so in a way I&#039;m glad it exists. 

In the original sexual undertones are heavily implied because the listeners are already steeped in the idea of feminine beauty as a source of... economic bargaining power? The heroine reminds me of a few cinematic characters; I was chatting to our Sarah J yesterday and she mentioned Marilyn Monroe&#039;s character in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (released the same year as Santa Baby) who at one point says &quot;Don&#039;t you know that a man being rich is like a girl being pretty?&quot;.

Anyway, this whole discourse is woven so heavily through the song&#039;s entire lyrical structure that when Buble&#039;s version tries to remove all that stuff and replace it with “good clean boy&#039;s fun”… it just sort of leaves a suggestive void which immediately had me listening &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the harder for the implied flirty bits!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow. That&#039;s... amazing. In Buble&#039;s mouth, all the... kinda icky kinda sorta kinky kinda ageplay-ish stuff is really accentuated: I had visions of him here as some small subby boy. With Kitt&#039;s version, the main theme seems to be the gold digger: it feels like the subbiness, virginity, and ageplay elements are just so normal that they&#039;re not noticed. 

Buble raptors! I couldn&#039;t read the Buble bits out to my lover for crying with laughter too much : )]]></description>
