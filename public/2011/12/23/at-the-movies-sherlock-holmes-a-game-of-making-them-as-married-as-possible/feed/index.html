I would wear that dress.  Just saying.  It&#039;d be a sartorial &lt;i&gt;event.&lt;/i&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[tbh I think Irene&#039;s bustle may count as a reason not to see the film. I mean... magenta!? WHY? (I may or may not have spent the first half hour horrorfacing over the dress, ahem.)
Still, the living incarnation of the Kate Beaton Pony made up for it. Ponies make EVERYTHING better. 

Anywho, spiffy review as always. :{D]]></description>

I&#039;m definitely taking my boyfriend along, and seeing if I can engineer myself a third trip after that.  I mean, I&#039;d wait until the DVD release, but that&#039;ll be ages, and I really think the effects benefit from huge-ass screening!]]></description>
