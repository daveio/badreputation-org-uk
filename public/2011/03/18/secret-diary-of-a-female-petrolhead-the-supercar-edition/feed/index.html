&lt;i&gt;Maybe the solution to this is to stage a stealth takeover by encouraging lots of awesome feminists to buy them? Except probably they could use their money on more important things.&lt;/i&gt;

I like your solution. The problem is that the people that are rich enough to afford supercars are almost all male (and the few females are not terribly into cars, from what I can tell). Nothing says you can&#039;t get yourself a decent second-ahdn supercar for £50k, though, I encourage all the City and professional ladies to trade in their wheels for one. If nothing else, they&#039;re going cheap at the moment. (Poor millionares, having to sell their supercars to make the mortgage payments on their mansions...)

Of course, my budget being precisely 50p rather than £50k, I will have to settle for a postcard of one...]]></description>

It was a real problem with Beamers for a while, wasn&#039;t it? Driven by CBW (city boy wankers) and therefore undriveable by anyone else. Now that the CBWs have all moved to Audis (srsly, I was in the city the other day and there were three identical black Audis, all jumping a red light), the Beamer is starting to become a little more acceptable. 

I agree with you that partly it&#039;s an economic status issue: city boy wankers are almost exclusively men, so the car seems aggressive and piss-in-your-face even if it isn&#039;t. There is also something aggressively affluent about the supercar: I am so rich, I can afford to advertise my wealth with this level of aggressiveness, because you are so insignificant that your hatred of me doesn&#039;t even register. See my automatic spoiler erect itself with a flick of my finger! If that&#039;s not a phallic metaphor, I don&#039;t know what is.

Did anyone else clutch their heads with despair over &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/news/8344468/Pagani-Zonda-F-supercar-crashes.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;? Not only did this guy total a Zonda F Clubsport Roadstar, but he&#039;s not bothered, because he was planning on getting himself a Huayra anyway. Mate, you didn&#039;t have to total it, I would have taken it off your hands!!]]></description>

Depends on the car! The new Alfa (4C) has me salivating. It takes all the pretty of the 8C, wraps it up in pretend-practicality, and delivers it for under £40k.

I may decide to forgo such luxuries as rent and food, and just live off its prettiness. And if only the production run wasn&#039;t so bloody limited...]]></description>

Yay, comments! The hivemind likes your comments. 

I think there&#039;s a whole stereotype about who drives these cars which is really hard to separate from the car! So your reaction to seeing one in the street is usually a mix of &quot;coool&quot; and &quot;... wanker, though. Still a wanker.&quot; The stereotype is usually &quot;wannabe machismo chauvinist dude&quot;, especially if the car is being all loud and bass-laden, and the fact remains that I almost never see women driving them. Is this because they&#039;re status symbols, and not as many women actually *are* &quot;city banker&quot; level salaried? And if they were, would they buy them?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The hivemind has entreated me to comment, and so I will, even though I don&#039;t have anything *very* insightful to say. 

I think giant batmobiles are basically awesome. But I don&#039;t think I can explain why. Perhaps it&#039;s a conditioning thing, because I did so enjoy Adam West in his actual Batmobile as a young child. It is sad that they&#039;re almost invariably driven by arseholes. Maybe the solution to this is to stage a stealth takeover by encouraging lots of awesome feminists to buy them? Except probably they could use their money on more important things. I want a Lotus Elise, which is far too cheap to be a supercar, but does look a little bit like a batmobile, and is marginally within the realms of conceivably-financially-feasible-in-fifty-years&#039;-time (when, presumably, petrol will be so expensive cannibal hordes will be fighting over it in the streets, so there&#039;ll be no point having a Lotus Elise...). 

Go Batmobile. (Adam West-era Batgirl drove a motorbike. She was much *more* cool than Adam West.)]]></description>
