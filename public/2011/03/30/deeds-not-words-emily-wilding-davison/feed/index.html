					<description><![CDATA[[...] Rhian&#8217;s post, for Bad Reputation, looks more broadly at the cultural significance of the suffragettes and their commemoration in various media (including the fabulous &#8220;Sister Suffragette&#8221; from Mary Poppins).

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/03/30/deeds-not-words-emily-wilding-davison/#comment-1121&quot;&gt;Russell&lt;/a&gt;.

Rob&#039;s series is about people who&#039;re a little less well known (on the whole) than Davison, who is at least mentioned in several GCSE syllabus textbooks. I did my A Level history coursework on the women&#039;s suffrage movement and she was definitely part o&#039;that! 

I think if there are unsung heroes to be found among the suffrage campaigners they&#039;re probably working class women who were treated on the whole far worse in prison (as Lady Constance Lytton discovered when she was arrested in disguise) and women of colour. I&#039;ve been trying to find out more about women of colour and the suffrage movement lately - so far the resources I&#039;ve turned up online have been about the US movement, but I shall share these links: 

* article on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theroot.com/views/how-racism-tainted-womens-fight-vote&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Ida B Wells, lynchings in the US, and the Temperance movement&lt;/a&gt;

* this &lt;a href=&quot;http://shehasmyeyes.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/black-suffragettes.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;photograph of two women on a stall&lt;/a&gt;]]></description>
