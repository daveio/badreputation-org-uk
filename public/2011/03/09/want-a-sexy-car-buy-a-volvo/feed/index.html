					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/03/09/want-a-sexy-car-buy-a-volvo/#comment-943&quot;&gt;Miranda&lt;/a&gt;.

Continuing the off-topic, with apologies... 

I&#039;d really like to know how well this campaign worked for Volvo, though I assume that&#039;s the sort of stuff we mortals will never get to see. At the time I thought it was a hilariously misconceived marketing strategy, since surely nobody is *ever* going to think a Volvo is a sexy and exciting car, and teenage girls don&#039;t buy all that many cars (even in America?). But now I wonder if it might in fact have been brilliant, since several women in their 40sish also watch Twilight (I believe?), and they might now be inclined to buy a slightly-sexier Volvo for their family transportation needs, instead of a different boring car. 

Disclaimer: I have many varied, complex and strongly-held opinions on the Twilight saga, but of course I&#039;ve never watched any of the films nor read any of the books.]]></description>

An off-topic froth-comment, perhaps, but: 

Oh God, the Cullenmobile. So much wrong is centred round that car! The whole &quot;get in the car I CAN MAKE YOUUU&quot; sequence! The whole &quot;I&#039;M HERE TO RESCUE YOU I AM A TELEPATH&quot; scene! The shitty driving! Ahhhh. 

Reclaim the Volvo, say I, from that association! 

Though I did like that in Twilight, Bella has this massive rusty truck. I just wish she actually drove it around more. Like, AWAY from all the other characters, onto the Freeway, into a better narrative.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The title of this post just makes me think of Edward Cullen&#039;s Vampire Volvo of Great Justice. Sponsorship deals you just can&#039;t believe. Remember the TV ads? (Interesting from a selling-Volvos-to-girls angle?)

Lyndon sounds like an idiot.]]></description>
