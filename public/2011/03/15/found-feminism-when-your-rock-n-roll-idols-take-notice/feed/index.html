					<description><![CDATA[Mention of Riot Grrrl puts into my head something I&#039;ve been thinking about recently -- the way women&#039;s punk bands in this country (The Slits, The Raincoats) are so very different from the American Riot Grrrl bands.

Also, I wonder at so many Riot Grrrl bands having names beginning with B.  Bikini Kill, Bratmobile and Babes in Toyland come immediately to mind.  Are the B names a coincidence?]]></description>
