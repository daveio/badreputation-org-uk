					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/03/24/but-what-about-teh-menz/#comment-1063&quot;&gt;...&lt;/a&gt;.

With respect, I don&#039;t think I trivialised anything. The majority of reactions on the day were that women don&#039;t deserve a &#039;women&#039;s day&#039; because feminism has made everything equal. 

There are vast areas where men are worse off (especially in how strictly they have to appear masculine at all times) and I&#039;ve mentioned that in many of my other posts on here, but the point of this one was to push back against the tide of dismissive or abusive reaction to the Day. I listed some of the issues women face which the male commenters apparently don&#039;t know or care about: none of those are trivial, and none of them are point-scoring for one gender or another.

I don&#039;t seek to portray women as victims in order to win an Olympics, the Equality and Human Rights Commission and other sources I quoted simply relay facts and experiences on the ground. It&#039;s real, not part of any oppression game.

Sorry if you think this post is agenda-driven or one-sided. I focused on women&#039;s experiences because it was IWD, and because the entire internet resounded to talking about men. This was a reply, not an overview of the hardships sexism brings to the whole of society.]]></description>

Yes - it does good work in many countries where it is observed. Unfortunately not many people have heard of it and not many men I know are publicising it as you are here. 

In fairness to Steve, he actually mentioned it in the post: &lt;em&gt;&quot;don’t men get a day, EH?” ... (They do get a day – November 19th – but that’s not my point here.) I’m writing this post so that next year I can just link it every time someone tells me feminism “isn’t needed” or is unfair to men in some way.&lt;/em&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really just wanted to comment on the otter picture...It&#039;s adorable... But I did read everything and I really feel that it &#039;s an important topic that should be addressed more often. As a woman I used to ask this question &quot;What about the men?&quot; because I thought it was fair in terms of equality but you&#039;re right! There is work to be done!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good stuff Stephen!
I know there are more definitions of feminism than there are feminists, but my favourite definition to use in any conversation (especially with the kind of person who asks &quot;what about the men, eh?&quot;) is: 
A feminist is a person who looks at the world, sees that men and women are not treated/viewed equally, don&#039;t have the same chances, are being limited because of their gender, and wishes it was different.
This definition includes men, seems to leave space for most kinds of feminism and sounds incredibly un-threatening :)]]></description>
