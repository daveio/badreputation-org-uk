					<description><![CDATA[&quot;...I wonder if the battle may be coming to us&quot;

Another challenge is abortion is an issue that cuts across standard right-left divisions as opposed to most other areas faced with cuts. 

Still, you can consider me a recruit and enthusiastic flag waver! (So long as it&#039;s a Red one!)]]></description>
