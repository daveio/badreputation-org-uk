					<description><![CDATA[Wow. I was barely able to put &quot;Hunger Games&quot; down for a second after the first few pages got me completely hooked. Normally it takes a week to read a book, but now I read this in 24 hours. Suzanne Collins here has an immediacy to it that, when combined with the very dramatic life-or-death plot, is incredibly compelling. It&#039;s entertaining, and incredibly disturbing all at once. They say great art leaves you changed after you experience it... and this book definitely did that. Suzanne Collins has, with one amazing work, propelled herself onto my top shelf. 

Have a nice day,
Molly

					<description><![CDATA[The trilogy went in a conpletely dog direction than I thought and while I lived the first book, the sequels were just not as good or as satisfying. The amount of action that happens offpage in the second only to be dumped on you in two pages of exposition right at the end was pretty unforgivable as was what I dent to be stunted character development and disconnectness of the characters in the third. 

Could spend all day talking about them though but don&#039;t want to spoil anyone!]]></description>
