					<description><![CDATA[Yay. I remember when these guys were doing their shoddy research (their opening gambit being &quot;We&#039;re deeply interested in broad-based behavioral data that involves romantic or erotic cognition and evinces a clear distinction between men and women.&quot;) and am pleased the shoddiness hasn&#039;t been forgotten. Although... they did get their book published. 

Miranda sadly makes a good point in that lack-of-tagging for feminist books presumably is more of an indication that detractors don&#039;t much need to care, than that... books about feminism are generally adored. But I think this is a nice example of a female-dominated section of internet culture organising to invade the mainstream with sensibleness. 

I may write my PhD in crayon.

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/03/22/found-feminism-amazon-users-and-feminist-tags/#comment-1052&quot;&gt;Stephen B&lt;/a&gt;.

My personal faves are &quot;who needs peer review&quot; (182), &quot;phds written in crayon&quot; (218), and &quot;unforgivable tripe&quot;. 

To see whether feminist books are the subjects of any antifeminist tagging, I took a look at Kat Banyard&#039;s &quot;The Equality Illusion&quot; - she&#039;s clear so far, and only has &quot;feminism&quot; and things like that. 

Then I tried Natasha Walter&#039;s &quot;Living Dolls&quot;. That one has some critical tags in very small numbers, but few are antifeminist. One is &quot;hell hath no fury like a woman scorned&quot; (1 user) but also there are tags like &quot;feminist silence over islam&quot; which could be interpreted in a couple of ways, one of which isn&#039;t antifeminist per se (and another of which is possibly anti-islamic). 

Then I tried The Beauty Myth and got, again, mainly factual or uncritical tags. Apart from &quot;chick science&quot; (1 user) and &quot;fantasy&quot; (1 user) which could be a criticism or a descriptor of the issues it&#039;s tackling! 

I think the sad truth is that books like the one the OP is about are more widely read and plugged than feminist writing, though, hence the higher number of tags. I don&#039;t think feminist books get less bad tags because they are better (well, I think the ones above are, but I also don&#039;t think this magically protects them from shit-slinging; if it did, what a lovely world we&#039;d have!); rather feminism&#039;s detractors often don&#039;t want to actually read about what feminism really might be about at all. 

&quot;phds written in crayon&quot; cheers me greatly, though, when all is said and done! :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love the Amazon tags. They&#039;re so democratic. The top 5 for Tony Blair&#039;s memoir are:

self-serving(156)
abuse of power(143)
illegal war(113)
evil(112)
worst prime minister ever(100)

And that&#039;s after Amazon took &quot;War Criminal&quot; down from the 1st spot...

&quot;Best PM ever&quot; has 17 votes, just for balance. It&#039;ll be skewed in favour of the part of the population who have access to the net and Amazon, but in general I think it&#039;s a wonderful tool for showing real public opinion. Of the psuedo-science book, &quot;My cat does better science&quot; was my fave :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My favourite bit of obvious bullshit is this:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Men and women have hardwired sexual cues analogous to our hardwired tastes-there are sexual versions of sweet, sour, salty, savory, and bitter. But men and women are wired with different sets of cues. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

mostly because a) savory is not a taste category and b) that&#039;s all they are, arbitrary categories of the spectrum of taste, and not &quot;hard wired&quot; at all. (They&#039;d have been better off using the three colours, at least they are perceived descretely)]]></description>
