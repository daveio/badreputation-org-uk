Yup, I was going to include that in the post but ran out of space. She did let the idea down slightly, from what I&#039;ve read, by saying that women should be trained as astronauts but shouldn&#039;t be part of the space race. Apparently she felt beating Russia was the priority and that the time taken to integrate female astronauts would give the Soviets the lead. But still, it&#039;s pretty awesome. There&#039;s more on the whole Mercury 13 in Martha Ackmann&#039;s book, here http://www.amazon.com/Mercury-13-Story-Thirteen-Flight/dp/0375758933]]></description>
