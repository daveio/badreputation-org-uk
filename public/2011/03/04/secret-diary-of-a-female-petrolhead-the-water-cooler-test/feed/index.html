					<description><![CDATA[Yeesh, anyone who can drive in Nairobi is braver than I am! I spent part of my childhood there, and the general road rule was &quot;yield to the bigger car&quot; (terrifying when my dad, accustomed to driving the big car, would drive our small car with the same level of aggression). And there was a HUGE drunk-driving culture, so a disturbingly high number of people we knew were injured or killed in horrible accidents.

Driving in the UK is a stroll in the park by comparison.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I used to get the same crap when I went to Grand Prixs or watched them. Invariably a guy would ask me which one I fancied. I would always blankly look at them and then say &#039;Oh, fancy for the win? I think Alonso&#039;s looking pretty strong after his showing in Italy, but really, it&#039;s Button&#039;s year.&#039; Then smile sweetly and excuse myself to get more booze. Insufferable idiots. Girls can like cars, and understand cars, and enjoy cars. I used to speed up and down the A21 in a car so old it oscillated above 60. Happy, happy days. I miss driving.]]></description>
