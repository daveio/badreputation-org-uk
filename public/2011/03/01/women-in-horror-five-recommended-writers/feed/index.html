					<description><![CDATA[Thank you so much for this list! I&#039;m planning to make 2016 my year of only reading women, and I realized how few female Horror writers I knew. Now I have a brand new reading list that I can&#039;t wait to start :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Excellent list - found this after realizing that SO MANY lists of &quot;best horror writers&quot; don&#039;t include (IMO) nearly enough women. Case in point:

http://www.ranker.com/list/best-horror-novelists/book-keeper

See? Very very disappointing. I&#039;m always looking for new horror writers, and I&#039;m excited about these. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh, and one of the scariest books I have ever read was written by Anne River Siddons and called The House Next Door. She normally wrote genteel Southern USA family saga type books so this short novel is a bolt out of the blue and a perfect haunted house story. She instills the house with an intense sense of evil and plotting and it&#039;s exceedingly good if you like the more supernatural side of horror.]]></description>
