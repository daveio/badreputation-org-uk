					<description><![CDATA[Channel 4 is running a series I&#039;m not sure I could bear to watch called &quot;Big Fat Gypsy Weddings&quot;.  I quote from this week&#039;s Radio Times:

Liverpool dressmaker Thelma Madine is the travellers&#039; designer of choice.  &quot;From the minute these girls can walk and talk all they&#039;re thinking about is getting married and getting the dress of their dreams,&quot; she says.  &quot;And they all want their dresses to be the biggest.&quot;]]></description>

Yeah, like that T-shirt I have (mercifully) never actually seen anyone wear, but which has a certain ubiquity in market stalls: http://www.teesforall.com/images/Humor_Wedding_Game_Over_Black_Shirt.jpg

I think it must go back to the idea that women want commitment and men want sex, hence no groom&#039;s big day (he&#039;s already had sex, and doesn&#039;t want commitment). With the silent woman, I think a lot of the &#039;blushing bride&#039; stereotype is ultimately originally the idea of feminine delicacy about the wedding night: in Sir Charles Grandison, Harriet Byron (engaged) cannot even bring herself to name the wedding day, for fear of seeming too forward.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m struck by the degree to which weddings focus upon (are for) the bride.  I&#039;ve heard them called &quot;bride&#039;s big day&quot;, but never heard even a humorous reference to the &quot;groom&#039;s big day&quot;.  A lot of money is usually lavished directly on the bride, who gets to wear the dress (while the groom&#039;s wedding clothes are usually downright dull).  BBC3&#039;s series &quot;Don&#039;t Tell the Bride&quot; seems based on the idea that weddings are for the brides.  I feel that this level of focus on the woman should please the feminist in me, but it doesn&#039;t.  I recall my own wedding (conducted, I&#039;m pleased to add, in a registry office).  At the reception, a significant number of people were clearly shocked that the bride insisted on making a speech.  Many wedding dresses resemble meringues, and meringues are silent (at least until someone crunches on them).]]></description>

Ooh, silent readers coming out of the shadows! Thanks for your comment – I&#039;m sure direct.gov.uk  was a particularly thrilling link. I was rather hoping to spread the word about The Marriage of Maria Braun though – a very strange film all round. 

Incidentally, re: P&#038;P, one of the things I&#039;ve always found really interesting about Austen&#039;s perception of the marriage market is how she seems to consider the men as much a part of the great bartering scheme as the women – what are Wickham and Willoughby doing, after all, other than trying to get the best financial reward off their looks and charm?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This comes to mind, I think its a brilliantly subtle
exploration of what Churches - and by extension marriage (sorry,
it&#039;s not quite directly relevant) - could still mean, which avoids
quite endorsing either side of the argument:

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve enjoyed all of the Alphabet posts so far, but I think
this was the best one yet and I&#039;ve really enjoyed reading through
all the links. This might be because I just finished re-reading
Pride &amp; Prejudice and am seeing everything through its
lens. Thank you, Hodge!]]></description>

I think a lot of what we now think of as the &#039;traditional wedding&#039; may be American in origin (the US is, after all, the country that spends the most on weddings): I read an article somewhere (might have been the guardian) positing the theory that modern day weddings are getting ever-more elaborate because the institution itself is no longer the terrifying unknown it was before people started &#039;fornicating&#039; as a matter of course and living together pre-marriage. Therefore, couples need something to panic about in its place.

The laziness of the CoE is absolutely right – so many people seem to get married in church to keep some aged relation happy. I suppose in those kind of cases, you&#039;re using the weight of your family&#039;s opinion as the real &#039;witness&#039; to your vows. A sort of God by proxy...]]></description>
