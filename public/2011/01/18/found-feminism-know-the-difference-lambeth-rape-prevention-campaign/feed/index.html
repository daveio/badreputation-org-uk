And if they&#039;d like to back that up by making sure the police in the borough have the same attitudes and do their jobs properly and are punished if they don&#039;t, then I will finally be able to tell everyone Brixton really is the best place in London to live...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Tweeted about this - it&#039;s great to see a campaign like this Doing It Right, as opposed to TfL&#039;s victim-blame-athon &quot;stop. please. stop. please. stop taking unlicensed minicabs&quot; one, which actually made me feel ill.

And I&#039;ve seen Japanese girls making and sharing a poop omelette, nausea-free.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/01/18/found-feminism-know-the-difference-lambeth-rape-prevention-campaign/#comment-590&quot;&gt;Zoe&lt;/a&gt;.

Yep, thanks to you too!  I think it may well have been you pointing it out in those comments that led to Brave Sir Robin, who happened to be in Clapham that week, taking some shots and offering to submit a pic as a Found Feminism. 

Credit all round :)]]></description>
