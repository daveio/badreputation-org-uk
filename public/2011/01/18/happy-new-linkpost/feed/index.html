Hey there! 

Thanks for commenting, we&#039;re glad you like - stick around and let us know if there&#039;s anything you reckon we should be covering or linking to!

I just love the Game Over remix. It has this fantastic, cheeky energy buzz all over it, and a real sense of pride.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello! I was directed to this site through Twitter. Just wanted to let you know I love the links and your articles are great. Thanks for highlighting the Female Takeover of Game Over video, I would never have listened to it otherwise as not my regular sort of music and it is bloody good. Not surprised you&#039;re dancing madly. Elly]]></description>
