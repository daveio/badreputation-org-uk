I can think of many female characters from GoThrones who are *superbly* written, in control of their own destinies and really fearsome (you kinda have to be). I just couldn&#039;t remember one talking to another very often, mostly because they&#039;re from opposing families and would rather be sticking knives in instead :) But yes, since writing the above comment several examples have sprung to mind, all of which only make me MORE EXCITED about the mini-series!]]></description>

The females in the books definitely pass Bechdel.  Repeatedly.  If passing Bechdel were a crime, George RR Martin would be a lifer.  It&#039;s fair to say that every single female character in those books is as well-crafted as the men, often better.  Yes, the world is sexist to the extreme - medieval times were, apparently.  The women survive in it admirably, with even the most annoying (Sansa, Daenerys) eventually becoming wily and powerful.

I can think of at least one example from Bechdel but I bet there are other, better ones - if I only I had my copies here with me.  It&#039;s Cersi and her female sexual partner from Myr, whose name I forget, but they chat about all kinds of things which aren&#039;t about *a* man (they may be about large armies of men, occasionally - does that still count?).]]></description>

Have you seen Psychoville?  That contains short people that, although played for dark comedy, are fleshed out characters and not just comic relief.  It&#039;s also great - by some of the people who did The League of Gentlemen, and similarly &quot;scary-funny&quot;.]]></description>

It&#039;s not made yet, but the books were... actually, I don&#039;t know about Bechdel. Most of the women who survive any length of time in the incredibly lethal world of politics and power-grabbing are either alone or outdoing the men in every department. There are some fantastic (and fantastically evil) female characters, but I don&#039;t know how it&#039;ll translate to the mini-series.

The environment is one of medieval sexism and survival or the evil-est, but that&#039;s what makes the role for Peter Dinklage so interesting. He gets constant abuse and dismissal because of his height, but is the smartest person in the room...

We probably have some huge Game of Throne fans on here: anyone got opinions on the female roles in the books?]]></description>

Yes, I do agree Carnivale was very good. Point taken on that one. 

@Steve What&#039;s Game of Thrones like for Bechdel/women?]]></description>

Michael J Anderson has had some good non-circus roles. And whilst it was pretty much a circus, his role in Carnviale was amazing, and not a standard Midget Strongman/Freakshow Member.]]></description>
