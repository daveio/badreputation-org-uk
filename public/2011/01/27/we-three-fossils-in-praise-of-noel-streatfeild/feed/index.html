Yeah. That second White Boots one is, I think, based on the original illustrations (certainly the ones in my copy, anyway). I wish I knew more about the illustration history, actually. But yeah, I&#039;m just gonna come out with it: that first one is horrible. 

Never quite know what to think about the Jane Austen chick lit thing: I have a visceral sort of UGH reaction, but then I tell myself not to be such a horrible snob – anything that gets people reading classics is surely a good thing? But then, don&#039;t they really want something very different?

It&#039;s a little bit like when you look at how some arthouse films are packaged as sort of soft porn (http://amzn.to/gBWdVU) – you can&#039;t help but think that the person who buys it knowing all about it is going to be put off by the packaging, and the person who buys it thinking it&#039;s soft porn is going to be very disappointed. But then, by that point, you&#039;ve already got their money, and I guess the soft-porn market is bigger than the arthouse market.... I think it&#039;s the same sort of lack of faith in people&#039;s judgement to package White Boots as chick-lit: there&#039;s plenty of actual chick-lit out there, and the fact that they&#039;ve been reissuing Streatfeild does seem to suggest there&#039;s a market for her too.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/01/27/we-three-fossils-in-praise-of-noel-streatfeild/#comment-720&quot;&gt;Hodge&lt;/a&gt;.

I remember coming across another Streatfeild paperback at school - White Boots, I think - that was packaged as sort of late 80s/early 90s teen chicklit. So little-me actually got a third into the book before I began to realise that it was set a bit earlier in time than 1990. Which was weird. 

Some cover art examples: 

&lt;a href=&quot;http://vintagereads.blogspot.com/2009/05/white-boots.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;White Boots goes glam&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://medinger.wordpress.com/2008/01/03/noel-streatfeild/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;A much older Puffin edition&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.librarything.com/work/60370&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Slightly Marian Keyes-font-tastic&lt;/a&gt;

I don&#039;t exactly dislike any of them, but it&#039;s an interesting issue, how books are packaged and repackaged! The whole Jane Austen chick-lit covers reprint thing, and Wuthering Heights reprinted as &quot;Bella and Edward&#039;s favourite book!&quot;... there&#039;s probably a whole other blogpost in there somewhere...]]></description>

Yeah, it&#039;s quite annoying what publishers have done to her: the puffin classics one I had (above) isn&#039;t too bad but I only found out quite a long time after I first read it that it has different illustrations from the original edition. 

The pink treatment is a real shame actually as most of the books feature at least one character who thinks stage school is stupid and would be a really good figure to identify with if you&#039;re a &#039;plain&#039; child surrounded by...less plain, girly children. It&#039;s also just really at odds with the actual content – so many of the books are full of parents dying, war, not being able to afford new clothes, etc. yet they&#039;re being marketed as sort of Angelina Ballerina style books for middle class kids whose parents drive them to ballet on a saturday morning! I know they&#039;re called &#039;Ballet Shoes&#039; and &#039;Dancing Shoes&#039; and so on, but isn&#039;t the whole point of shoes that they don&#039;t always fit?

Incidentally, some time after I&#039;d collected most of what I was going to collect, Jane Nissen Books did a whole bunch of them with sort of graphic covers (http://amzn.to/fgA5Ch). And this one at least isn&#039;t pink, and features the original illustrations: http://amzn.to/dPbZMc]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You know, ironically, I avoided Ballet Shoes for months as a kid, even when teachers pushed it at me, because the cover was so girly I wasn&#039;t sure it was for me. Then I finally read it and loved it. I like that it appeals to so-called &quot;girly girls&quot; and Petrova-types both.
