I recently visited Cadgwith, near The Lizard, and whilst chatting with an elderly gentleman outside his cottage he told me about Lady Mary Killigrew and said that she had lived in the cottage he now owns. It was also previously owned by the pianist Harriet Cohen.]]></description>

Would you happen to know where Lady K is buried? The book I used has pictures of a brass tomb - very lovely- but no location details!]]></description>

Wow, that&#039;s awesome! I really do wish there were some half-decent, widely available books on her and some of the other women I want to look at in this series (continuation of which is much overdue)...]]></description>

I&#039;m actually related to Lady Killigrew. My husband&#039;s family still lives around Falmouth. We have been in the Arwenack house multiple times, legends say that there is still stolen items buried under the house :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for this!
I&#039;m actually doing an English Heritage Pirate gig at Pendennis Castle in a couple of weeks and am stocking up on my research to tell tales of female pirates - I think telling them of the piratical history of Pendennis itself should prove popular!]]></description>

Stealing the whole boat seems to make more sense to me that merely looting the cargo.  Just going for the cargo, Lady K would only have had till morning before the Spaniards woke up to her skulduggery.  (Should that be skull-and-crossbones-duggery?)  Towing the whole boat to another harbour, it could be emptied at Lady K&#039;s leisure.]]></description>
