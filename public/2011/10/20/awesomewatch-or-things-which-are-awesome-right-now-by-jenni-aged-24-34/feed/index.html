Morrigan is super-annoying in a lot of ways, although if you bother to develop the relationship with her she has a few good lines.  Also it&#039;s hilarious to put her into one of the church outfits :v

I find the fighting in DA2 way less fun, and the story way less interesting.  I should put in some more time with it though, tbh.]]></description>

True... but I like the conversations better two-way somehow - more cinematic? The approximations/vague thing I do see, though. 

Oh, and I like Merrill rather a lot (more than Morrigan from 1 who has a thoroughly annoying costume going on - fabulous for Slimelight, terrible for questing outdoors, surely?!), so she&#039;s my vote in favour of DA2, too.]]></description>

Only you don&#039;t have a voice, and you get to know what you&#039;re *actually* going to say before you say it, instead of something vaguely related to what you picked :P]]></description>
