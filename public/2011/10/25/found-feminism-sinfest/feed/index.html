					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/10/25/found-feminism-sinfest/#comment-33675&quot;&gt;Some Guy&lt;/a&gt;.

I can only guess that Ishida is having &#039;recent convert&#039; syndrome: consumed with guilt over his former bad behavior, he&#039;s gone way into overcompensation territory, embracing the most radical fringes of feminism that can still be called &#039;feminist&#039; and presenting them as automatically right and true--to the degree that anyone who disagrees with the overbearing zealot Xanthe is easily branded Evil and handily defeated.

Extremism used to be mocked in Sinfest (example: Seymour the sanctimonious religious nut); now, in one very specific area, it&#039;s applauded. This is a humor-killer.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Could you do a new review of the comic, now that the comic has done nothing but praise Xanthe, AKA Trike Girl.

It is starting to turn against feminism, but giving it a bad name. Those who don&#039;t already subscribe to omnipresent and all-knowing, &quot;encompasses 99% of men&quot; conspiracy Patriarchy idea are going to be put off by it. They feel like they are being blamed for simply being the wrong gender.

Comic makes no difference between &quot;rapist&quot;, &quot;planning to rape&quot; and &quot;trying to talk with woman&quot;. In comics current form, man merely talking to a woman is not done because he wants to talk with woman or even interact, but because man wants to have sex with woman. No exceptions.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Not to be that one guy, but I&#039;m just going to give a fair warning... avoid the sinfest forums. They are full of very angry and very young &quot;feminists&quot;. So if you&#039;re looking for intelligent discussion about the comic go to the sinfest Subreddit on Reddit instead.]]></description>
