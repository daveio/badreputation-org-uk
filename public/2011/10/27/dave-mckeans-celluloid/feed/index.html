					<description><![CDATA[I felt the same about Alan Moore&#039;s LOST GIRLS. I loved that he&#039;d done it, I respected the attempt to mix those subjects with a plan to make genuinely adult erotica, but... it wasn&#039;t sexy. Or very naughty. Maybe I&#039;m way off the norm, but it didn&#039;t do it for me.

And I don&#039;t know why I&#039;m doubly disappointed when comics fail to deliver sexiness. Enough people find Milo Minara&#039;s work stimulating, it must be possible to do.

Anyone out there found an artbook or comic which succeeds at being hot? Or at including mental aspects as well as depicting physical?]]></description>
