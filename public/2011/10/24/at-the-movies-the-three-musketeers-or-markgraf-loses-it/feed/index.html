					<description><![CDATA[New rule. ALL film reviewers, in the world, ever, should include comics like Markgraf&#039;s comics. 
*tries to pull the face in fig c.* 
*fails*

Milady fascinates me. She was a pretty revolutionary type of character when the book was written, I mean, a woman spy, staying ahead of the heroes for most of then plot and, a thief, a killer, sympatheitic in that she was wronged by Athos, etc., but in so many adaptations, no-one&#039;s sort of done anything new with her since... she has just become a &#039;sexy assassin.&#039;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Is there some sort of rule that says there MUST be a new Three Musketeers film at least once every ten years?

Anyway, this sounds mildly diverting. I may rent it, but your review does not inspire me to spend money on seeing it. Wallpaper women are always upsetting.]]></description>
