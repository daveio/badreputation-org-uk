					<description><![CDATA[Hi! I was just looking around at different articles on the Expo. I will be going this year myself for the first time all 4 days, and got a press pass as well. 
I don&#039;t do written publication as of yet, im just a small youtube partner.

It was interesting to get another female view on this. I often feel the views toward female gamers are highly unbalanced and it will be a challange for me to hold my own while Im there maybe? Who knows. I&#039;m a bit nervous...or that could be the excitement LOL

Thanks for your article! Do you plan on attending this year as well?]]></description>
