					<description><![CDATA[I think there is a problem with festivals and toilets, primarily that they are normally disgusting and unhygienic. Not &quot;basic&quot; but positively unhealthy to spend any time in. It&#039;s part of the reason why I stopped going to festivals - not to be too snobbish, but once I couldn&#039;t get VIP tickets, and access to the better facilities therein, I quickly lost interest. It is also completely sexist for security guards to be suggesting that it&#039;s okay for men to pee up against a wall but if women do it it&#039;s not, even if they have got a friend with a cloth or jacket completely covering them.

This article reminded me of the experience of a friend who found she needed to use a tampon on the last day of a festival, and had to use the toilet facilities which by now were at their muddiest, nastiest, and most disgusting, a deeply uncomfortable experience that dimmed the weekend experience for her. 

I think that as much as the festival experience is about rolling about in mud and not eating for three days, there is a kind of discrimination in that it&#039;s not being considered that there might be ways to make that a better experience for both sexes, rather than focusing on perceived male advantages in this area.]]></description>
