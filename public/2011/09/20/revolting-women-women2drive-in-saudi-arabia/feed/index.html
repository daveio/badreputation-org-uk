					<description><![CDATA[&quot; A woman who has a car gets to choose the place she is occupying. If she wants to leave, she is not dependent on anyone else. &quot;

I can&#039;t agree with this strongly enough! Even here in the UK where public transport is safe and (relatively) reliable, not driving can mean a serious lack of independence. 
In a country where just going outside alone is dangerous, it is yet another way of trapping and controlling women and it is heartening to see even this small move towards change - and great to have it publicised.

(Also you have got me thinking a lot about driving and what it means to me)]]></description>
