Haha, yeah. I think the bit where I really realised that yes, this is meant to be funny, and it&#039;s okay to laugh, and it&#039;s not a horror movie was... maybe when the Polish guys turned up with the bear? Or when Hans pointed to his collection of Factor 50 sunscreens.]]></description>

I can neither confirm nor deny the identity of the cameo, because I don&#039;t know for sure myself.  But that bit made me whoop with joy in the cinema. WORST AUDIENCE MEMBER EVER.]]></description>

Also, if the real-life cameo at the end was really him (not mentioning the name as I don&#039;t want to spoil it), I have even more respect for that man now.]]></description>
