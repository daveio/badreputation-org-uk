					<description><![CDATA[Yay! I too am a crafter, (though i&#039;ve never really made something I&#039;d be happy to give as a gift or sell, lol) and I positively identify it as a feminist hobby/activity/whatever. I share photos, ideas and website links with my friends and readily chat about homemade items and the joy they bring. 
It&#039;s not only a great way to be creative (and doesn&#039;t have to be too expensive if, like me, you re-use old clothes and material) but it also helps open up friends (and family) to wider issues like recycling and re-using and hopefully spending less on shop-bought tat at birthday/christmas time.
There are so many great groups (and individuals) doing things like guerilla knitting that are really inspiring - more groups and more ways to not only network, but also to learn a new skill? You have to love it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wanted to show that crafting is not all 50&#039;s housewife-esque and that it can be subverted (which is what my own work often is). By all means, women can choose what they want, it&#039;s just a personal view.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t really understand your criticism of &quot;women in twee, Cath Kidston-esque clothing, trying to make money off the back of all things ‘vintage’&quot; - if this is a free choice by a woman then in what way is it less valuable than embroidering tea towels to sell at a craft fair?]]></description>
