					<description><![CDATA[Will you include Mary MacArthur in your series at some point? I read the short book about her and the Chainmakers strike of 1910 and was very inspired, as well as surprised I&#039;d never heard of her before.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I came across a wonderful anecdote somewhere about how Dr Benjamin Spock (the real life paediatrician, not the Star Trek character) was persuaded to oppose the Vietnam War when, passing the White House one day, he saw a small group of mothers (around 20) who had lost children in the war protesting against it. He went on to become one of the most outspoken voices against the war.  

I have no idea how true this is, but regardless, it is a great illustration of the true power of protest; no matter how small or insignificant, you only have to persuade the right person at the right time to effect real change.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m writing a journal paper on fan activism which touches upon the role women have historically played in charity/activism so this is a very timely (and useful) post for me. I may come back and say more when it&#039;s less late and I&#039;ve read more.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That bit about Marianne reminds me of something my history teacher said about the movement for Irish independence in the early C20th:&quot;Caitlín Ní Houlihán was a woman, meant to be Ireland; which tells you all you need to know about Pádraig Pearse&#039;s views on women. They could be countries, but not people&quot;. (Which is pretty bitchy, as Pearse deffo wasn&#039;t the only misogynist in the movement, but wev. I&#039;ll always be pro-bitching-about-Pearse.)

Anyway, this looks like being a class series. Looking forward to further instalments. :)]]></description>
