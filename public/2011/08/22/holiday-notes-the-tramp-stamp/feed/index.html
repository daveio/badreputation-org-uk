					<description><![CDATA[I hate the phrase, mainly because it has so far successfully deterred me from getting a tattoo there even though I did at some point quite like one and logically it&#039;s a nice place for it (visible in bikini but not in the workplace, skin doesn&#039;t stretch/change, nice and symmetrical). I am forever haunted by my mother telling me not to do x, y and z because &quot;it&#039;s common&quot; (although to be fair she says that about all tattoos including my existing one). 

Unfortunately the barrage of imagery of really tacky lower back tattoos out there on really tacky people (not you, obviously) that I see probably will keep me put of from considering that area as a tattoo location.

Sometimes other people do kind of ruin certain symbols for the rest of us (I am looking at you Nazis, for ruining the swastika, and you the EDL for making the waving of English flags all questionable).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/08/22/holiday-notes-the-tramp-stamp/#comment-1706&quot;&gt;Miranda&lt;/a&gt;.

I&#039;ve never heard that either. I teach cultural studies, and tattoos often come up in class discussions (especially since I have several that are visible), and I tell students that while  &quot;tramp stamp&quot;, &quot;ass antlers&quot;, &quot;New Jersey license plate&quot;, etc., are offensive labels, the lower back is a perfectly reasonable place for young women to choose for her first (or only) tattoo. 

First, it&#039;s easily concealed by clothing when she needs to conceal it -- whether for professional reasons or judgmental family members. Second, it&#039;s one part of the body that changes very little with age or pregnancy, so a well done bit of ink on the lower back is likely to age well as she ages. 

Third, especially in U.S. college contexts, young women may be getting tattoos in contexts of peer pressure and the above reasons are even more important: if she&#039;s not certain she really wants a tattoo and is just getting one because all of her sorority sisters are getting one, best that it *is* easily concealed AND in a place where she herself doesn&#039;t have to see it every day.]]></description>

I didn&#039;t know that!  That&#039;s really interesting, it&#039;s got me comparing the gender politics of the different contexts and trying to work out the possible differences. 

Were they commonly called &quot;tramp stamps&quot;, as in the actual phrase, though?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Agreed in every possible sense of the word.  

I&#039;m not much into tattoos on a personal level (never found anything worth the pain of having it permanently engraved into my skin).  Regardless, I love looking at others&#039; tattoos and I love hearing the reasons behind them, particularly if it involves a story.

Some tattoos aren&#039;t as interesting as others and many are either aesthetically pleasant eye candy (redundant?) or downright fascinating.  Also, the lower back is a great place for an etching.  I recently read somewhere about literary tattoos.  Those sound double awesome (but still not worth the pain, I&#039;m such a baby about a pain hee~) and many look absolutely wicked (in a good sense).

Interesting article, thanks!]]></description>
