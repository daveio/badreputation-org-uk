					<description><![CDATA[I am going to hunt down this film if it kills me.  But in the meantime I am listening to the entire soundtrack on repeat via youtube.  Already I feel as if I&#039;m in some delicate leafy dreamland.  If I ever find the movie it may well put me into a big old Romanticised Trance to boot.

Also I WANT TO SEE THIS CAT OF WHICH YOU SPEAK!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was very dubious about this one, mostly owing to having loved the Borrowers books as a kid and being generally mistrustful of book-to-film adaptations. But now I really want to see it! :D I do like your reviews, they make me giggle :)]]></description>

I agree with you on the subtitles front, but our local art cinema&#039;s having some renovation done, so we only had the opportunity to see the dub. What I find weird is that are two English dubs - the UK one which I saw, and the Disney one that comes out next year. After Warriors of the Wind (the massacre of Nausicaa) Ghibli&#039;s been very protective of its films and Miyazaki has a very close relationship with John Lasseter so I&#039;m not sure why there are two English dubs. I hope the DVD gets both of them as well as the Japanese track though, that would be awesome.

RE: favourite anime dub, I only actually watch the Ghibli films dubbed. I loved Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke. I find that because Japanese is a relatively monotone language, English voice actors try to emulate that and it just doesn&#039;t work. I think it&#039;s been improving with more recent releases though.]]></description>

Yeah, the fact that the English dub blows actually surprises me - Mark Strong being on the cast is my main thing of course (HHRRGNNNGGHNNGH MARK STR-STRONNNGG CAN I HAVE HIM FOR MY BIRTHDAY GOD PLEASE) but also because Studio Ghibli have, in my experience, had rather good dubs!  The Princess Mononoke dub is lovely!  And I seem to recall the Howl&#039;s Moving Castle one being decent, too.

(An aside: my award for Best Anime Dub Literally Ever will always go to Hellsing.  Always and forever.  It is so appropriate and perfect.)]]></description>
