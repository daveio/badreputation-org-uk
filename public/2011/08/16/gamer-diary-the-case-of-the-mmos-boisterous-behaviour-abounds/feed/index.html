					<description><![CDATA[Have to echo the comments about LOTRO. It actually seems to be one of the most female friendly MMOs. Though obviously there are some problematic aspects (guys are the default, no damned female dwarves cannon be damned.)

People are relatively mature. Though there can be some irritating newb questions. HELLO HOW DO I SELL THINGS IN AH I DON&#039;T KNOW. 

But we were all there :).]]></description>

I was thinking the same thing! When I do see f*g or any of those other lovely slurs it&#039;s really shocking. And I only realized reading this article that it&#039;s so rare in LOTRO. Even in my kin, it&#039;s really friendly and not patronizing. Just chatting. I only play on the non-RP servers too.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve played a LOT of MMOs, and been lucky not to encounter the awfulness you describe here - the racial one is *appalling*, and I like to think players I know would pull each other up on it. I&#039;m disappointed, UK.

Here&#039;s my experience of some others:

As Michelle said in the comment above, LotRO is a very polite MMO. 
City of Heroes has been good as well - those are two most mature playerbases I&#039;ve found.
Guild Wars was fine. 

World of Warcraft was mixed, but that&#039;s because everyone plays it, and it depended on the server - some of them were full of terrible abuse (and interesting to note how the spelling goes downhill in parallel to the willingness to yell insults).

I think the PVP element is what swings it: when you add competitiveness to an idealised version of yourself, and put in the anonymity and distance that the internet provides, people go hyper-aggressive very quickly.

I would really say don&#039;t be put off social gaming by this - there are bad servers out there, but a lot of games are better. But OUCH that space-sim story is depressing. I&#039;ve started calling people out every time I see something like it, and they generally do improve.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s very crappy behaviour on the part of the players. I&#039;ve been tempted to try out EVE for ages, but am now... untempted again. Is it worth pointing someone high-up from the parent company at this post?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Lord of the Rings Online is by far the most pleasant MMO I&#039;ve played, chat-wise; I&#039;ve only played on RP servers (because I find that RP servers tend to cut down a little on the badness in chat in any game, as the people who are likely to ascribe homophobic insults to people tend to ascribe them to people who would play on a RP server).

The general trend seems to be the more PvP-based the online game is (I don&#039;t play FPS games because I&#039;m awful at them but I hear they have similar problems), the more likely it is to have incredibly horrible trash-talk on chat. Games that are based around co-operation instead for the most part will tend to have slightly less horrible chat environments.]]></description>
