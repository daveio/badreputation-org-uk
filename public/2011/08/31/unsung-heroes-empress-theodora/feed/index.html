Yes, I heard about that! So maybe not all that unsung. But then again, I think Byzantium&#039;s a bit unsung as &quot;having heard of it outside of classics lessons which most schools don&#039;t offer&quot; goes. So we were like &quot;ah, let&#039;s do Theodora!&quot; 

Plus I love that Sara Bernhardt shot!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For a more fictional account of those times, Guy Gavriel Kay has written two books called &quot;Sailing to Sarantium&quot; and &quot;Lord of Emperors&quot;. He&#039;s basically taken the story of Justin and Theodora, added in some magic and a lot of other characters, and set it in his fictional universe. As I understand it, the story is mostly historically correct, including the Green and Blue factions, and Alixana (being Theodora&#039;s fictional alter ego) was a very intelligent and impressive person.]]></description>
