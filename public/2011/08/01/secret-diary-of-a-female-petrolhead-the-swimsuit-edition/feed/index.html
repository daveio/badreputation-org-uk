					<description><![CDATA[I read an article a while ago about NASCAR trying to shepherd female drivers because when the first female driver joined the circuit their viewership noticeably jumped.  The women they&#039;d found to invest in were mostly daughters of racers, which seems to be a common theme in male-dominated fields (it&#039;s certainly one I&#039;ve observed in programming).

In general, it seems to be a problem of sponsorship.  Several women who had every opportunity and were outstanding racers have since moved into management because they couldn&#039;t get the cash to drive.  

There are some groups trying to balance the scales slightly (http://newestscholarship2010.blogspot.com/2011/02/new-scholarship-program-for-female-race.html) and such programs, along with a lot of hard work and perseverance from individual women, have paid of in significantly more women on the stock car circuit.  It&#039;s still not 50%, but since ten years ago people were still making &quot;women driver&quot; jokes (aside: which I&#039;ve never understood, since on average women are better drivers in America than men) it is progress.]]></description>
