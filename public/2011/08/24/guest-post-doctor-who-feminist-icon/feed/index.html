He was anti-science in that waaay too many of his plots were of the &quot;WHAT HAS SCIENCE DONE?!?!?!?!?!?!&quot; disaster formula.

Case in point: the utterly vile episode which kicked off Tennant&#039;s disastrous tenure, where the cat nuns (women doing men&#039;s work) did medical research on bodies specially cultured to not be truly alive to suffer, but they were arbitrarily granted souls (signified by the ability to speak english), by RTD because medical research is, by default, evil. The female authority figure also turned out to be evil for no real reason too, as per usual.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Aaaaah all this talk of RTD vs Moffat has reminded me that PRESS GANG existed!

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082xjcph9NY

Okay, I feel old now, but it was *awesome*. And contained, if I remember right, not only extremely feminist-friendly characters, but young people being consistently treated as adults and some properly gripping storylines. This is why I never doubted the writing on the latest series of Who, I have deep ingrained childhood love of Moffat scripts :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post, Lori. If you think Sarah Jane was good, you should check out the Third Doctor&#039;s first companion, Dr Elizabeth Shaw, who saved the world through brains and bloody-mindedness regularly during her one and only season.

FWIW, I don&#039;t think RTD was antiscience. He&#039;s just a dreadful scifi writer who didn&#039;t think Who was a scifi show.]]></description>

I do agree, however... without him, would Who have made it back onto oour screens at all?]]></description>

The Aztecs story has been recommended to me recently by someone else too. I think I need to hunt down a copy of that asap!]]></description>

@Joff:

&quot;New Who suffered early on in feminist terms due to RTD, who sadly turned out to be a muddled, hypocritical, anti-science, chauvenistic, fat hating, genocide supporting one trick pony. &quot;
