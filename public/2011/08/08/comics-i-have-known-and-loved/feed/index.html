					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/08/08/comics-i-have-known-and-loved/#comment-1665&quot;&gt;Sarah Cook&lt;/a&gt;.

At some point I want to do a roundtable discussion and use the transcript as a post (not on Y, though, as I think we might talk about that in a post anyway soon). Having seen us all in the pub, I think it&#039;d be really entertaining reading.

Everything I say will be faithfully transcribed with the caps lock on, as is only right and proper.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh man, Lucifer. 
Lilith, 
Mazikeen, 
Elaine, 
Jill Presto... some GREAT female characters who were stars of their own storylines, even if the series was named after the famous guy.

God: You&#039;ve been unhappy because you&#039;ve desired things that cannot be.
Lucifer: That&#039;s what desire is. The need for what we can&#039;t have. The need for what&#039;s readily available is called greed. 

....And now I need to re-read all of it again, thanks for that.]]></description>
