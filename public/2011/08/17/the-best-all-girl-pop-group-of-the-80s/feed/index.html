					<description><![CDATA[While The Bangles may not have written their biggest hits, they certainly wrote a great number of their album tracks and they did/do play their own instruments so I think it&#039;s a bit mean to imply that they are in the same division as Bananarama.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I occasionally try to convince people of the Secret Punk Past Life of Belinda Carlisle, as she seems to be remembered mostly for her solo career as a kind of proto Katy Perry, with the Go-Gos lost to history. In future I will direct them to this post. Thank you! x]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love the Go-Go&#039;s.  Seeing this post made me check to see whether I could find anything of theirs I don&#039;t have.  And I find that I&#039;m missing one album (Talk Show).  Casting about for a copy, about the cheapest I can find on CD is around £30.  Do I splash out???]]></description>
