					<description><![CDATA[I am so delighted you wrote about Mae Jemison! She, alongside Valentina Tereshkova, is a major personal hero of mine and this post does her justice. You might want to check out her &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/maejemison&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; for further awesomeness, including her occasional online twitter exchanges with Nichelle Nichols herself. Doctor, astronaut, on the bridge and online - love it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Fantastic! Mae Jemison is AWESOME! In fact, right now I cannot think of a rival candidate for the title of Most Awesome Human Ever. And, on a personal note, it makes me happy that she was born just down the Tennessee River from where I lived as a small child :)]]></description>
