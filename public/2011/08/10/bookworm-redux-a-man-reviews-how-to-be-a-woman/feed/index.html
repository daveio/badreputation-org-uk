I know it’s a little self-defeating to be using sex as the message. Lots of men have a problem with being seen as feminists, when there’s so much scope for them to be received positively, and I was half playing it for laughs. It works better in Moran’s book, because she balances it with a strong focus on how sexualising all relations (mostly for advertising reasons) is really not helping any of us.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Identifying as a feminist in actions as well as words (unless you’re a lying weasel who is just doing it to get into their knickers) will by itself put you quite far into the “not a raging asshole” category. That’s hot. I’m just saying.&quot;

I don&#039;t get it. It&#039;s not okay to lie about being a feminist to get into girl&#039;s pants...but it is okay to be a &#039;real&#039; feminist, even if you&#039;re still doing it because &#039;it&#039;s hot&#039; to the ladies? Do men have to be encouraged to do &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt; by implying they might get more pussy? I don&#039;t think so.]]></description>

Yeah, I&#039;m halfway through it and have found it hugely entertaining, but initially when it came out I was reluctant to read it because of the title! Also the Marian Keyes style posters, which say things like &quot;tiny pants and Lady Gaga? This book has being a woman TAPED&quot; - as someone who&#039;s never given a crap about either enough to need a How To at any rate, it looked from the marketing like a real life Bridget Jones memoir - which it isn&#039;t. I think it could&#039;ve been better marketed in some ways. Can&#039;t quite decide at the mo. (Maybe when I&#039;ve finished the book I&#039;ll be clearer...)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If I may be allowed to disagree just for a tiny bit... (I promise I&#039;ll keep my most radical views to myself)

This book may be titled &quot;how to be a woman&quot;, but it&#039;s written by a single woman in the form of a memoir. A more appropriate title would have been &quot;how to be caitlin moran&quot;. There will be plenty of women on this planet who do not feel their lived experiencies can be accurately portrayed by Moran&#039;s life. 

Language is important. Moran may be, on the one hand, refusing to engage with politics. But on the other, she&#039;s titling her book &quot;how to be a woman&quot;. That&#039;s a political statement in itself.]]></description>
