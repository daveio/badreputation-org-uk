					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m another Tank Girl fan, and agree, mostly. I think that the her tendency to be sporting at least one or two sticking plasters where she&#039;s cut herself shaving takes her firmly away from the &quot;perfect sexy comic-book woman&quot; place.

Incidentally, if you can find them, the Alan Moore American Gothic comics are available in a black-and-white version, published a long time back by Titan, when colour printing was expensive. I prefer them that way. The current Titan collections are colour, sadly.]]></description>
