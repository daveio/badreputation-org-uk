<p><strong>Nellie Bly</strong> (born Elizabeth Jane Cochran) was not the sort of person who took nonsense from anybody. A pioneering journalist, she got her first break in writing when she grew angry at the appalling views on women touted by Erasmus Wilson, the most popular columnist of the <em>Pittsburgh Dispatch</em>, and wrote them a letter to complain. The paper, impressed by the spirit of the letter, took her on as a columnist.  This is a fantastic way to get a job, declaring “No, you’re awful. I could do this much better. Let me show you how,” and then backing up that claim.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Nelliebly.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="3418" data-permalink="/2011/02/18/unsung-heroes-nellie-bly/nelliebly/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Nelliebly.jpg?fit=300%2C251&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="300,251" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Nelliebly" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Nelliebly.jpg?fit=300%2C251&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Nelliebly.jpg?fit=300%2C251&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-3418" title="Nelliebly" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Nelliebly.jpg?resize=300%2C251" alt="Sepia photograph of Nellie Bly: Caucasian young woman with dark hair tied back in a bun with a blunt fringe, in checked=" width="300" height="251" align="left" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Bly’s life before this hadn’t exactly been simple, something which may have helped her develop her intense levels of badass. Born the 13th child out of 15, Bly’s father died when she was six, leaving her mother and siblings with nothing due to will issues. Her stepfather was an abusive drunk, whom Bly described in court as being “generally drunk since he married my mother. When drunk he is very cross, and [he is] cross when sober.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bly’s initial work for the <em>Dispatch</em> showed glimpses of the journalistic style she would go on to develop. She covered the difficulties faced by working class women and girls, the urgent need for reforming the state’s divorce laws, and the lives of local factory workers. So the editors decided after this to put her in the &#8216;women’s interest&#8217; pages and have her cover minor fashion events and flower shows. Bly tried to get back to serious reporting by having herself sent to Mexico to write as the <em>Dispatch</em>’s foreign correspondent, but this only lasted for a few months before she was returned once again to the women’s pages.</p>
<p>Did Bly settle for a career writing lighthearted fluff, or give up journalism, accepting Wilson’s claim that a woman doing more serious work would be “a monstrosity”? Of course she didn’t, because she was awesome. She left a suitably withering note for Wilson and moved to New York in order to find work on a paper that would take her seriously.</p>
<p>Now, getting into journalism is not an easy task. It isn’t easy now and it wasn’t easy in 1887, particularly if you happened to be poor and female. Generally after six months of failing to get a job, one might give up and return home to do something easier. The people covered in this series are not the sort of people who give up and go home when things get hard, however, and after six months of knocking on doors Bly managed an interview at the <em>New York World</em>, owned by <strong>Joseph Pulitzer</strong> (he of the prize). The editor, John Cockerill, &#8211; possibly in an attempt to deter her &#8211; challenged Bly to write a piece on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackwell%27s_Island"><strong>Blackwell’s Island</strong></a>, then home to a notorious New York asylum.</p>
<p>In order to fully appreciate how blazingly fantastic what Bly did next was, it’s important to realise that investigative journalism wasn’t really a thing that existed at that point. People didn’t go undercover to write reports, or press closely-guarded inside sources for facts. It just wasn’t something that happened. This is what made Nellie Bly a pioneering journalist: she went undercover, and feigning insanity for 10 days, managed to have herself sent as a patient to the Women&#8217;s Lunatic Asylum on Blackwell’s Island to see for herself what was going on. This was particularly bold, as she had no guarantee she would be able to secure her release when the piece was done, and indeed had some difficulty regaining her freedom. She came back with a story of cruelty, beatings and poor conditions &#8211; examples of pretty much everything that was wrong with 19th century mental health care. Not only did Bly’s report get her the job at the <em>New York World</em>, it also drew public and political attention to the institution. This brought money and much needed changes, improving the lives of the people treated there. An impressive achievement for someone only just starting their career.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Could I pass a week in the insane ward at Blackwell&#8217;s Island? I said I could and I would. And I did.</p>
<p>– Nellie Bly</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pioneering the field of investigative journalism and spending her career writing important pieces on workers&#8217; rights, the treatment of women, and other socially important issues wasn’t quite enough for Bly, however. She still had a significant quantity of badass in her that she needed to make use of, and there was only one outlet for it that held sufficient coolness: a race around the world. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phileas_Fogg"><strong>Phileas Fogg’s</strong></a> 80 day trip around the world was all well and good, but it was fictional. Bly was going to be the first person to do it for real, and she was going to do it better.</p>

</div>
Carrying only the clothes on her back, a quantity of currency, and some toiletries, Bly set out in a race against <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Bisland">Elizabeth Bisland</a></strong>, a reporter for a rival paper. She travelled through Europe, into North Africa, and on to Asia. In Paris, appropriately enough, she met <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_verne">Jules Verne</a></strong>. Short reports on her progress filtered home through the newly developed electric telegraphs, gripping popular imagination at the time when they were printed in the <em>New York World</em>. On the afternoon of January 25th, 1890, Bly returned to New Jersey. Her journey had taken <em>72 days and 6 hours</em>, beating Bisland by a considerable margin, and shaving over a week off Fogg’s fictional voyage.
<p>So, by the age of 26, Bly had pioneered a new form of journalism, written countless important pieces in support of worker’s rights and women&#8217;s suffrage, and set the record for the fastest solo trip around the world. Doing either of these things is enough to cement someone’s claim to brilliance, let alone both.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is only after one is in trouble that one realizes how little sympathy and kindness there are in the world.</p>

<p><em>I have a confession to make: I&#8217;m not actually a petrolhead. Not even a little bit. I didn&#8217;t play with cars as a little girl, and I didn&#8217;t go to track days with my father. I never learned to drive, and wouldn&#8217;t have been able to tell the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crankshaft">crankshaft</a> from the water pump even if you held a gun to my head.</em></p>
<p><em>At least, that was the case three months ago. I’m not going to go into the many and varied reasons why, sitting on the sofa one November weekend, I decided that I wanted to know more about cars. Suffice to say that maybe I was going a little house-crazy from being stuck indoors with the flu.</em></p>
<p><em>So I decided I was going to rebuild an engine.</em></p>
<p><em>This is a difficult and challenging task if you’ve worked with cars all your life. It is nigh on impossible if you can’t tell your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piston">pistons</a> from your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poppet_valve">poppets</a>. I also decided I was going to learn how to drive. This, too, would be a challenge, as the last time I’d been behind the wheel of a car had been twelve years ago. My father decided that, as I was seventeen and had my newly-minted provisional license in my pocket, the best thing to do for my first hour in the driver’s seat would be to take me out in London rush hour and make me practise three-point turns and parallel parking. After miraculously not killing anyone, I swore that I’d never get behind the wheel again.</em></p>
<p><em>The other major drawback is that my father was an engineer and a mechanic. He had engineering for his work, and mechanics for his hobby. You can imagine what his reaction would be if one of his children finally &#8211; finally! &#8211; showed an interest in anything remotely mechanical. Even if it was the girl.</em></p>
<p><em>Obviously, you can’t just walk off and buy yourself an engine. Well, actually, you can, but there’s not much point. First off, you have to work out where you’re going to keep it. There’s a useful space in the back garden, and I’ve measured for tarp, engine stand, and general manoeuvrability. It will, I am told, be sufficient.</em></p>
<p><em>Then, you have to come to terms with the fact that you’re building an engine, not a car. There’s no space to keep a clapped-out old banger in suburban London, and I’m not about to shell out for a garage for no apparent reason. The downside is that my beautiful rebuilt engine will never be seen in action. The upside is that I am far less likely to explode myself and the neighbours.</em></p>
<p><em>Thirdly, you’re going to need to get some tools and learn about engines. And therein lies the rub. Have you ever tried to find a general mechanics course? Have you? I have. There are two choices:</em></p>
<ol>
<li><em>Full-time year-long course leading to an NVQ or equivalent;</em></li>
<li><em>How to not explode your car when changing the oil.</em></li>
</ol>
<p><em>OK, so they weren’t terribly suitable. How about a textbook? I used to be an academic, I’m good with textbooks. Well –</em></p>
<ol>
<li><em><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/INTERNAL-COMBUSTION-ENGINE-John-Heywood/dp/0071004998/ref=wl_it_dp_o?ie=UTF8&amp;coliid=IT8GDGY18CDRG&amp;colid=H3BWGWZ0MDIK"><strong>Internal Combustion Engine Fundamentals</strong></a> by John B. Heywood – looks interesting, and has been added to the wishlist.</em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Essential-Care-Girls-Danielle-McCormick/dp/0955732913/ref=wl_it_dp_o?ie=UTF8&amp;coliid=I1KE2NLY0FJP3R&amp;colid=H3BWGWZ0MDIK"><strong>Essential Car Care for Girls</strong></a> by Danielle McCormick – well, it’s pink. It must be just for girls. The reviewers helpfully point out that this is a book simple enough for even women to understand. OK, then.</em></li>

<p><em>After wishlisting the first and stabbing my eyes out over the second, I decided that textbooks may be all well and good, but what I really needed was an opportunity to take the damn thing apart myself. (Yes, I was the child that disassembled all my toys to see how they worked.) Unfortunately, in order to do that… Yup, I was back at square one.</em></p>
<p><em>Despondent, I complained about this Catch 22 to a colleague of mine, who had been making similar noises about getting a little fed up of being pushed into a knitting club or daisy-counting-clique. What she really wanted, she said, was to mess about with something a little more robust, like an engine…</em></p>
<p><em>So. We’ve measured the back garden. We’ve ordered appropriate textbooks and acquired a couple of Haynes manuals. We’ve ordered a model engine to get a rough idea of how this all works. I’ve signed up for driving lessons in the vain hope that I can overcome my car phobia.</em></p>
<p><em>And then, once the sun comes out, we’re going to lay down the tarp and set up the engine stand, and buy a crappy clapped-out engine off eBay for 50p and take it apart.</em></p>
<p><em>I’m not going to tell my father a word about all of this. I have a horrible feeling that he will be so delighted that I have finally come around that he will decide to show me how to do it ‘properly’. Where my teachers failed to instil any interest in me at age 12, I am hoping that my own interest at age 29 will bear out and let me stick with it.</em></p>

<p>Seen <strong><a href="http://www.channel4.com/programmes/10-oclock-live/4od">Ten O’Clock Live</a></strong>, then? &#8230;Yeah. Breathlessly billed as Britain’s answer to the <strong>Daily Show</strong>, a return to the satirical standard set by 1962’s groundbreaking <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That_Was_The_Week_That_Was">That Was The Week That Was</a></strong> and the <em>grand guignol</em> glory days of <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spitting_Image">Spitting Image</a></strong>, with hype like that the show was perhaps doomed to fall short of expectations.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/10_OClock_Live_titlescreen.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="3364" data-permalink="/2011/02/16/ten-o-clock-live-three-men-and-a-little-lady/10_oclock_live_titlescreen/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/10_OClock_Live_titlescreen.jpg?fit=250%2C140&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="250,140" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="10_O&#8217;Clock_Live_titlescreen" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/10_OClock_Live_titlescreen.jpg?fit=250%2C140&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/10_OClock_Live_titlescreen.jpg?fit=250%2C140&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3364" title="10_O'Clock_Live_titlescreen" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/10_OClock_Live_titlescreen.jpg?resize=250%2C140" alt="Titlescreen for 10 O'Clock Live: blue background with purple and blue shimmery shapes in the background, white block capitals in stylised lettering reading &quot;10 O'Clock Live&quot;" width="250" height="140" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>I’ve been more or less enjoying <strong>Ten O’Clock Live</strong>’s exuberant attempt to blend righteous indignation and political analysis with gags about Ed Balls’ surname. Britain’s current political nightmares certainly need and deserve something like it. Inevitably, there’s a lot to criticise: the show can be lightweight and facile, and its concern with playing to a broad audience can lead it to simplify complex issues and treat them in a manner often unhelpfully flippant and glib. Tonal inconsistency exists between its sporadically vicious satirical intent and the soft-soaping it tends to give when interviewing political figures. The much-vaunted live format adds little, the graphics and set make <strong>Brass Eye</strong>’s intentionally eye-bleeding credits look soothing, and the pace of the initial episode felt frenetic and rushed, as though the show’s producers didn’t trust the audience to pay attention beyond the length of a YouTube viral – although they’d hardly be unique in that.</p>
<p>My main concern, though, is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauren_Laverne">Lauren Laverne</a>, whose involvement I’d been avidly anticipating. Full disclosure: <a href="https://velvetcoalmine.wordpress.com/2010/03/11/handbags-and-gladrags-the-glittery-genius-of-kenickie/">I was a teenage <strong>Kenickie</strong> fan</a>, and I hoped Laverne, their former singer, would bring some of the arch wit, droll delivery and star-spangled glamour which she used to rock onstage, as well as the stridently socialist principles she used to espouse (in the run-up to the 1997 election, she wrote a politically-conscious column for the <strong>NME</strong>, and Kenickie repaid Geri Halliwell’s pro-Thatcher drivelling by succinctly denouncing the Spice Girls as ‘Tory scum’). In fairness, over ten years on, that sort of expectation was both naïve and nostalgic. While she wasn’t great, her performance didn’t have me rapt in the slack-jawed horror which appeared to be affecting some reviewers, whose critical responses to the show singled out Laverne, its only female presenter, for her allegedly pointless and tokenistic inclusion and relatively toothless comic chops.</p>

<p>A few of these responses betrayed problematic attitudes of their own, seeming unwilling to countenance the idea of a regional-accented blonde with an indie-pop background and glittery eyelids as anything more than eye-candy. The <strong>Telegraph</strong>’s Ed Cumming, in a review entitled <a href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/culture/edcummingliterature/100050836/10-oclock-live-stumbling-awkward-and-what-is-the-point-of-lauren-laverne/:">‘What is the point of Lauren Laverne?’</a>, dismissed her as ‘northern totty’ and declared ‘it’s hard to see what, apart from the sadly obvious, she brings to the table’. <a href="https://www.metro.co.uk/tv/853292-10-oclock-live-was-more-cracking-jokes-than-breaking-news">The <strong>Metro</strong></a> described her as the show’s ‘weak link’ and claimed, less than accurately, that she ‘looked lost and confused when The XX or Mumford and Sons didn’t pop up in the headlines’. <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/tv-entertainment/columnists/kevin-osullivan/2011/01/23/a-load-of-old-clock-115875-22868832/#ixzz1DChfxwsh">Kevin O’Sullivan</a> in the <strong>Mirror</strong> sneered that ‘Poor token female Lauren Laverne … comes across as a bland bombshell recovering from entirely ­successful comedy bypass surgery’.</p>
<p>While I’m sure her looks and residual indie cred didn’t harm her chances, asserting that Laverne was picked for ‘northern totty duty’, able to engage with little beyond the autocue, seems overly harsh. Apart from an occasional turn on <strong>Mock the Week</strong>, Laverne’s background is in presenting and live broadcasting on the <strong>Culture Show</strong> and <strong>6Music</strong>, and her anchorwoman role on <strong>Ten O’Clock Live</strong> is presumably based on her abilities and experience in this arena, rather than that of live comedy. The two require different skillsets and Laverne is an excellent host, introducing and concluding the show, linking pieces, throwing to break and chairing roundtable discussions. That’s what she brings to the table – she’s not a weak link, she’s <em>the</em> link, there to be the viewer’s guide. Unfortunately, her function as this – the show’s secretary, or Mum, or primary-school teacher – means that she’s there less to perform and more to keep the boys in order and to ask them what they think, the opinionless eye of a satirical storm whipped up by her more vocal and dynamic co-presenters.</p>

<p>When Laverne does step out of the secretarial role, she’s badly served by her material. The opening show’s skit in which she played an airhead newscaster may have been an attempt to play on the superficially vacuous persona which several reviewers were expecting of her, but its feeble stabs at humour reinforced the image rather than subverting it. The same was true of the recent piece in which she haplessly ‘volunteered’ backstage, a part which could have been taken by one of the male presenters to make the same point – that making public services reliant on ill-informed and inexperienced amateurs is a blatantly bad idea – without the Ditzy Provincial Blonde aspect to which her material seems wedded. Elsewhere, Laverne’s rants on corporate accountability and the Coalition’s selling-short of liberal democracy, while gobsmackingly commendable (and she clearly means it, man), impress more for rhetorical power than comic panache. In the show’s third episode she invoked the spectres of her past by quoting the Manic Street Preachers during a defence of public libraries; I loved the principles behind this piece, but it was annoyingly punctuated by lazy self-deprecating gags – she’s a girl, so she’s looking up what ‘menstruation’ means! And she’s got access to all these books, but she just wants to read something by Katie Price! – which undermined her authority to make the serious points at the sketch’s heart. Again, perhaps the idea was to knowingly play on or subvert the dumb blonde image, but Laverne is alone in resorting, or having to resort, to jokes at her own expense rather than that of the show’s purported targets. Laverne is also a mother who frequently mentions taking her kids to the local library – this angle could have been used to support her case as well as introducing nuance to her persona, but I guess motherhood would have been unsexily out of step with the show’s desired audience. In a comedy catch-22, while I’d like her to be more than the attractive anchorwoman, when she does so the material she’s given seems to reinforce the recommendation that she stick to presenting.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">All this says less about Laverne’s own intelligence or ability and more about her frustrating under-use by the show’s writers and producers. To place her in this ‘straight-man’ role, <em>and</em> to have her as the only female, seems surprisingly regressive. We’ve come a long way from women in comedy troupes, notably the Pythons’ ‘glamour stooge’ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Cleveland">Carol Cleveland</a>, being little but dollybird foils. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Morris_%28satirist%29">Morris</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armando_Iannucci">Iannucci</a> axis of satire particularly excelled at utilising performers like Rebecca Front, Doon Mackichan, and Gina McKee throughout the 1990s and 2000s.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Since Laverne’s position as the show’s lone female exacerbates any criticism she receives, might some of this critical heat simmer down if <strong>Ten O’Clock Live</strong> featured another woman, in a performing rather than presenting role? There’s no shortage of vocal and opinionated female comics – I can think, before Googling ‘female political comic’, of <a href="http://www.nataliehaynes.com/">Natalie Haynes</a>, <a href="http://www.shazia-mirza.com/">Shazia Mirza</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo_Brand">Jo Brand</a>, and <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2010/aug/26/josie-long-edinburgh-review">Josie Long</a> – whose participation might be as interesting, amusing and incisive as that of Brooker, Mitchell or Carr. But after all, once we start analysing the show’s diversity beyond gender, it becomes painfully apparent that Laverne’s fellow presenters are three middle-aged, middle-class white Englishmen in suits, all but Brooker Cambridge-educated, with the most diverse thing about them being their haircuts’ degree of aerodynamism. My problems with Laverne are symptomatic of greater problems with the show: while sometimes refreshingly radical in perspective, it&#8217;s still small-c conservative in parts.</p>

<p>Now, I know we already have our own Film Cricket here at BadRep, and I should really be off writing an alphabetical list of something, but I feel impelled to speech by the power of <strong>Swan Lake</strong> (and not just because I used to spend hours trying to make my chubby little six-year-old legs form the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIC0nm4nrI8">Cygnet Dance)</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Black Swan</strong>, Darren Aronofsky&#8217;s latest filmic offering, hinges upon the idea of a cunning duality running through Tchaikovsky&#8217;s ballet <strong>Swan Lake</strong> (1877). We know this because within about fifteen minutes of the film&#8217;s opening, the creepy French dance teacher Thomas (Vincent Cassel) has given a rather thinly disguised explanation of what the whole film is about, clumsily telling a room full of professional dancers what the plot of this &#8216;done-to-death&#8217; ballet is.</p>
<p>Except he doesn&#8217;t. The plot of <strong>Swan Lake</strong> is a composite of various Russian folk tales and a German short story called &#8216;The Stolen Veil&#8217;. It features Prince Siegfried who is reluctant to marry, despite the wishes of his queen-mother. But one night he meets the swan-queen Odette and is completely won round: alas, tragedy ensues when Rotbart, the evil magician, sends his daughter Odile (the &#8216;black swan&#8217;) off to impersonate Odette at the Prince&#8217;s birthday party, which she does so well that he mistakes her for his True Love. Yada yada yada. It&#8217;s a fairly clear example of the &#8216;fairy bride&#8217; tradition (where a man meets a magical woman whom he marries and inevitably loses), and typical of Romanticism and other Romantic ballets in its interest in man&#8217;s relationship with the supernatural and the ideal: Odette is fundamentally unattainable, an imagined perfection, not a representation of <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Oxford-Companion-Fairy-Tales/dp/0198601158">sexual love</a>.</p>
<p>But not if you&#8217;re Aronofsky, who can&#8217;t resist a little Psychology 101: the Black Swan (whose appearance on stage in the original ballet amounts to a measly few dances) becomes Odette&#8217;s &#8216;EVIL TWIN&#8217;, a good old fashioned Id to Odette&#8217;s Ego. Just to clarify, that&#8217;s Black Swan = BAD, White Swan = GOOD (repeat ad nauseum). Siegfried, whose own sexual stand-offishness and maternal relationship is a lynchpin in the ballet, is all but gone in the film, where he functions simply as a sort of pole for the prima ballerina to dance around. She, on the other hand, now has all his issues and then some: the White Swan is FRAGILE and VIRGINAL (yet has somehow managed to woo her reluctant prince into marriage in the course of a single night), and, in perverted-Ugly-Ducking style, no one wants to fuck her (boo hoo). Meanwhile, the Black Swan is a bit oh-matron, a Sexy Seductress. Were she living in 21st century Manhattan, Aronofsky decides, she would be taking drugs, listening to her iPod, sexin&#8217; down the clubs, and carrying a black singlet around &#8216;in case she ends up somewhere unexpected&#8217;. Gosh darn it, isn&#8217;t she exactly like this rather pouting ingenue who can&#8217;t dance very well, but has lots of passion?</p>
<p>Thus this Romantic tale – which actually has much to offer <strong>Black Swan</strong>&#8216;s premise through its use of supernatural and metaphorical elements, illusion, ideals and identity – becomes a tired old angel/whore dichotomy, and an indirect sort of homage to the ur-backstage bitches backstabbing drama, <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_About_Eve">All About Eve</a></strong> (1950). I can&#8217;t help feeling here, though, that Aronofsky may have arrived at the party a bit late: as Spanish cinema fans will remember, back in 1999 Pedro Almadovar made a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_About_My_Mother">brilliant film</a> based on just this cinema classic, and also managed to fix the 1950s gender politics in the process, making the whole thing a loving tribute to women&#8217;s endurance, rather than a film about how women always screw each other over.</p>

<p>But even if you read <strong>Black Swan</strong> as a straight portrait of mental disorder rather than a supernatural horror story (a lazy choice to give an audience, and a bit clever-by-numbers, don&#8217;t you think?) the whole thing still hinges around a sexual awakening that portrays lesbianism as a freakish Other, sex itself as A Bit Naughty and the definition of a successful woman as &#8216;a seductive one&#8217;. And from this angle, too, <strong>Black Swan</strong> is derivative of a much finer (and less misogynistic) film, Michael Haneke&#8217;s <strong>La Pianiste</strong> (2001), which, er, features as its main character a self-mutilating, sexually repressed champion piano player who lives with her obsessive privacy-intolerant mother who wants to live through her daughter.</p>
<p>This post has not been attempting a sword-swinging defence of the sacred <strong>Swan Lake</strong> story: as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swan_Lake_(Bourne)">Matthew Bourne has shown</a>, it is a skeleton on which vastly different interpretations can hang beautifully. And, yeah, I get metaphor and that. But what really bothered me was this feeling throughout the film that despite the constantly pummeled &#8216;BLACK SWAN WHITE SWAN&#8217; contrast, manipulation of Tchaikovsky&#8217;s music on a scale not seen since Disney&#8217;s <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjegSDxnVX0&amp;feature=related">Sleeping Beauty</a></strong> (itself <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sleeping_Beauty_(ballet)#Trademark_controversy">based on</a> another Tchaikovsky ballet) and the whole &#8216;ballet theme&#8217; thing, Aronofsky really has no interest in any of those things except as they make him look Clever and link up (in a feminine sort of way) with his Grand Theme of vocations that require you to abuse your body (a la <strong>The Wrestler</strong>). A case in point is Nina&#8217;s much-touted &#8216;minor eating disorder&#8217;, which is presumably introduced as part of the whole &#8216;dancers are thin and they lust after physical perfection&#8217; thing, and something I have a couple of key problems with. These are: firstly, its yawn-inducing predictability, exploiting <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/11/30/alastair-macaulay-jenifer-ringer_n_790077.html">the one thing everyone knows about ballet</a>; and secondly the fact that, even though eating disorders are supposedly ballet&#8217;s Defining Feature, <strong>Black Swan</strong> makes no attempt to examine their specific relationship to a career that demands major energy output 24/7.</p>
<p>Plus, of course, the whole &#8216;Ah yes. She&#8217;s a dancer who wants to do well in her career. So let&#8217;s give her an eating disorder to really symbolise that drive for perfection. But eating disorders – they&#8217;re not all that SEXY are they? The BLACK SWAN must be SEXY&#8230; So let&#8217;s shove a bit of eating disorder in there, just so we know this is a film about a woman with a perfectionist streak, then forget all about it and focus on the sexy wanking and the sexy lesbian sex.&#8217;</p>
<p>Such heavy-handedness sits strangely at odds with the elegance of the dance-world – which, of course, does involve great physical hardship, a short career and an inevitable amount of luvvie backstabbing. That said, I&#8217;m not going to attempt to deny I had fun: it&#8217;s a rip-roaring yarn, and a splendid performance from Portman. But perhaps if Aronofsky had taken less time to think about how clever he considers himself, and more time to consider the intricacies of the ballet he takes as his framework, <strong>Black Swan</strong> would be less derivative, less cocky and – as a film – infinitely superior.</p>

<p>I am frequently asked, with a wry smile, &#8216;So, was your dissertation on garden implements?&#8217;, to which I invariably respond, with a smug one, &#8216;Well, yes.&#8217; You see, <em>rake</em> as &#8216;a dissolute man of fashion&#8217; derives first from <em>rake</em> as &#8216;an implement consisting of a pole with a crossbar toothed like a comb at the end&#8217; for &#8216;drawing together hay etc. or smoothing loose soil or gravel&#8217;&#8230; you know, a &#8216;rake&#8217;. In this form, the word is (at least) Old English (<em>raca</em>) from the proto-Germanic <em>rak-</em> (&#8216;to gather or heap up&#8217;), and <em>rake</em> in its many applications to people springs first and foremost from the compound term <em>rakehell</em> (c.1560). This, in turn, comes from the (apparently common) phrase &#8216;to rake out hell&#8217; (first cited around 1542), meaning &#8216;to search&#8217; or, perhaps more appropriately, &#8216;comb&#8217; out the infernal regions. A <em>rakehell</em>, then (= &#8216;an immoral person&#8217; or &#8216;a scoundrel&#8217;) is someone than whom there is no-one worse, even should you &#8216;comb through Hell&#8217;. Tut tut.</p>
<h3>Oh, what an odious Creature is a Rake!</h3>
<p>In this early incarnation, the <em>rakehell</em> is a broadly classless figure who basically spends most of his time making a nuisance of himself. By 1687, he had lost his suffix, and, in the form <em>rake</em>, became defined as &#8216;an aristocratic man of dissolute and promiscuous habits&#8217;. Historically, these &#8216;habits&#8217; boil down to drinking, swearing, whoring, and causing public disturbances (&#8216;rioting&#8217;). Ever a sensualist (and sworn enemy to <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/01/10/an-alphabet-of-femininism-13-m-is-for-marriage/">marriage</a>), his iniquities always involve sexual depravity, often grotesquely extreme: Shadwell&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Juan">Don Juan</a> feels &#8216;forced to commit a rape to pass the time&#8217;. Dr Johnson was less than impressed with such goings-on, and he defined a <em>rake</em> in his 1755 <strong>Dictionary</strong> as &#8216;A loose, disorderly, vitious, wild, gay, thoughtless fellow; a man addicted to pleasure&#8217;. Nevertheless, the true <em>rake</em> is protected from proto-ASBO consequences by his pedigree, which is the only difference between him and a &#8216;common&#8217; criminal / <em>rakehell</em>.</p>
<p>It is in this &#8216;hellish&#8217; yet aristocratic form that the <em>rake</em> first becomes defined as that archetype hanging out in the gangs&#8230;.sorry, &#8216;clubs&#8217; that the ever-hysterical Victorians dubbed &#8216;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellfire_Club">Hellfire Clubs</a>&#8216;. These were either groups of aristocrats dressing up as monks and nuns to commit acts of bestial iniquity, or sedate philosophical and political discussion groups, depending on the fruitiness of the historian. The overlap is more overlapp-y than you might think, and it relates to <em>rake</em>&#8216;s satellite term, and secondary meaning, &#8216;libertine&#8217;. As <em>lib</em>értin, this word is all over c18th French literature, which has no real cognate for <em>rake</em> as a distinct term, and it is in this form that <em>rake</em> gives us the <strong>Libertines</strong> (Pete Doherty) and <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Libertine_(2004_film)">The Libertine</a></strong> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMCYrqtmFpM">Swoony Depp</a>). Relating, as you might think, to our word <em>liberty</em> via Latin&#8217;s <em>liberta</em>, <em>libertine</em> can mean anything from &#8216;free translation&#8217; and &#8216;free thinking&#8217; (the revolutionary &#8216;<em>liberté, égalité, fraternité&#8217;</em> among other things) to the sexual excess and decadence (&#8216;freedom&#8217;, or indeed &#8216;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_love">free love</a>&#8216;) associated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wilmot,_2nd_Earl_of_Rochester">John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester</a>, and perhaps even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Doherty">Doherty</a> himself (depending on whether or not you think celebrity is the twenty-first century&#8217;s aristocracy).</p>

<h3>Set Me Free.</h3>
<p>Given this libertine background, it is unsurprising that, in its second wave as &#8216;The Order of the Monks of Medmenham&#8217;, the rakish &#8216;Hellfire Club&#8217; was associated not only with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Dashwood,_15th_Baron_le_Despencer">Sir Francis Dashwood</a> (defined by Wikipedia as &#8216;an English rake and politician&#8217;, and responsible for the horticulture displayed above, left), but also with notables like William Hogarth, the liberty-obsessed Benjamin Franklin and even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Mary_Wortley_Montagu">Lady Mary Wortley Montagu</a> (a close friend of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Astell">Mary Astell</a>, the &#8216;first feminist&#8217;).</p>
<p>Perhaps, then, this sexual excess could be connected with burgeoning ideas about general freedom, and here we must ask the obvious question: female <em>rake</em>, yes or no? The dictionary says &#8216;yes&#8217;, but cites as proof Pope&#8217;s line that &#8216;every woman is at heart a rake&#8217;, closer to an eighteenth-century &#8220;&#8216;cor, she&#8217;s askin&#8217; for it'&#8221; than acknowledged sexual equality. So, institutionally at least, the female <em>rake</em> always risks sliding into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Harlot's_Progress">Other Category</a>, as the <em>harlot</em>, which must be at least partially because women were less likely to espouse rakishness as part of a broader public life. The closest we seem to get to an actual love&#8217;em&#8217;-and-leave&#8217;em she-<em>rake</em> is the upper-middle-class lesbian: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Lister">Anne Lister</a>&#8216;s diaries record her pursuit of local girls, her habit of dressing in male garb, and her nickname &#8216;Gentleman Jack&#8217;. And of course a particularly saucy woman is always free to wear her hat <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Thomas_Gainsborough_Lady_Georgiana_Cavendish.jpg">at a &#8216;<em>rakish</em>&#8216; angle</a> (where <em>rakish</em> = &#8216;dashing, jaunty or slightly disreputable&#8217;) as modelled by the celebrity adulteress <a href="http://www.stardustmovies.com/gallery_film/(220708124738)the_duchess_movie_image_keira_knightley.jpg">Georgiana &#8216;Keira Knightley&#8217; Cavendish</a> , <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgiana_Cavendish,_Duchess_of_Devonshire">Duchess of Devonshire</a> (who was getting it on with THE Earl Grey: libertea, geddit?!!).</p>
<h3>What Women Want.</h3>
<p>Meanwhile, middle-class intellectuals were determined to shelter poor Woman from such degenerates. They had to: for even the most virtuous young ladies are dangerously susceptible to rakish charm! What is more, they always believe (poor souls) that their chaste beauty and noble virtue can save a rake from himself! (&#8230;<a href="http://blog.fjgirls.com/2010/09/18/has-katy-perry-finally-got-russell-brand-under-control/">Katy Perry</a>, anyone?) Samuel Richardson in particular seems to have lived in perpetual horror of just such folly, endlessly repeating his fear of the &#8216;dangerous but too commonly received notion that <em>a reformed rake makes the best husband</em>&#8216; and crying &#8216;But MADAM!&#8217; to those young ladies who wrote to him describing the seductive appeal of his own rake, <strong>Clarissa</strong>&#8216;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdFx1OYM_ZQ">Robert Lovelace</a>. To this, Mary Wollstonecraft:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It seems a little absurd to expect women to be more reasonable than men in their LIKINGS, and still to deny them the uncontroled use of reason. When do men FALL IN LOVE with sense? When do they, with their superior powers and advantages, turn from the person to the mind? And how can they then expect women, who are only taught to observe behaviour, and acquire manners rather than morals, to despise what they have been all their lives labouring to attain?</p>
<p>Mary Wollstonecraft, <strong>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, quite. Excuse me, I have to rearrange my hat.</p>

</div>
<p>Well, if you’re <strong>Nancy Wake</strong> you cycle alone across 500km of enemy territory in order to find replacements. Who was Nancy Wake and what made her so astonishingly badass? Let’s step back to the start of World War II to find out.</p>
<p>A New Zealand-born nurse, Wake had travelled the world before settling in France in the 1930s. At the start of the war she was living with her new husband, industrialist Henri Fiocca, in the hills outside Marseille. Within months this would be occupied territory as Western Europe fell to the rapid advance of Nazi forces.</p>
<p>With a continent falling to the horrors of war, and possessing sufficient money to live comfortably anywhere in the world, many of us might say “hmm, perhaps it’s time to move to America.” Many of us might choose to keep our heads down, live the life of a wealthy socialite – a relatively safe course of action even in wartime. But not Nancy Wake. She became involved in the Resistance, delivering supplies and acting as a courier, purchasing a vehicle to serve as an ambulance for the care of refugees. Wake became more deeply involved with the Resistance as the war continued, becoming a key figure in the escape lines that helped smuggle escapees, downed airmen and Dunkirk survivors over the Pyrenees and into Spain. (And here it should be noted that Wake was far from the only woman to go to extraordinary risks to save the lives of escapees. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_de_Jongh">Andrée de Jongh</a> of the Belgian Comète Line and countless others performed acts of extraordinary heroism to do what they saw as a necessary task.)</p>
<p>At rough estimate, the work of Wake and the rest of her escape line organisation lead to as many as a thousand people being safely smuggled out of France between the start of the war and 1943. But she didn’t stop there.</p>
<p>You see, it turned out the Gestapo didn’t approve of resistance movements or helping escaping prisoners. So strongly did they disapprove of such behaviour that by 1943 they had Wake (codenamed ‘The White Mouse’ for her ability to evade capture) listed at the top of their most wanted list, with a five million franc reward for her capture. There’s a curious sort of honour in being recognised as the Gestapo’s most wanted person, the scary sort of honour that would see most people go to ground and stop risking themselves. But not, as you’ve probably guessed by now, Nancy Wake. It would take the betrayal of her cell, her near capture, and the insistence of her fellow resistance members to get her to finally escape over the Pyrenees and safely to England via Spain. Along the way she endured four days of interrogation at the hands of the Vichy French in Toulouse, and walked away from that as if it were hardly even worth noting.</p>
<p>So, you’ve spent the last several years of your life helping escaping prisoners. You’ve narrowly avoided capture on more than one occasion, been arrested, interrogated, and hunted by the Gestapo. After a grueling journey you’re finally safe in Britain. This is where you stop, say to yourself “right, I achieved some amazing things, time to relax and let someone else finish things up,” yes?</p>
<p>No, of course not. What you do now, assuming you’re a solid brass badass like Nancy Wake, is join the Special Operations Executive. And then, after a scant few months of training you parachute back into Auvergne in central France and begin organising a guerilla warfare movement. After all, someone has to pave the way for the D-Day landings.</p>
<p>On this second round in France, now under operating under the aegis of the SOE, Wake and other men and women of the SOE led a 7,000 strong group of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maquis_%28World_War_II%29">‘Maquis’</a>, or freedom fighters. It was during this time that Wake made her marathon bike ride to retrieve the radio codes. In between gruelling cross country bike rides and organising supply drops, she also found time to lead covert attacks on Gestapo headquarters at Montlucon, and to launch a strike on the SS 2nd Panzer Division which reportedly drew such ire that the division sent fully 15,000 troops after Wake and her Maquis. As with all the previous challenges, she wasn&#8217;t put off by a mere Panzer division coming after her.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“[Nancy Wake] is the most feminine woman I know, until the fighting starts. Then, she is like five men.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8211; Henri Tardive, fellow Resistance member</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, by the end of the war in Europe Wake had been responsible for the provision of aid to refugees, the saving of hundreds of escapees’ lives, and a series of daring acts of heroism that could keep war film writers in business for decades. All of this done in the face of countless risk, and why? Because it needed doing, and she was in a position to do it, so she was damn well going to. It took 59 years for her own government to recognise her service and appoint her a Companion of the Order of Australia in honour of her achievements.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I hate wars and violence, but if they come I don&#8217;t see why we women should just wave our men a proud goodbye and then knit them balaclavas.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#8211; Nancy Wake</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">(As a final note, Wake is only one of many women whose valorous acts in World War II are worthy of note. The SOE had 39 women serving in France alone. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odette_Samson"><strong>Odette Samson</strong></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyubov_Shevtsova"><strong>Lyubov Shevtsova</strong></a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madeleine_Damerment"><strong>Madeleine Damerment</strong></a> are just some of the many others whose stories are worth knowing.)</p>

<p>This is a talk by Bruce Feiler, linked from the rather excellent <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks">TED talks</a> which I listen to every now and then. Dads and their connection with feminism <a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/10/06/fathers-4-feminism/">is something of a hot topic for me</a>, and this particularly resonated, because it concerns a man, diagnosed with cancer, planning to assemble a Council of Dads to give support and wisdom to his daughters should he die.</p>

<p>I was taken by his concept of dadhood, and his understanding and appreciation for the importance of it. He takes a tandem approach, both looking to replace the aspects of himself as a person and looking for people whose responses to &#8220;what advice would you give my daughters&#8221; he liked. The end results are surprisingly non-gender stereotyped &#8211; get over obstacles, jump in mud puddles, find a friend.</p>
<p>He also talks a lot about the importance of community in creating a whole person, and a little about the idea of a &#8220;modern man&#8221; as actively seeking a role in their child&#8217;s upbringing, which is very encouraging.</p>

<p>So it turns out that the Brotherhood really <em>are</em> watching you.</p>
<p>I rolled in to work today, sleep-deprived and with a quiff resulting from three days&#8217; worth of hair product build-up, to find that <a href="https://ubiworkshop.myshopify.com/blogs/news/2653802-home-made-assassin">the Ubisoft Workshop had linked to my previous post about sex Assassins</a>.</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;ve told you previously that the <strong>Assassin&#8217;s Creed</strong> franchise is my opiate. As anyone who has met me can confirm, the mere brush upon the subject of the games is enough to send me into a dreadful foam. My boss&#8217;s son, a kid of only 11, paled when subjected to my enthusiastic anecdotes of dumping masses and masses of dead guards into haystacks. I&#8217;m <em>stupid</em> over it.</p>
<p>Imagine my delight, then, when I found out I&#8217;d been linked to by the <em>Ubisoft Goddamn Workshop!</em> Imagine the shrieking. Imagine the foaming. Imagine the looks on my poor, long-suffering co-workers&#8217; faces as I explained the situation to them in what increasingly became a sort of hyperactive semaphore. Ubisoft Workshop!! Where most of my paypacket goes each month! Where you can, for the princely sum of five Canadian dollars, order a copy of the spin-off comic <strong>Assassin&#8217;s Creed: The Fall</strong> and have it arrive on your doorstep in an Ubisoft envelope <em>and then die of glee.</em></p>
<p>You know, hypothetically. Er.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m pretty chuffed. But I think, therefore, that&#8217;s it&#8217;s time to iron out a few kinks and go into the depth I couldn&#8217;t plumb in my first article because I had a wordcount to stick to and a point to make. Ready? Good. Let&#8217;s go.</p>
<div id="attachment_3243" style="width: 490px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/charactersandpawns.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3243" data-attachment-id="3243" data-permalink="/2011/02/08/assassins-creed-postscript-and-haystack-challenge/charactersandpawns/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/charactersandpawns.jpg?fit=600%2C688&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="600,688" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="charactersandpawns" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/charactersandpawns.jpg?fit=261%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/charactersandpawns.jpg?fit=600%2C688&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-3243" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.badreputation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/charactersandpawns.jpg?resize=480%2C550" alt="Illustration by Markgraf.

<p>I still haven&#8217;t played <strong>Assassin&#8217;s Creed: Brotherhood</strong>, yet. I know, <em>I know</em>. I&#8217;m spewing all of this from the stand-point of someone who&#8217;s mashing contentedly through <strong>Assassin&#8217;s Creed II</strong> like a boss and is wondering whether or not we&#8217;ve been treated to a better representation of women in the next one.  Reasonable, no?</p>
<p>My boyfriend, bless him, bought me the Extra Super Mega Ultra Holy Shit A Box Edition of <strong>AssCreed BroHo</strong> for Christmas, and in the extremely ostentatious box, you get picture cards of all the character classes! After wrenching myself down off the ceiling, I was extremely pleased to note that quite a few of the classes that you get to spew forth into the throats of Templar Scum are indeed ladies, and not all of them are courtesans. This is good. We have a nice library of stabby-bastard women to chose from, and they&#8217;re believably solid and real-looking, and I&#8217;m totally convinced that they could fuck guards and Templars up just as well as everyone else you&#8217;re given to play with.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also had fellow Screed Freaks telling me that, it&#8217;s okay!  <strong>Brotherhood</strong> is awash with gender equality and I&#8217;ll love every minute of it (what am I, some kind of gender equality bomb?) (no wait, that is EXACTLY what I am) &#8211; but the Assassins you recruit and send on missions aren&#8217;t characters in their own right, are they? These are wordless, voiceless pawns that you fling merrily into the faces of your enemies. The female <em>characters</em> in Screed are still looking rather few and far between.</p>
<p>There are a few bit-parts in the historical Animus sections in <strong>Assassin&#8217;s Creed II</strong> (I&#8217;m sorry, people who haven&#8217;t played the game; you&#8217;re just going to have to keep up) and there certainly appears to be a recurring theme of everyone shagging Ezio.  Which, I&#8217;m going to have to admit, I would (he probably likes boys too, right?) but it is really amazingly prevalent.  That said, there <em>are</em> a couple of female characters in <strong>Assassin&#8217;s Creed II</strong> that delighted me <em>out of my fucking tree</em>. I was deeply heartened to see <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caterina_Sforza">Caterina Sforza</a></strong> and was even more heartened to see that her backstory&#8217;s in the database. She&#8217;s brilliant! Her story is at once completely heroic and deeply upsetting, and I&#8217;d begin a rant right now about how many strong, independent women in history and fiction have often run the risk, or faced the reality, of sexual assault at some point or other, but I think that&#8217;s an axe we all have to grind (right?).  But yes; she&#8217;s <em>intense</em> and I&#8217;m really glad she&#8217;s in the game with as much face time as she gets, because now a whole generation of people will know about her who may not have done previously.  Yes!</p>
<p><strong>Rosa</strong>, a bit-part thief in&#8230; the Venice section, if I recall correctly, has the potential to be amazing, too &#8211; but this is undermined somewhat by the fact that the first time you meet her? you have to rescue her. I mean, come on. The only person I want to see Ezio rescuing, knight-to-the-aid-of-a-damsel-style, is Leonardo. But that&#8217;s probably just me.</p>
<p>The main characters that we get to see actual progression and agency from &#8211; and not just flavour &#8211; in are the ones that aren&#8217;t in the historical sections. I&#8217;m talking <strong>Lucy Stillman</strong> and the fucking brilliant <strong>Rebecca</strong>, and I was a little bit sad that <strong>Assassin&#8217;s Creed II</strong> gives us far fewer outside-the-Animus sections for us to enjoy her in! I want a spin-off game of just her, kicking people in the face (which she notably never does) and forming emotional attachments to machinery.</p>
<p><strong>Assassin&#8217;s Creed II</strong> does some things wrong (it&#8217;s quite a lot like a courtesan-and-victim smorgasbord, and anyone arguing that &#8220;<em>that&#8217;s</em> what women <em>were</em> in those days!&#8221; will get an internet punch, because they weren&#8217;t and to assume otherwise is <em>stupid</em>) and some things right (REBECCAAAAAA, REBECCA I LOVE YOU REBECCAAAA, SHAUN AIN&#8217;T GOT NOTHING ON ME, REBECCAAAAA, etc.), and is <em>certainly</em> doing a whole lot better than the first game, which had Lucy and Maria, the Robert du Sable cosplayer and&#8230; well, that was that.</p>
<p>And then <strong>Brotherhood</strong>, apparently, does it all better <em>again,</em> and I am deathly excited to see how, given the mixed success of the previous games. This franchise, as I will shout until I&#8217;m blue in the face to anyone who&#8217;ll listen, is one that&#8217;s going from strength to strength and is (perhaps most importantly) the child of people who give a shit about representation and who&#8217;s playing their game &#8211; as my previous article getting picked up on shows. I just wanted to reassure you that <strong>Assassin&#8217;s Creed</strong> isn&#8217;t a franchise swamped and blinded by the Frank Miller Effect wholesale. Don&#8217;t rule it out. And especially don&#8217;t rule it out where the Brotherhood can get to you, <em>because they will</em>.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">QUEEN</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>To sour your happiness, I must report<br />
The queen is dead.</p>
<p>Shakespeare, <strong>Cymbeline</strong> (1611) V.5.3400</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Queen</em> is one of the few Alphabet words with a firmly British origin, but it makes up for its lack of Latinate pedigree by being extremely complicated. So this is the part where the rap breaks down &#8211; it comes from the Old English <em>cwen</em>, the proto-Germanic <em>kwoeniz</em>, and (follow it back far enough) the proto-Indo-European <em>gwen</em> (= &#8216;woman, wife&#8217;). Proto-awesome, man. In this form it coincides rather nicely with the Greek <em>gyne</em>, meaning &#8216;woman, wife&#8217; (thus <em>gynecology</em>, <em>misoGYNy</em>, <em>gynophobia</em>, and indeed <em>gynocentric</em>), and a whole host of other languages that I don&#8217;t think we need all up in our grill just now.</p>
<h3>My Family and Other Animals</h3>
<p>The interesting thing about these origins is their relation to another word: <em>quean</em>, originally a variant form of <em>queen</em>, meaning then &#8216;woman, female&#8217; but now mostly an &#8216;effeminate homosexual man&#8217; (cf., er, <em>queen</em>). Its etymology is similar, but with more emphasis on the insults: thus, <em>quean</em>&#8216;s forebears include the Middle Dutch <em>quene</em> (= &#8216;older woman&#8217;), the Dutch <em>kween</em> (= &#8216;hussy&#8217;) and the Middle Low German <em>quene</em> (= &#8216;woman, wife, old woman&#8217;). It eventually gives us &#8216;a promiscuous woman&#8217; sometime around the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>As is often the case, plenty of forebears inevitably only leads to plenty of embarrassing cousins, and many of these roots (<em>cwen</em> and the Greek <em>gyne</em> in particular) have also been claimed as parents to <em>cunt</em> ( =  &#8216;the vulva or vagina&#8217;), spelled <em>quaint</em> and sometimes <em>queynt</em> by Chaucer, just to illustrate the fluidity of &#8216;cw&#8217;, &#8216;qu&#8217; and &#8216;cu&#8217;. When you know that <em>portcwene</em> ( = literally &#8216;a public woman&#8217;) means &#8216;prostitute&#8217;, the association of <em>quean / quean</em> and <em>cunt</em> may perhaps become somewhat clearer: it&#8217;s what you might call <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synecdoche">synecdoche</a>. This may also throw some light on <em>quean/queen</em>&#8216;s gay associations: inevitably, words that suggest penetration of the female (<em><a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/01/31/an-alphabet-of-femininism-16-p-is-for-pussy/">pussy</a>, bitch</em>) are eventually seized upon to denigrate an &#8216;effeminate&#8217; man. <em>Queen</em> as &#8216;a flamboyant homosexual&#8217; is from the 1920s (as is <em>queer</em>, which originally means &#8216;oblique, off centre&#8217;), thus coinciding with a modicum more gay visibility than its sixteenth century usage.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not all doom, gloom and back to the Unmentionables: let&#8217;s talk thrones. English is unusual in giving a <em>queen</em> her own word, and not simply feminizing <em>king</em> (= &#8216;of noble birth&#8217;) &#8211; compare the French <em>roi</em> and <em>reine</em>, from the Latin <em>rex</em> and <em>regina.</em> Nonetheless, the first definition of a <em>queen</em> in the dictionary is as &#8216;a king&#8217;s wife or consort; a lady who is wife to a king&#8217; but the second sense, as &#8216;a woman who is the chief ruler of a state, having the same rank and position as a king&#8217;, is Old English itself, so the two definitions are likely to be essentially simultaneous.</p>
<h3>The English the English the English are best.</h3>
<p>Yes, over here on Albion&#8217;s chalk-ringed shores, we&#8217;ve had no less than seven reigning <em>queens</em>. By contrast, even pre-1789, the hated French would never let Ringo have a go &#8211; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salic_law">lol Salic law</a> – and all their famous female royals were lowly consorts (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_of_Valois">Margaret de Valois</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_de'_Medici">Catherine de Medici</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Antoinette">Marie Antoinette</a>&#8230;), although <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_IV_of_France">Henri IV</a> was several degrees more awesome than any English king, ever. <a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/_RMP5gGGaNA0/SdS53BcjXSI/AAAAAAAAC6g/hH7lkbHAZhw/s320/henry-iv.jpg">Look at how pleased with himself he is</a>! But I digress.</p>
<p>However positive the existence of historical female monarchs on this <a href="http://www.quotes.net/quote/5427">royal throne of kings, this sceptr&#8217;d isle</a>, the residual physicality of <em>queen</em> in relation to <em>cunt</em> is still lurking around, and the body of the <em>queen</em> has always carried a significance that goes beyond everyday concerns about legitimacy (although those are there too). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_of_Aragon">Catherine of Aragon</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_of_Cleves">Anne of Cleves</a>, queens to Henry VIII, were both publicly subjected to a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/oct/30/catherine-aragon-giles-tremlett-review">series of intimate questions</a> (and threatened physical examination) about their wedding-bed virginity, genital health and sexual history, and that&#8217;s before you get into discussions down the pub throughout history about When The King Is A Queen (thus <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_II_of_England#Edward_and_Piers_Gaveston">Edward II</a> roundly condemned for A Weak King and put to an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_II_of_England#Death">&#8216;ironic&#8217; death</a>), and the reigning <em>queen</em>&#8216;s menstrual cycle and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_of_Modena#Queen_.281685.E2.80.931689.29">likelihood of producing a royal heir</a>.</p>
<p>This last was an issue that clearly dogged even those English queens ruling in their own right: in 1554, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_I_of_England">Mary I</a> was declared to be with child, triggering thanksgiving services and country-wide celebration, until over a year later her belly decreased in size and the &#8216;pregnancy&#8217; was revealed to be a humiliating &#8216;phantom&#8217; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_pregnancy">pseudocyesis</a>), caused by her intense desire for an heir. After a second false pregnancy two years later, she died (possibly from a uterine tumour) in 1558.</p>

<p>A couple of hundred years later, amid some of the most spectacular changes in British history, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_II_of_England">Mary &#8216;Williamanmary&#8217; II</a> and her sister, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne,_Queen_of_Great_Britain">Anne</a>, were competing to be the first to bear a child, and, in consequence, were rarely on speaking terms. Mary had an early miscarriage which may have permanently impaired her ability to have a baby, while Anne (despite being fairly definitely gay herself) had six children who died, eight still-births and four miscarriages. Meanwhile, a few Georges and a William later, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Victoria">Victoria</a>&#8216;s famous fruitfulness was widely seen as a positive statement about British greatness in an imperial age: the truly maternal monarch, whose offspring gave England royal relations in Hesse, Prussia (though post-1914 we didn&#8217;t talk about that), and Russia (oops).</p>
<h3>Queen Of My Heart.</h3>
<p>But, of course, we (along with everyone else, ho ho) have not touched on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_I_of_England">Elizabeth I</a>, the &#8216;Virgin Queen&#8217;, Gloriana, etc who managed to make a virtue of childlessness by representing the immaculate body of the queen as the symbol of a healthy nation. Bang on cue, <em>queen</em>&#8216;s third meaning is &#8216;a female whose rank or pre-eminence is comparable to that of a queen; applied, for example, to the Virgin Mary, to the goddesses of ancient religions or mythologies, or to a woman as a term of endearment or honour&#8217;. This is the sense it has in <strong>Twelfth Night</strong> when Viola is &#8216;Orsino&#8217;s mistress and his fancy&#8217;s <em>queen</em>&#8216;, in which context it has something of <em><a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2010/12/20/an-alphabet-of-femininism-12-l-is-for-lady/">lady</a></em> about it, just ramped up to full throttle: someone who is also the &#8216;chief  ruler of a state&#8217; is indeed a mistress <em>par excellence.</em></p>
<p>It was this tradition that Elizabeth milked till it had no more to give, presenting herself as the adored <em>lady</em> at the centre of a courtly cult of virginity, an age which produced Edmund Spenser&#8217;s <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Faerie_Queene">The Faerie Queene</a></strong> and Walter Raleigh&#8217;s <strong><a href="http://www.luminarium.org/renlit/oceanintro.htm">The Ocean To Cynthia</a></strong>, as well as hundreds of portraits depicting Queen Elizabeth as immaculate goddess and virgin. Her fleshlessness was only exacerbated after 1592, when the elderly <em>queen</em> stopped sitting for portraits at all, forcing artists to work from earlier templates of her face, creating an eternal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portraiture_of_Elizabeth_I_of_England#The_last_sitting_and_the_Mask_of_Youth">&#8216;Mask of Youth&#8217;</a>.</p>
<p>So <em>queen</em> is a word that fuses sexuality and a microscopic focus on the body (where more so than in its use to attack people for what they like to do in the bedroom?) with a kind of awestruck &#8216;Glorianian&#8217; respect. Those who sit on this lexical pedestal are perhaps a little wonky: it is unfortunate that <em>queenly</em> success seems attainable only for those rulers who have produced litters of miniature monarchs and the one who maintained a virginal ice-princess sort of deal. But then, looking back over England&#8217;s history (and, of course, its present), it is cheering to see that Women Have At Least Done It. Now if we could just fix that male primogeniture business&#8230;</p>

<p>In <strong><a href="http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/02/02/why-are-trending-topic-hashtags-so-sexist-part-1/">my previous post</a></strong> I gave some examples of standard sexist trending topic hashtag fare and examined some theories I have heard about why they&#8217;re so popular.  Here&#8217;s my two cents.</p>

<p id="caption-attachment-2915" class="wp-caption-text">Hashstag, by Rakka</p>
</div>
<p>Twitter hashtags make conversations and exchanges that would previously have been invisible to anyone not involved in them available to everyone. You can stick your head out of your own online bubble and peer into someone else’s. If you listen in to a conversation on a bus or in a bar you’ll often get a similar effect, and if you ever share a train carriage with a stag party you may well overhear some of the same sentiments.</p>
<p>There are a lot of possibilities and interesting conversations growing out of this (here’s a good <a href="https://mashable.com/2010/10/14/twitter-cross-cultural/">Mashable post</a> about cross-cultural conversations) but it can be uncomfortable having a front row seat for the social reproduction of gender stereotypes in real time.</p>
<h3>Tweeting gender</h3>
<p>[Apologies to any gender theorists out there for this next bit, in which I will be oversimplifying some complex ideas.]</p>
<p>[Oh and just to be clear, when I&#8217;m talking about men and women I don&#8217;t mean <em>all</em> men or <em>all</em> women, and I know those categories are far more fluid than our friends the hashtaggers would like to admit.]</p>
<p>Part of the Great Promise of the internet was that in the gap between your avatar and your fingertips on the keyboard all kinds of subversive genderfuck fun was to be had. And it is being had (hooray!), but there’s a tangible disappointment in some areas that the web is used as much to police and reinforce gendered ideas of appropriate behaviour as it is to undermine them. Social networks, it turns out, are simply another arena in which to enact and consolidate gender identity. Like the bus, like the pub.</p>
<p>And a big part of successfully Being A Man or Being A Woman is policing the behaviour of others. By laying down the rules you’re letting everyone know you understand them. In fact you’re an expert. By calling out someone else on their inappropriate behaviour (for example, women that are ‘loud’ &#8211; how unfeminine!) you’re picking up gender points for yourself. And appropriate gender behaviour points <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=F7vd7JQ4zlcC&amp;pg=PA391&amp;lpg=PA391&amp;dq=appropriate+gender+behaviour+rewards&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oIgpBlhobo&amp;sig=FIG-3K8iC2TbO_Qb7Co11WKNNKY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=9WQ7TfrbFtOxhQfZ__zNCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">win prizes</a>!</p>
<p>You can see this in action in the huge numbers of women participating in sexist hashtags and imparting helpful advice to their own gender:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>#rulesforgirls stoppp being so easyyyy!</p>
<p>#ihatefemaleswho act like they in to sports</p>
<p>#agoodwoman sucks her mans dick w|. out no hesitation lOl.</p>
<p>#agoodwoman aims to please</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks for that. Now I&#8217;m all set. In another recent hashtag, #youneedanewboyfriend, large numbers of male and female Twitter users took the opportunity to remind everyone that male femininity = gay! Which as we all know = very bad indeed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>your man has more clothes with different shades of pink than you.#youneedanewboyfriend</p>
<p>If your man turns down sex from you, #youneedanewboyfriend</p>
<p>#youneedanewboyfriend If he knows all the words to every @ladygaga song out there #notnormal</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s not just about putting women in their place, it&#8217;s about keeping men in line as well. If you can do both that makes you the Manliest Man of all, and king of all you survey. The tweets I quoted in the first post are part of this process. On the one hand encouraging traditionally feminine behaviours, and on the other boosting the masculinity points of the men tweeting, and asserting their dominance and entitlement (consider yourself lucky if you missed #itaintrape – that one was Not Nice).</p>
<p>What I think is happening here is that a large number of people are using a new medium to do exactly what an even larger number of people have already been doing for centuries, millennia, even. What’s different is that the isolated conversations are being collected and shared on a global platform.</p>
<h3>What now?</h3>

<p>The flagrant misogyny of most of these trending topic hashtag tweets makes me furiously angry. But I don&#8217;t find them shocking. I think Germaine Greer is wrong on lots of things but right on this one: “Women have very little idea of how much men hate them.” Well, now we have a handy index in our Twitter sidebar. The scale of the problem is intimidating, I agree, but being shocked isn’t going to help.</p>
<p>The good news is we don&#8217;t need to start a cultural revolution from scratch. There’s some excellent work already going on: for example, <a href="http://www.womankind.org.uk/uk-schools.html">Womankind</a> and <a href="http://www.pinkstinks.co.uk/">PinkStinks</a> are challenging misogyny and sexist attitudes among young people (who seem like the obvious group to start with, to my mind).</p>
<p>There are also lots of truly wonderful online projects that are trying to break down some of these poisonous stereotypes and ideas. BadRep is one, of course ;-) .  But another of my favourites is <a href="http://genderfork.com/">Genderfork</a> – follow them on Twitter for the perfect antidote to all this #rulesforgirls/boys crap.</p>
<p>What else can we do? Mocking the hashtags is fun. Hijacking them is fun too. It might not overthrow the sexist idiot regime, but if it makes just one person stop and think then it&#8217;s surely worth it. Another blogger on the topic of hashtags suggested getting some feminist hashtags circulating. Suggestions included #feminist and #ilovemybody. That&#8217;d be nice for other feminists, but I can’t see how they’d have very wide appeal, particularly because they don’t invite people to personalise them.</p>
<p>So I’m going to end with a challenge: <strong>can we come up with a funny, pro-feminist / genderfuck hashtag people might actually use?</strong></p>
