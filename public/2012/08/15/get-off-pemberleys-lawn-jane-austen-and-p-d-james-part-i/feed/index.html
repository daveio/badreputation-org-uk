					<description><![CDATA[Hooray! Thanks for writing this. It sends me into a rage when people dismiss Austen as Regency &#039;chick-lit&#039; (a term which is PROBLEMATIC in itself of course) For my EngLit degree at a so-called &#039;elite&#039; university we managed to do a whole term on 18thC literature without studying a single Austen novel. WELL DONE CAMBRIDGE, This Is Why I Hate You Reason No.57

And the idea that Austen is trivial because she only writes about marriage and relationships and love and GIRLY STUFF rather than important MANLY subjects like war or bears is such a fucking joke. What the hell do they think Anna Karenina is about? Or The Great Gatsby? Or The Rainbow? The Canterbury Tales? That&#039;s not how literature works, guys.]]></description>
