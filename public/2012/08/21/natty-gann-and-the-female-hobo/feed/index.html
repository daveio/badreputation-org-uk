					<description><![CDATA[I totally remember seeing this movie when I was a kid... my sense of wanderlust and female badassery was really just developing and this movie just made me want to adventure more...

I totally forgot about the whole emotion tugging aspects of the movie... I just remember the girl and her adventure]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2012/08/21/natty-gann-and-the-female-hobo/#comment-5049&quot;&gt;Miranda&lt;/a&gt;.

Not really, but my reading wasn&#039;t exactly, er, comprehensive. In Joan Crouse&#039;s book she recommends Nan Cinnater&#039;s book &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Women_Hoboes_of_the_Great_Depression_192.html?id=WPRzNwAACAAJ&#038;redir_esc=y&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Women Hoboes of the Great Depression&lt;/a&gt;which apparently includes &quot;some of the only material available on black women transients&quot; but I couldn&#039;t find a copy online. 

I just had a quick google and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.solidarity-us.org/node/464&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt; this book looks pretty interesting  and the comment in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/general-article/rails-added-obstacles/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; is quite telling I think: &quot;While tales of friendships among hobos that transcended race abound, many African American hobos recounted being made to feel like outcasts among outcasts.&quot;

But no, I think The Hobo as he exists in Americana is generally white. Like women I suspect the stories of black homeless travellers have not been admitted to the folklore because their experiences undermined the romanticized ideals of the wandering lifestyle.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Did anything you read mention race at all? When I was proofing this I found myself wondering about whether the &quot;hobo&quot; is predominantly a white archetype in Americana,and what the genuine truth of this assumption would be. 

Given segregation and oppressive poverty, and the issue of what &quot;freedom to wander&quot; would be afforded a person of colour, I think it is also difficult to romanticise wanderers of colour without hitting some very problematic issues. Then there&#039;s the predominantly white &quot;okies and arkies&quot; dustbowl imagery evoked by (say) The Grapes of Wrath etc (which contains almost no POC if memory serves, unlike Of Mice and Men or Steinbeck&#039;s urban writing, and which contains a line delivered by Ma Joad where she talks of the family as descended from the pioneers of the Revolution). Steinbeck isn&#039;t hobo literature per se, but I thought of Grapes somehow. 

... I&#039;m rambling. 

Anyway, here is a woman of colour we wrote about last year who did do quite a lot of wandering: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/10/12/unsung-heroes-stagecoach-mary-fields/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Stagecoach Mary Fields&lt;/a&gt;.]]></description>
