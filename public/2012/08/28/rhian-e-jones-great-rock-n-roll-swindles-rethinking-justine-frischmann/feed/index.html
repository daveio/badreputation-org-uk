					<description><![CDATA[Twenty years after their debut album I still wonder why Elastica did not get massive here in the U.S. All the valid points you bring up(tabloid fodder, Brit pop, stealing riffs,etc.) meant nothing here. Justine/Elastica had a clean slate. Their record company could have marketed them however they saw fit. Sky was the limit. Other than Connection being a minor hit and their brief touring here, they were a popcorn fart in US pop culture.

I see no missing ingredients. The catchy songs are there. She&#039;s incredibly hot. They have &quot;attitude&quot;. The live performances of the songs sound better than the album. After the Letterman performance, people should have been running in droves to the record store.

That debut album is lightning in a bottle. Nobody here cared. A shame.]]></description>
