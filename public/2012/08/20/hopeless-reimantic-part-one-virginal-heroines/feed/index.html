Buying her security -- I don&#039;t know.  Security is a long term, and not very sexy thing.  Their relationship sounds very unequal, and I&#039;d have thought unstable.  Not that (as far as I know) I&#039;ve ever met a millionaire.  Perhaps impoverished heroines are what millionaires are looking for... someone with whom to share their millions unstintingly...  Maybe I&#039;m just an old cynic.

Also security makes me think &#039;maximum security&#039;, as in prisons.]]></description>

Pet, the story is a fairly standard &quot;impoverished heroine swept off her feet by millionaire&quot; one - I assume what is bought is...her...

...

You know, that&#039;s actually a very good question. He buys her...security? Maybe that&#039;s the idea? I don&#039;t know. I&#039;m not sure the publishers thought the title through all the way.

(And the heroine is bought by a young, sexy man&#039;s gold, because otherwise it wouldn&#039;t be romantic.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[At risk of stating the obvious, I suppose that the high value placed on virginity stems from the fact that, before modern paternity tests, the only way in which a man could be certain that he was the father of a child was if the mother had never had sex with anyone else.  (Given how easy it is to determine the mother of a child, it would have made a lot more sense for titles and property to descend through the female line.  Patriarchy made a rod for its own back.)

A bizarre and unpleasant example of valuing virginity comes to mind.  An ex-partner&#039;s uncle owned a pedigree bitch who conceived a litter of non-pedigree puppies.  There&#039;s nothing remarkable about that, except that -- my ex-partner told me -- the uncle had the poor creature put down, in the strange belief that sex with a non-pedigree animal &#039;spoilt&#039; a pedigree bitch.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think I&#039;d prefer not to read &#039;Bought: Destitute Yet Defiant&#039;, but wonder what (or who?) is bought.  I&#039;m put in mind of &#039;A Bird in a Gilded Cage&#039;:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Bird_in_a_Gilded_Cage

And her beauty was sold,
For an old man&#039;s gold,

Bought and sold are, after all, the same transaction viewed from different perspectives.  I assume that the beauty of the &#039;Bought: Destitute Yet Defiant&#039; heroine was not bought by an old man&#039;s gold.]]></description>
