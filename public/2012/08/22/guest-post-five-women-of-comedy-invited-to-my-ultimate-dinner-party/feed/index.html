					<description><![CDATA[Great list. Great post.

I&#039;d have had Julia Davis on there too. She&#039;s dark, funny, smart. Everything that male comedians are commended for. Nighty Night was amazing for similar reasons as Ab Fab - women who aren&#039;t good, they&#039;re bad and unapologetically so.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great choices! I&#039;d like to be a fly on the wall. I particularly like the range of humour styles from Moran&#039;s all-caps joie-de-vivre to Carter&#039;s quiet but incisive wisdom.

Here are mine:

1) Issa Rae, creator of Misadventures of an Awkward Black Girl: http://www.awkwardblackgirl.com/

2) Sally Outen, stand-up comic who made me double over with laughter in a Vauxhall pub: http://www.lashings.org/sally/

3) Grace Nichols, poet. She has a gentle sort of humour that used to cheer me up when I was in my mid-teens my mum blu-tacked a copy of her poem &quot;give yourself a hug&quot; by the mirror in my room: http://literature.britishcouncil.org/grace-nichols

4) Marjane Satrapi, author and illustrator. Persepolis also made me cry, but its humour is beautifully expressed, wry and brave: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjane_Satrapi

5) Kate Beaton, illustrator. The webcomic I have cried with nerdy laughter at: http://www.harkavagrant.com

....I might make a post out of this comment!]]></description>
