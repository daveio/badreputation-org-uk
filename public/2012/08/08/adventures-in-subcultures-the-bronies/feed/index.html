You want to show people a different view on bronies, so you link a something awful page...
Genius!!!
The page is satire at best, although the writing style shows more of hate and anger in the author.
 &quot;By now I&#039;m sure you all know of the latest weird obsession that has taken the less socially adept parts of the internet by storm: My Little Pony, Friendship is Magic. You probably also know of the fandom of 14 to 40-something awkward (mostly) men who worship the show, known as bronies. If you haven&#039;t been introduced to bronies yet, you&#039;re probably better off just leaving now. This thread was created because the Awkward and Ugly thread was getting absolutely inundated with brony pictures. Nobody can seem to find a brony meet-up picture that isn&#039;t at least somewhat awkward or ugly, so they all qualify for that thread and are drowning out everything else. This gives you an idea of what you&#039;re in for if you stay. 

If you&#039;re intent on staying, this thread is for posting pictures and videos of bronies and brony meetups and laughing at them. This thread is also for finding/exploring brony websites and forums and posting weird and funny poo poo they say and do. 

This thread is NOT for discussion of My Little Pony itself, organising of brony meet-ups, or talking about how your fedora totally doesn&#039;t make you look like an idiot. 
Here&#039;s some other rules, requested by Butt Wizard&quot;

Quoted from the thread, If that does not show the bias going into what they are saying, you can see by reading some of the posts.
These people seem to be angry that bronies exist, and want to waste their time trying to spread false accusations about the fandom, and seem to want to be validated in their hatred of us.

I&#039;m not saying the odd/awkward/nasty parts of the community aren&#039;t there, but this thread wants to portray the extreme as the average. Now lets go into some examples from the thread.

Brony: An adult male that has become obsessed with the children&#039;s cartoon show My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic. Usually identifiable by a complete bankruptcy of muscletone and a mysterious abundance of free time and disposable income to spend on My Little Pony merchandise. A blighting presence on the internet. Also a very, very embarrassed little town in Poland.- This is the immaturity of these people. They categorize all bronies into weird losers, and the writing style is enough to make you realize the anger in the writer.

 Pegasister: A female brony. Extremely rare, generally overweight.- this site is pro feminism, and you link people to something that says this, great logic there.

I&#039;m pretty sure any competent person can see past the exaggeration/lies.
Ex. of exaggeration: Cupcakes is a dark story about murder, and is popular. Grimdark fanfics are not usually popular, but most people tolerate them. Cupcakes is one of the grimdark fanfictions that became a standout and a fanfiction that was read for curiosity and to be in the know about it, apart from the people that enjoy grimdark. Fallout: Equestria is not all about killing. It&#039;s based on fallout, so there is violence, but the characters and story are why it is popular.
Lies: Bronies send Lauren Faust porn and get mad when she blocks them. I&#039;m pretty sure people know that sending porn to someone usually doesn&#039;t get a good response. And Lauren has dealt with the trolls that try to send her those images to try to get her to be disgusted with bronies as a whole, no actual bronies that I&#039;m aware of.

If you want facts about bronies, go to actual articles like the one on this site, rather than a thread about Brony hate.]]></description>

Edit: I derped.  I was referring to the song and moral of &quot;Suited for Success&quot; (Season 1, Episode 14).  The one that hooked me was Applebuck Season, Season 1/Episode 04, which dealt with self-imposed overwork.  Season 2, Episode 3, &quot;Lesson Zero&quot; treated it even better, but by that time my brain had already gone to the pony side.]]></description>

&quot;MLP is actually a cute &#038; hopeful look at 20-30 something life&quot;

This.  Anybody who&#039;s ever done web design or any form of consultancy work will appreciate &quot;Art of the Dress&quot;, the episode that got me permanently hooked.  The point of the episode being that sometimes the customer *isn&#039;t* always right, and that it doesn&#039;t matter how much you want to be their friend, sometimes you have to put your hoof down and deliver what they needed, even if it&#039;s not precisely what they wanted.

Fun fact, Scootaloo is a disabled character with a bigger role. She is actually incapable of flying and likely never will. Or at least that is what the mapping from Lauren Faust would state though as seen from DHX and the writers things can change.]]></description>

Hate is a strong word. I could understand to what extent people could dislike Fluttershy, but the fact is it all comes down to preference. People who often like Twilight the most will usually be polar opposite to that of Pinkie Pie and Fluttershy. Hate would only be viable if the characters legitimately insulted them in some way and considering how the show is, I highly doubt that possible.]]></description>
