					<description><![CDATA[Hmmmm. I felt Katniss becomes more passive with each book and while I dig her stoicism, it does seem that she never has any agency of her own - all her actions are actually reactions. She very rarely takes the lead, and while I kinda like that, I also sometimes want to make her a bit more &#039;with it&#039;. I like how she becomes more morally compromised and fucked up by the whole situation and that goes some way to forgiving Collins for making sure she never purposefully killed anyone in the first book except in clear self defence or mercy. Which, given her complicity in the rest of the Hunger Games, was a bit too wishy washy for my liking.

But I completely agree with your views on the boys. I spent a lot of the books thinking &#039;is this meant to be a love triangle?&#039; because I couldn&#039;t see how anyone was meant to favour Gale - it was so clear that Peeta was the best choice in any circumstances and that she has to willingly accept the idea of peace and forgiveness before she can embrace Peeta who embodies those aspects. I did hate, however, the whole &#039;I didn&#039;t want kids but then a man convinced me it would be ok and now look, yay, a mother, as all women should be&#039; bit. That really pissed me off.]]></description>
