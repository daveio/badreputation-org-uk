					<description><![CDATA[To be a little bit blunt, I had high hopes that Ashoka would grant the female audience a most believable portrayal of a padawan progressively taking her place in the grander scheme of things, but the truth of the show is that she is a Mary Sue, typically uppity, at times outright disrespectful and chaotic towards her mentor, and since she most notoriously gets &#039;everything right&#039; on the first go, as opposed to him, she&#039;s just another power girl on a typical power girl trip. The lack of normality and true humility alongside the traits of becoming a jedi master turned me away from the show. Many fans dislike her attitude, and so do I. You can be a girl, you can have power, and you can act and it all out in a presentable way without disrupting every ongoing process around you, because all the heads keep turning. You don&#039;t need all of the attention, all the time. Ashoka though, leaves little room for anything but.]]></description>
