					<description><![CDATA[Just as a point of information. It was heavily in the marketing and press coming out of bioware/EA that femshep was going to be on the cover of the game (albeit on the reverse of the default male shep). I subscribed to way too many youtube/rss feeds on gaming news just to hear about ME3. I found the lesson from playing ME2 and ME3 is that you get treated differently on the basis of your gender (i.e. Garrus doesn&#039;t fancy my broshep :( )

I know your review is coming up soon, but I do want to share that i am looking forward to enkindling my gay relationship with Kaidan in my second play. It&#039;s so cool to have a game embrace male homosexuality. Shame about the ending...]]></description>
