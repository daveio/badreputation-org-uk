Yay! Hannah liked her too in Part 1, and I think she might be my favourite so far. It sounds like it manages the happy fairytale ending quite deftly.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was interested in all of these - I have a particular 7 yr old in mind that I&#039;d like to buy a birthday present for (she&#039;s at a reading age of 5). Her parents have recently gone through a messy divorce and her mum is needing a lot of support. I liked the idea of a book with a strong female lead. But why do they all have to be about marriage? I worry that the stories where the princesses choose not to marry will cause her confusion over her parents divorce, or even worse to blame her father. Are there any princesses that get to wear pretty dresses, slay dragons and aren&#039;t constantly pursued by men (whether the choose to marry or not)?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would nominate books by Deva Fagan: Fortune&#039;s Folly, The Magical Misadventures of Prunella Bogthistle, and Circus Galacticus.  None are specifically &quot;and then the princess goes forth and does awesome&quot;, but they are very much in that vein.  (For instance, in Fortune&#039;s Folly, the protaganist becomes a princess for having gone forth and been awesome in a somewhat subversive manner.)

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d like to nominate Princess Adrienne from the kids comic series Princeless (available in trade form soon!) http://www.actionlabcomics.com/comics/

She is sent to a Dragon guarded tower by her father the king in order to wait out a suitable knight to rescue her, marry her and prove himself worthy of inheriting the Kingdom. When she finds a sword under her bed, she teams up with the dragon and flies off to rescue her sisters.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2012/03/28/kickass-princesses-part-1/#comment-2235&quot;&gt;hebby&lt;/a&gt;.

Absolutely - the quick, resourceful, &quot;clever Gretchen&quot; type is a big deal in folk tales throughout Europe (and possibly elsewhere, but that&#039;s what I&#039;ve read). Not many are princesses, though - I think most of the attempts above are trying to subvert the Charles Perrault model. 

Hasn&#039;t Cat Valente recently done something on Maria Morevna? I must give it a read...

I think it&#039;s notable that a lot of these picture books are from the 70s and 80s - and I&#039;d be interested to see, in the aftermath of the Disney Princess brand really blowing up in the 90s and 00s, whether the same amount of subversive storytelling is still about. I feel like there are less of these books out there, but I&#039;d need to research it... and of course, we&#039;ve had Shrek, too, where the princess is an ogre, and stays one!]]></description>
