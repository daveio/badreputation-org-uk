					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m given to understand that, for the larger-breasted woman (like my wife) an underwire can be a deeply functional thing - it does the bulk of the holding, as such, and without it much discomfort would ensue.

Good article!  Bra adverts really aren&#039;t very good at marketing to women.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I deeply approve of vests.  I deeply detest bras.  I feel you are a kindred spirit in this terrible mess of lingerie.  Huzzah!

However, as a pedant who speaks Spanish, the original Shakira song doesn&#039;t have &quot;humble&quot; in it at all... that&#039;s just an add-on to fit with the rhythm and required syllables to make it work in English.

(Sorry - I can&#039;t help it when Spanish is involved)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[OH god the horror/depression of bra shopping. I require a fair bit of mammary management (a phrase which has been making me giggle for half an hour now ;p) and until recently there was nowhere local that sold my size, instead I had to plan trips away around Bravissimo locations... The sizes/fit between makes varies so much (WHY? WHY is one 36 an inch shorter than another 36?) that buying online is a bit of gamble, trying them on is the only way to be sure.
I do get very excited now by all the colours and pretty in bravissimo after years of being relegated to black, white or beige. They also do nice vests with built in bras ;) I just wish I didn&#039;t have to get on a bloody plane to buy them!]]></description>
