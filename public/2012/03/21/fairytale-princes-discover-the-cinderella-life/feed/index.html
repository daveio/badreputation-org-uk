					<description><![CDATA[On the good=beautiful, evil=ugly trope, I am reminded of a fairytale I was told at school, where the Queen was visited by a chaotic neutral fairy upon giving birth to her daughter, who made it so the baby was the most beautiful ever born, but also the most stupid.  She then visited a poor woman, and made it so her newborn son was the cleverest child ever born, but also the ugliest.  Where the story goes is relatively obvious (I don&#039;t recall the exact details), but I do remember the ending having a twist where the Princess hadn&#039;t actually wished the ugly kid handsome, but had - by wishing herself cleverer - discovered the ability to see beauty in him.  I always though that was nice.  Though it kinda cemented a childish ideal of female=pretty and male=ugly for me.]]></description>
