					<description><![CDATA[I absolutely loved this film (for the reasons you have mentioned - pirates! science! claymation!) and I didn&#039;t even think about the particular feminist interpretation you&#039;ve had of it. I did think Cutlass Liz was a bit too sexy for a lady pirate, but also that Queen Victoria was incredible, both for your points and also because how often do  you see a film portraying Queen Victoria as anything but repressed and aloof?

What I did like was how Cutlass Liz and the pirate voiced by Lenny Henry (can&#039;t remember his name) had a laugh together and high-fived; it felt as if they were on an equal footing, and again with the Fancy Mustache Pirate (who arrived in the whale) they were joking and laughing. I liked that she was placed as an equal among them, despite the wiggling and the lack of screen time.

I would&#039;ve also liked to see Suspiciously Curvaceous Pirate do a little more (like kick some ass) but I&#039;m unbelievably glad they didn&#039;t get Pirate Captain and SCPirate together at the end, despite the fact she clearly fancied him. That would&#039;ve been annoying.

Also: HAM NIGHT!]]></description>
