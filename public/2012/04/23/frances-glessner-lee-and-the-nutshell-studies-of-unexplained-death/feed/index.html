Hi Susan - thanks for taking the time to read the post and comment! I loved your film, but I must admit  it wasn&#039;t quite what I expected. Not just the feminist thread running through it but also because it was more thoughtful and reflective than I thought it was going to be, almost philosophical. I guess I was expecting something a bit more schlocky, but was very pleasantly surprised. Did you have much control over the marketing? I wonder if maybe some feminists just missed the film altogether? I was very glad I didn&#039;t miss it anyway :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sarah - 
Thanks so much for writing about Frances Glessner Lee and my film, Of Dolls &#038; Murder. It&#039;s interesting to note that female feminists, aside from you, have completely ignored my film. (At least so far). Men, on the other hand, absolutely love it. I&#039;m sure many of those men who engage me in deep conversation about Frances Glessner Lee would also consider themselves feminists. 

All my art and writing is about strong women who are ahead of their time, yet this seems to be absolutely lost on my female peers. Not that I&#039;m whining, per say. It&#039;s wonderful that so many men are moved by Frances Glessner Lee&#039;s story and want the world to know about her. 

Thank you, again, Sarah.]]></description>
