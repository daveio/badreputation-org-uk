					<description><![CDATA[Hate EA so much... so much... Apparently Origin is a &#039;feature&#039; for our benefit. Or something.

Anyway, great post! Cleared up a few questions I had (and I&#039;m VERY glad to see they got it right from the feminist angle). Good to hear it runs well on not-new machines too! 

But I&#039;m not buying ME3 until they make a happyhappy heroic ending. 

Because despite the gloom and &#039;we must make hard decisions&#039; of the earlier games, there was plenty which suggested Shepard DID have it in them to save the day. And I play games to be a superhero, so I want my 100% success &#039;grow old a hero with your romance partner and every single npc alive&#039; happy ending, dammit. 

And if I can&#039;t have it, I&#039;ll... not buy the 3rd game, and invent my own ending from 2. I just don&#039;t want the fighting bits badly enough to buy it and have the epic story end that way. Which is... the first time that&#039;s ever happened. I guess that&#039;s a testament to the writing and cinematography of 1+2, but it means I&#039;d genuinely rather wait for fan-made content than accept the official ending.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Another trivial before-I&#039;ve-finished-reading nitpick - if Wrex is still alive, his interactions with Eve are much more equal. They throw words back and forth, but he never questions her autonomy. Which I like, because Wrex is meant to be a true hope for a krogan future and Wreav is meant to be a &lt;em&gt;complete douchebag&lt;/em&gt;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A second trivial nitpick: I believe the ending DLC (at least) is supposed to be free, so EA making money out of it isn&#039;t necessarily the primary driver.  Retaining consumer goodwill might well be though.

On a more general note, perhaps the reactions to ME3 and Dragon Age 2 will persuade EA that they need to allow Bioware more time to actually finish their games.  Or perhaps not.  These large faceless corporations rarely behave in ways that make even a droplet of sense.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Totally trivial nitpick, something I&#039;m sure you&#039;re aware of, but other readers may not be: it *is* possible for Shepard to live, it&#039;s just bloody difficult, unless you play the online multiplayer.  (In which case a few hours play of that should render it a reasonably easy task.)

Personally, what bugs me about the ending isn&#039;t the events, it&#039;s that your choices have a negligible-to-the-point-of-being-laughable effect on what you actually see happening, despite the fact that the events in each of your three choices could easily play out quite differently.]]></description>
