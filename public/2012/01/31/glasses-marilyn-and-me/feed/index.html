					<description><![CDATA[odd.  i never thought that glasses made me &#039;less than sexy&#039; (although a lot of other things did).  wore them as a method of screening out idiots in the meet-market all my life.

it didn&#039;t necessarily always work.  that&#039;s probably because they didn&#039;t make ME any smarter about whomever it was i was currently infatuated with.

another thing about marilyn--she has more &#039;candid&#039; photos of her reading than almost any other thing.  either she spent a lot of time doing it, or wanted people to think that she did.  either way, such a smart girl.  too bad she&#039;s gone!]]></description>

Definitely not incompatible - I think those three things apply to a whole bunch of the team at BR Towers :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m short-sighted, a huge MM fan, and a feminist (these things are not incompatible). I hadn&#039;t really thought about the (mostly satirical) implications of glasses-wearing in her movies. Thanks for this!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think glasses look good on most men but not most women. Must be a face shape thing.
I do love a man in glasses. 
Anyway I have just had laser eye surgery so no more glasses for me till my mid-40s! :-). They were annoying when doing active things (although good protection when chopping onions) and I was always paranoid about losing/breaking them, however, there is something about being short-sighted I will miss, summed up by the ever-delightful Wendy Cope:

Haiku: Looking Out of the Back Bedroom Window Without My Glasses

What&#039;s that amazing
new lemon-yellow flower?
Oh yes, a football.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I used to hate my glasses, and went till I was about 20 without wearing them when I was supposed to (even at university, which meant I couldn&#039;t see what was going on half the time... urgh.)

And then I got a pair of glasses I loved, and now... I think I look hideous without them! Which may also not be sensible. But yeah. My glasses are kind of a part of my face now.]]></description>
