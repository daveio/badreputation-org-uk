					<description><![CDATA[The Batwoman print with her in the snow is sooo cool!

I wish SFX&#039;s imaginarium promo vid (last year&#039;s is on YouTube) didn&#039;t make it look like all the women involved are exotic dancers, none of whom get speech snippets (some of the dudes in costume do) and many of whom
are presented exclusively as Ironettes or steampunk poledancers with no other sense that they&#039;re involved except decoratively, but I&#039;m not at all surprised that&#039;s how the promo is for that particular feature, and it&#039;s not as if they&#039;re unique in going there. Hope you have a brill time!]]></description>
