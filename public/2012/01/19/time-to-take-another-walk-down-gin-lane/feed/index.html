					<description><![CDATA[Gin is enjoying widespread appeal and enjoying it isn&#039;t about testosterone-fuelled machismo, but about elegant sophistication. Gordon&#039;s just cottoned-on to that and changed their marketing campaign to reflect their target demographic.

I do wonder how much of the misfortune of Gordon&#039;s is down to Ramsay and how much is down to the plethora of new (and better) gins hitting the market.]]></description>
