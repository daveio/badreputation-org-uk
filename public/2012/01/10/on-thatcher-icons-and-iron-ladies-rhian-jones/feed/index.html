Thanks - I look forward to watching it. The casting of Jim Broadbent as Denis seems particularly inspired, and I&#039;m also keen to see how Olivia Colman plays her daughter Carol.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have seen the film. I thought it was good and quite balanced. She&#039;s a figure of great admiration and also great hatred and they show both. They also show her going a bit mental towards the end (well you&#039;d have to be to think the poll tax would go down well with anyone or their dog). The flashbacks of her in the 40s as a young woman getting stuck into a career full of patronising men are particularly good (can&#039;t remember the actress playing the young MT but she&#039;s fab) and totally inspiring. It&#039;s also a touching love story with her husband and a sensitive look at senile dementia. 

You know... just in case someone actually wanted to know what the film was about...]]></description>

&quot;even when her time in power hurt the *perception* of women in politics for generations.&quot;

Thanks, this is a key point which I didn&#039;t really bring out: Thatcher as the default mode for a Woman In Politics, because she was the most visible example.]]></description>

(The film has an age guidance rating; it&#039;s been given 12A, which makes it unsuitable for miners.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been out of the country, I came into Heathrow and casually looked to my left, to be confronted by a six-foot version of the Thatcher movie poster. I actually did a comedy double-take jump in the air, making warding signs and shouting OH DEAR GOD etc. They should warn us before putting that stuff out there. Age-guidance ratings for movie posters?

And everywhere the idea that a woman in power must be an icon for feminism, even when her policies hurt women, even when her time in power hurt the *perception* of women in politics for generations.]]></description>
