					<description><![CDATA[This is so great in so many ways, except for the crap responses.  I&#039;m so happy to hear about squads of happy huggy girls though, it makes me less cranky about the rest.  I feel like the ones after me will be ok. ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m so, so sorry to hear this. You didn&#039;t deserve that. You deserved more hugs.

Here&#039;s an e-hug, for what it&#039;s worth. You certainly deserve it. [you AND Babylon!]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What a fun, smart, clever post - about an interesting and novel experience. As a 33y/o female professional, I&#039;m pretty sick of feminism being explored angrily or from the point of view of victimhood, I&#039;m ready for it to be a more relaxed, fun topic where jokes and relative experiences are introduced alongside anecdotes and ideologies. I loved this article and found it approachable and well written. Nice job!]]></description>
