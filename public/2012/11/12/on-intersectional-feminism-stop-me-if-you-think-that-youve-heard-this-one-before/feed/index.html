					<description><![CDATA[Thanks Rhian, v well said!

I was talking to someone who works in a community theatre environment just last week, and we were discussing the various government and charity initiatives that encourage young people (at whatever level) to get into arts-based jobs.  I argued that it&#039;s massively disingenuous to suggest hard work and one little boost through a sponsored post (even if it&#039;s a year long) can solve the distinct lack of disparate voices in those roles.  As you point out, those unpaid internships are of no material value to those whose parents can&#039;t afford to support them for the years required to establish themselves in these fields.

I&#039;d love for you to expound on what you think is a less harmful tactic, under the circumstances.  Though I welcome diverse faces and voices in these arenas, I&#039;m deeply uncomfortable at the individual cost of giving false hope.]]></description>
