					<description><![CDATA[My first reaction reading this post, I&#039;m slightly afraid to say, wasn&#039;t about pirates, but WAS about awesome women with eyepatches - specifically, the Formula 1 test driver Maria de Villota, who was involved in a terrifying testing accident in July where she basically took the brunt of a collision with a truck... on her face.

After being rushed to hospital for some pretty drastic surgery, she has lost her right eye, and her sense of taste and smell, but still wants to return to racing if she can get a licence, and wants to get involved in the (somewhat beneath-the-radar but HUGELY important) motorsport safety movement.
