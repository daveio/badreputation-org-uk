I know what you mean, but I always find the term &quot;strong woman&quot; really telling. No one ever says &quot;he&#039;s a strong man&quot;. It&#039;s as if &quot;strong&quot;, when applied to &quot;woman&quot; actually denotes &quot;in spite of being a&quot;. 

&quot;She&#039;s a strong woman&quot; really just means &quot;she&#039;s a character who asserts herself&quot;. I don&#039;t see why Hollywood has to make a big &quot;look at me doing this EVEN THOUGH SEXISM, and even though I&#039;m a WOMAN!&quot; out of it. And the &quot;bitch&quot; line does do that, I think.]]></description>

I don&#8217;t see why Hollywood has to make a big &#8220;look at me doing this EVEN THOUGH SEXISM, and even though I&#8217;m a WOMAN!&#8221; out of it. And the &#8220;bitch&#8221; line does do that, I think.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I actually liked the &quot;dumb b*tch&quot; line.  She&#039;s a strong woman, and that seems to be the default insult for someone like that.  I could definitely see lots of (recently less rich) people calling her a b*tch, so I just don&#039;t think she cares.  She&#039;s used to it.  Cost of not being a wimp.

Plus it was kinda funny.]]></description>

The new film is, I think, the first one in the franchise to pass Bechdel.  Speaking as someone who loves Batman despite the concept&#039;s problems, that speaks volumes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[To be honest, I haven&#039;t been following the Batman films.  The last one I saw was &quot;Batman and Robin&quot;, starring Alicia Silverstone, Uma Thurman and some men.  Nor do I play computer games.  So I&#039;m not well placed to comment on this.  But I followed one of the links from this post, and saw that Anne Hathaway is placed fifth in the cast list, after four men.  I suppose that says something about the status of women as far as this film franchise is concerned.]]></description>
