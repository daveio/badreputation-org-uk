					<description><![CDATA[Biker culture is ... interesting, and significantly varied.  The type of chauvinism I&#039;ve encountered in my local community is different from what I run into in normal culture.  For one thing, it is easier to opt out as a woman, and even women who don&#039;t opt out seem to me to be treated as individuals, if that makes sense.  They may be likely to be defined by their relationship to men, but that doesn&#039;t mean they aren&#039;t expected to ride, to know about bikes and be interesting people with things to say.  Bikers have conversations with women they aren&#039;t sleeping with and don&#039;t intend to sleep with (I spent time around tech; this is not a given.)  Even the on-a-pedestal-women are admired for participating in some, but not all, of the toughness culture.
They are also admired for being sexually available and attractive, but I&#039;ve encountered less double-bind culture there and it&#039;s an older hobby; it&#039;s not the case that women leave when they get past 30.  There is a good chunk of hard-core objectification around, especially in marketing, but often it is objectifying women who aren&#039;t in the culture.  There are sort of four options: bikers (who can be men or women), passengers (who are almost all women), non-bikers (men and women and kids, whatever) and sexy women (who bring beer and are used to sell stuff to bikers).

I think much of this is because it is an opt-in subculture.  Women who enjoy going to events are there because they want to be, just like the men (married men often ride alone if their wives don&#039;t want to participate.)  It&#039;s decidedly a working-middle-class hobby (being able to afford a second vehicle to drive around just for fun is a luxury, but it&#039;s not an urban or uber-rich hobby), and that means it tends to be a more sufficiency-culture.  There are lots of charity events (which I associate with rich people, generally) and people toss in more than needed to cover those who might be tight.  Where I live it involves a lot of middle-class people who grew up poorer or more rural than where they are now, and it is a way to hang on to a more community-centric culture that doesn&#039;t look down on you for where you came from.

At least, that&#039;s certainly why I participate.]]></description>
