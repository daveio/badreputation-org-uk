@Jen: Hi! Galatea of Lashings here -- thanks so much for the link, glad you enjoyed the post :)

@Hodge: Seriously excellent post! There are a lot of films here that I hadn&#039;t even considered -- this definitely seems to be pointing to a mile-wide streak of queerphobia running right through Disney kids&#039; films.]]></description>

That&#039;s interesting - the foreign thing in particular, as there&#039;s an interesting history of Disney&#039;s voice artists: in Dumbo the horribly racist crows (one of whom is actually CALLED Jim Crow) are voiced by white actors doing their best &#039;black person&#039; impression. By the time you get to The Jungle Book, they wanted Louis Armstrong to be King Louis (which is why he&#039;s called King Louis), but Armstrong wouldn&#039;t do it (presumably because he had understandable issues about voicing a monkey singing about how he wants to be &#039;like you&#039;). So they got a less famous jazz singer to voice him. Then in the Lion King it&#039;s Whoopi Goldberg voicing one of the hyenas - who are so obviously New York ghetto hoodlums (I think one of the others is Hispanic - it&#039;s a sort of &#039;generically foreign&#039; underworld). Something very disturbing there about how the ideologies become ingrained in what Disney are doing to an extent that they&#039;re almost robbed of any power to shock and they actually manage to get people like Goldberg implicitly on side where they couldn&#039;t get Armstrong (and I assume they wouldn&#039;t even have ALLOWED any non-white actor to voice the crows at that point, even had they wanted to). 

Dunno, it&#039;s not something I really want to comment on too much because I don&#039;t think it&#039;s really my place to do so, but there&#039;s definitely something rather disturbing going on there.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good piece. Just a quick note - 

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is therefore in keeping that her methodology basically amounts to ‘hair down = female; hair up = male’ – and no-one ever notices it’s all the same person, just with a different hairstyle&lt;/blockquote&gt;

- this is actually a common trope in classic Chinese kung-fu flicks, rather than a Disney invention.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well, I have always found the Disney villains more interesting than the heroes, so... ;) But honestly, the more I read academical (read: intelligent) articles and analyses on Disney cartoons, the harder I find it to genuinely like them.

&#039;English with an Accent: Language, Ideology and Discrimination in the United States&#039; by Rosina Lippi-Green has a whole chapter on how Disney&#039;s feature films teach children to discriminate based on accents that deviate from the norm. It&#039;s well worth a read if you are interested in sociolinguistics. (Unsurprisingly, most villains sound either a) foreign, or b) uneducated, whereas all heroes have a perfect standard accent, mostly of the US variety, and the use of AAVE in characters is horribly stereotypical.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love Ursula and her sumptuous lasciviousness (Marina Warner calls it her &quot;black velvet madam&quot; look!) but I definitely agree we&#039;re meant to see it as terrible in relation to Ariel. I can&#039;t believe Disney have slimmed her down for their villains fashion design range - as though her shape isn&#039;t a deliberate part of her design (and, I think, intended as an indicator of her excessive villainy- I try to ignore this when I watch the film)?!

Still love her though. She has the BEST song.]]></description>
