					<description><![CDATA[Always - ive used them for years the green packet. Highly absorbant and worked a treat. Then they introduced actipearls - I never realised until I kept getting cystitis during period which never happened before i then noticed the awful lemon scent.

I went to shops and every place I searched back street chemists shops supermarkets all actipearls.  I phoned Always and they suggested Always Silk pads are unscented.

I bought a pack and ha-presto they stank of mint...... is that not scented?????

I was a loyal Always customer for years, boots, sainsburys, tesco NOW ALL scented  then i discovered Halo yes absorbant and unscented - I bought every packet off the shelf because they were also cheap.

Then tesco stopped doing them - they only sell halo tampons now.

Tampons - all scented too

Bodyform, Always, Lillets, Tesco,  Sainsbury, Boots all pads abd tampons scented.......why?

Are they trying to say we stink? If you change pad often it wont stink

Every gynecologist will confirm scented products no good for the private area as it causes theush cystitis and allergic reactions.

Why do Always change their WHOLE range to be scented? Why not have scented and unscented versions of all ranges give us women a choice?

We should all phone slways and complain?

Or just Mooncup from now on?]]></description>

Great article, so true. I&#039;ve stopped using them - they were giving me thrush. After contacting always and getting a generic copy and pasted  email back , something about &#039;our products are all carefully tested&#039; etc and &#039;we can&#039;t always predict individual reactions&#039; , I just decided they&#039;re actually really incompetent morons who don&#039;t follow common sense advice from medical professionals/GP&#039;s as any decent doctor will tell you to stay away from perfumed products in genital areas. Switched to li-lets now and so much happier, no more horrible burning/itching after day 3 of using the things.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Now ALL sanitary pads are scented even Tesco brand :( I did buy Halo but now they have been removed from Tesco shelves. Bodyform every brand is scented. Scented causes thrush and cystitis and stinks. Do we customers have any say at all in what we want to buy. I want to buy unscented HELP perhaps I will use mooncup now]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Completely agree! Totally offensive - both their assumptions and the foul &#039;perfume&#039; itself. I too have stopped using Always and won&#039;t go back

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2012/07/03/actipearls-and-having-a-happy-period/#comment-15704&quot;&gt;Annemieke&lt;/a&gt;.

I also stopped using Always since they started with that horrible smelly stuff. It just made me itch and burn down there, instantly! I&#039;m actually surprised that a product that is so bad for women&#039;s health is allowed to be sold. I e-mailed the Always customer support a while back, with a very angry mail saying thanks for the message they send that women have stinking c**ts, and I won&#039;t ever be using their products again. Weeks later I just got a marketing reply with bla bla, and no reply at all to the contents of my mail. 

Actually I feel like contacting a member of (in my case Dutch) parliament to ask questions about this. A product like this should be prohibited, because it&#039;s bad for vaginal health. First thing a doctor will ask when you have a yeast infection is weather you use scented pads / toilet paper / soap or stuff like laktacyd (or whatever it&#039;s alled) down there. They will advise you to STOP using that stuff straight away! Really, they should be prohibited. It really angers me!

Conclusion: GREAT ARTICLE! :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m in the middle of an asthma attack prompted by this perfume ambush. Angry doesn&#039;t begin to describe it.
I&#039;ve also just discovered that the unperfumed product by a rival manufacturer has in fact picked up some of the scent from just being on the shelf next to the offending items.

Bloody marvellous.]]></description>
