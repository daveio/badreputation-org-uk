					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2012/07/27/guest-post-the-seven-traits-of-highly-unsuccessful-people-or-troubled-families-a-moral-maze/#comment-3874&quot;&gt;Cluisanna&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi, Cluisanna,

You&#039;re right, it&#039;s teenage conception (so being pregnant or having an abortion) that&#039;s listed as being considered problematic. Luckily, the abstainence lobby hasn&#039;t taken off in the UK.

As I said in the article, teenagers being pregnant or ending a pregnancy shouldn&#039;t be considered in itself an indicator of trouble, but if there are problems with criminality or missing school (presumably the teenage parents, too!) then it&#039;s fair to say there&#039;s a clearer need to engage with the family, even if it&#039;s to have a serious talk about safer sex!

					<description><![CDATA[Wait, using contraception under 18 is a long-term health problem? Seriously??? This is from the UK, right? I don&#039;t know about you, but in Germany most people have sex at around 15 or sixteen, and of course they are using contraception (it&#039;s taught in schools). Isn&#039;t it actually the other way around, that people who *don&#039;t* use contraception so early tend to form &quot;troubled&quot; families? (And why the hell health problem?)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post, informative and tackled the entire subject with an understanding of the nuances of this complex subject. It feels as though, more and more, current policy is moving towards a (heteronormative) view that &#039;wife+husband+children+home = good&#039; and anything else is ultimately, a crime. Hopefully articles that tear this down (like this one) will help people fight against that view.

					<description><![CDATA[That first list of criteria (which Eric Pickles said the families should be &#039;stigmatised more&#039; for, because it&#039;s their fault) translates as:

Being Poor, Being Unemployed, Bad Housing, Not educated, Suffering from mental illness, Having any long-term illness, and Being Poor.

(If you ARE working but in bad housing, or you are long-term physically or mentally ill, you are described as &#039;lazy&#039;.)

I didn&#039;t know about the second more subtle considerations list, that&#039;s really interesting, because it wasn&#039;t the families who allow crime or truancy, or anti-social behaviour, that Pickles singled out for stigmatising. He *literally* defined problem families on public record as &quot;The Poor&quot; and &quot;The Sick&quot;. Unbelievable.

Thank you so much for this post, it&#039;s good to know that the initial intentions were at least more nuanced, and it&#039;s people at Pickles&#039; level who turned it into such a disgusting mess!]]></description>
