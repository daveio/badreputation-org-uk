					<description><![CDATA[I have all of those games, so you can leave me off the survey, but my Steam ID is wererogue for any badrep readers who want to add me.  Actually, better idea: could we do a badrep Steam group?

I also wanted to expand on a couple of things in the post.  Firstly on Greenlight, I think it&#039;s critical to talk a little about how independent developers don&#039;t have publishers telling them how to modify their game to appeal to &quot;gamers&quot;, so you see a lot more gender-friendly titles made by indies.  It cuts both ways, too - indies are free to let their prejudices run wild.  Greenlight is interesting because it gives the community a voice in what gets sold on Steam, which means that conversations which educate the masses have a real, solid impact on actual games being made.

Secondly, TF2, since it kind of came up twice here - once that you played it, and once for Meet The Pyro.  TF2 could have a post all by itself, but my summary is that it&#039;s *spectacularly* awful for gender representation, with the devs flat-out refusing to consider even some female playable characters.  I was almost willing to brush that off when they started branding everything in the game with &quot;Mann&quot;, which given the timing I can only assume was them trying to poke fun at themselves, but really feels much more like a Yorkie Bar (&quot;It&#039;s not for girls&quot;).  Which is a shame because the game is so damned good that people of all gender rock TF2, hard.]]></description>
