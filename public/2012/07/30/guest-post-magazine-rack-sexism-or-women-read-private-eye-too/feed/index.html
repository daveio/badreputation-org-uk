					<description><![CDATA[The only thing I can think of for &quot;grammar issues&quot; is if they misunderstood what you were saying about papers having a &quot;femail&quot; section?  Even then, that&#039;s a spelling issue.

Also!  Congratulations Lizzie and congrats to Sainsburys for not being bigoted dinosaurs!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This problem exists in other places too. I was looking for a gift for a friend&#039;s birthday and was confronted on most websites with &quot;gifts for him/gifts for her&quot;. 

The gifts for him include things like games consoles, cameras, trainers and action-adventure films while gifts for her suggest romantic comedies, clutch handbags, hair appliances, jewellery and bake ware. 

I own most of these things (no clutch handbags for me), and I think most women do too so I don&#039;t really understand why websites feel the need to separate them by gender.  

By the way, I think that Sainsburys think you are questioning the apostrophe in &quot;Men&#039;s health&quot;]]></description>
