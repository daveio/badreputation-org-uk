					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2012/07/05/gamer-diary-from-indie-camaraderie-to-get-back-in-the-kitchen-slut-the-ups-and-downs-of-the-internet-gaming-verse/#comment-2821&quot;&gt;Stephen B&lt;/a&gt;.

I knew it was contravening the ECHR as I had to study that in my time at uni for other reasons of discrimination but wasn&#039;t sure about the First Amendment.  I&#039;m not a lawyer or a legal-type but even a very basic reading of the exclusions seems to (at the very least) bring into question the plausibility of using it to get away with this sort of abuse.

Also, I agree, Bastion has been awesome - so far - I haven&#039;t finished it yet but I don&#039;t expect it to let me down.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s really interesting about the first amendment exceptions, cos I&#039;ve heard that used as an excuse on particularly vile politics forums for years. The threats and intentional distress are broken several times a minute in some cases.

And that bundle is amazing - Bastion is worth it on its own!]]></description>
