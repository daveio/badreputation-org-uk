					<description><![CDATA[Unfortunately, there&#039;s a bit of a fly in the otherwise wonderful Brave ointment.

Brenda Chapman, the originator of the story, one of the writers and the sole director, was fired off the project by Disney in 2010:

http://articles.latimes.com/2011/may/25/entertainment/la-et-women-animation-sidebar-20110525

It&#039;s now being directed by Mark Andrews.

Maybe it happened because of &#039;creative differences&#039; but the timing of it was very odd.]]></description>

I&#039;ll anthropomorphise you in a minute...

Yes, of course I am excited for Brave. :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2012/02/27/being-brave/#comment-2190&quot;&gt;Russell&lt;/a&gt;.

I think anything can be anthropomorphised - look at the furniture in Beauty and the Beast. Or more generally the rhetorical device of apostrophe (&quot;O, moon!&quot;, etc) has a lot of it going on. It&#039;s a thing humans do, and I think how they gender when they do it is of particular interest (see also: alphabet S for ship post) :)

But anyway, back to the point: are you excited for Brave? Braaaaave!]]></description>

I think possibly horses as a race are rather single-minded, and it may do them a disservice to anthropomorphise their characteristics in such a manner. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2012/02/27/being-brave/#comment-2188&quot;&gt;Russell&lt;/a&gt;.

Interesting. 

I like Maximus as he&#039;s a good compliment to Flynn who is a subversion of a bunch of prince/masculinity tropes (&quot;this is the story of how I died&quot;)  but I don&#039;t think his determination is especially male or masculine! 

AGRIPPINA LIVES ON IN MY MIND &lt;3

ps. Don&#039;t forget Dick Turpin had Black Bess and she was a pretty determined hoss ;)

pps. there is even a poem http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Black_Bess :D]]></description>
