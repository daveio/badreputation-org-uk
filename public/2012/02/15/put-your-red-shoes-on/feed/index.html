Hey Karyn! I am so pleased you commented! I am blown away by the enthusiasm and wonderful design of the Red Pump Project and would love to interview you about the project and the issues it raises if you have the time... then we could do another post on it. Alternatively if you fancy writing a quick article for us you would be very welcome.

In the meantime, I will totally share a photo! I own several pairs of red shoes including a rather ill-advised 5&quot; glittery pair so I&#039;ll tweet you when the post is up :) I will also ask some of the team if they can spare a pic or two in solidarity. 

WomanKind Worldwide (http://www.womankind.org.uk/) have also tweeted the link and were pleased to learn about the project - I definitely share their hopes that it could expand!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Miranda - This is awesome! Thank you so much for the love all the way in the UK. I couldn&#039;t agree more with the points that you&#039;re making. One of the main goals of our nonprofit and the campaign is to promote open dialogue, to fight the stigma around the disease, and to share knowledge around the issues so that women are EMPOWERED to advocate for their health and the health of the women in their lives.

We REALLY appreciate this blog post and your support. Thank you, thank you, thank you! We hope that on March 10 you&#039;ll share a photo of yourself rocking your red pumps (or flats).

Co-Founder, The Red Pump Project]]></description>
