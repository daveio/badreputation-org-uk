					<description><![CDATA[Cheek by Jowl are AMAZING. Also, as a theatre producer and sometime theatre maker I am so glad that there are people out there who actually watch shows. get involved and get carried along by it rather than sitting in their seats, sedately and going &quot;hmmmm&quot;

Woo!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great review. I love this play and have been wanting to see this for a while and now even more so! Just wanted to say about the presentation of Soranzo, while I agree it sounds awkward from one perspective, from another it also sounds like a really well observed version of the cyclical dynamics of many real abusive relationships. Also, maybe they needed that in there to make it believable that this stronger Annabella would stay?

Btw, did you know Angela Carter rewrote &#039;Tis Pity as a Western style short story? It&#039;s brilliant but most &#039;Tis Pity scholars I know haven&#039;t heard of it so I always pimp it when I get the chance!]]></description>
