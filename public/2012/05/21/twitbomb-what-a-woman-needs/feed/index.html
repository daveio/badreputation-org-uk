Yes! Not just Bonney and Read, either.  :) 

I wrote this a while ago: http://www.badreputation.org.uk/2011/01/20/five-pirate-women-from-the-pages-of-history-number-one-lady-killigrew/

Need to actually do parts 2 to 5, shame on me!

They were rarer than men, but definitely a presence. All around the world, too - some are ancient world, though, and even with the more modern ones the accounts are, I think, either sketchier than for the boys or often even more sensationalised. 

So it&#039;s hard to get at the truth. However, for a toy designer I hold the legends to be a rich seam enough. Lady pirates! More of them on things I can buy! YES :)]]></description>

Hey, wow, that&#039;s actually kind of brilliant! Like you, I am trying to picture the design process/discussion for this particular outcome and failing somewhat (is this like the next best option than an undisguised female pirate, for example?) but I&#039;m mainly just, like, telling myself it&#039;s because the lead designer at Little Tikes wishes to convey a subtle yet pointed message about GENDER AS PERFORMANCE :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[To soothe some of your kids pirate lady needs, have a look at the pirate scooter my son&#039;s aunt bought for him:

http://www.littletikes.com/kids-toys/play-scoot-pirate-ship

Oh no, I&#039;ve made a mistake.  There is clearly only a Captain and a first mate here.

Hey wait... take a closer look at that Captain...

http://zoomcc.richfx.com.edgesuite.net/zoomcc_littletikes/Image/Media/622113-figures_300.jpg

Ah, yes, there&#039;s something fishy going on here.  He&#039;s got a fake peg leg!  That&#039;s his shoe you can see poking out from behind - he&#039;s wearing a peg on his knee.

Hey wait...

He&#039;s wearing a fake beard.

And he has long ginger hair and green eyes.

He is a SECRET LADY PIRATE.  Or a secret beardless pirate, but I strongly suspect the former.

I have so many concerns, and so many questions, but they are all quelled by the idea that my son&#039;s pirate captain is a secret lady.  It is the best.  She can trade lady pirate stories with his goblin First Mate, Lula (also provided by his aunt :V ).]]></description>

I can&#039;t believe we left that off. 

We are now honour bound to raise this the next time we are moved to mount a TwitBomb.
