					<description><![CDATA[Re: Emily, I&#039;m a straight guy (from Pakistan :P) and I respect you and admire your courage. Respect yourself, as you fully deserve to, entirely and wholeheartedly, and ultimately you&#039;ll see past (and perhaps even forgive) the small heartedness and fear that causes others to wrong themselves by treating you with disrespect.

Hope your doing well two years on :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am a transsexual Male to Female. My shame voice for years berated me because I wasn&#039;t living up to the male role expectations. Finally, I am free to a great extent of that shame 2 1/2 years into my transition. But, now I am starting to see the effects of female shame in my life. I have an eating disorder I am working on and if I stand up for what I believe in and value, my shame voice calls me a drama queen, because women are to be seen and not heard. However having been raised male I have a strong sense of my human birthright to be treated with respect, since it is so important in the male world to respect other men. This causes a lot of problems when I interact with the world having this expectation for how I should be treated. Mostly with men who don&#039;t want to respect me.]]></description>
