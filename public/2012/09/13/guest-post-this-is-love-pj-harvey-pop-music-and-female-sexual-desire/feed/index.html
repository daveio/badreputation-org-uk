					<description><![CDATA[Great post and fascinating topic. I warmed to PJ Harvey partly *because* of her healthy attitude to sex and the fact she bothered to write a song taking a pop at sexual shame and misogyny (Sheela-Na-Gig lyrics here in case anyone doesn&#039;t know them http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/40525/) 

There&#039;s also a tradition of overtly sexual lyrics from female subject blues songs, in particular by Bessie Smith. Have a look at &#039;I&#039;m Wild About That Thing&#039; (video here http://youtu.be/-cm5Adn9YCs) but also &#039;Kitchen Man&#039; and &#039;I Need A Little Sugar In My Bowl&#039;. I remember reading an argument somewhere that these songs have only become well known relatively recently because they tended not to get added to compilations and collections of Smith&#039;s work because they were deemed to be embarrassingly raunchy and didn&#039;t fit with the tragic persona demanded of many women blues singers and epitomised by Billie Holiday.]]></description>
