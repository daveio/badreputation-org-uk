					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s a long time since I considered Jessica Rabbit, but this post has set me thinking.  I imagine that several men had some input into the design of the character.   It&#039;s as though they compiled a list of desirable female attributes (huge breasts, tiny waist, etc.) and then put them all into the same drawing.  The image kind of works, I think, because the drawing is in a recognisable cartoon style in which we don&#039;t expect realism.  (If it comes to that, Roger Rabbit doesn&#039;t look much like any real rabbit I&#039;ve ever seen.)

But what, I wonder, if a real woman set out to make herself look as much like Jessica Rabbit as is humanly possible.  It would, I suppose, require surgery -- and lead to severe health problems (her digestive system, for a start).  But would the men who designed Jessica Rabbit find the real life equivalent attractive?  I strongly suspect not.  Well, at least, I hope not.

Does anyone here remember the late Lolo Ferrari?

All that surgery to turn herself into something that seemed to me monstrous.

I don&#039;t know exactly where these thoughts lead me, but there seems something disturbing at work.

I also wonder how the drawing would look if a group of heterosexual women set out to create a male equivalent of Jessica Rabbit.]]></description>
