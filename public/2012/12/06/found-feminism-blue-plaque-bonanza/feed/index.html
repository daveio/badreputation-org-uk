					<description><![CDATA[Hello,
Great article, thank you.  I didn&#039;t know about Barbara Bodoichon before now, another inspirational Hastings woman.  I do know a bit about Muriel Matters though and I know that no. 7 Pelham Crescent wasn&#039;t a nursing home.  Muriel did live in a nursing home at the end of her life, it was St Anthony’s care home on West Hill Road, St Leonards.  She died on the 17th of November 1969.]]></description>
