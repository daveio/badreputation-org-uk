					<description><![CDATA[Ruth:

A couple clarifications for you: the Treehouse set was in the initial grouping of sets, along with Cafe, Beauty Shop, Inventor&#039;s Workshop, Vet clinic, House, etc.  Also, the second wave of sets, such as Flying Club (which you feature) was already designed and in production before the petition -- so your attribution is mis-placed!  It was even debuted at the February 2012 (yes, twenty-twelve) New York Toy Fair; those images were already online before the petition with false information received its help by the mailing.
That you mention your &quot;scope&quot; of this theme was narrowed by &quot;your&quot; Internet &#039;world&#039; is typical of people who could not see its benefits of getting more girls interested in building with bricks.  You were being blinded by the hyped rage.  Organization which continually &quot;only&quot; showed images of certain sets they felt were stereotyping failed to be objective and include the whole range.  Now that you see them, even you are realizing the benefits.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2012/12/11/guest-post-lego-friends-revisited/#comment-15984&quot;&gt;tricialo&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks for the link. I found the site interesting to read. I actually think they make some good points about what is right with Lego friends, but I don&#039;t like the way they make the points. 

And as a little edition to my article - they now have a karate set and a magician. They definitely are improving!]]></description>
