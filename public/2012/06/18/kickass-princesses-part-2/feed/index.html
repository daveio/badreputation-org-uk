					<description><![CDATA[Ooooh, Cornelia Funke, she&#039;s awesome! I don&#039;t know how many of her books were translated into English, though, I read them in the original German - lots of stories about girls on adventures. She has another book about a Princess called &quot;Igraine the Brave&quot; which I loved.
Oh, and speaking of awesome princesses, don&#039;t forget the &quot;Enchanted Forest Chronicles&quot; by Patricia C. Wrede! I looooved those as a child and do so still. They are about a princess who doesn&#039;t like being a princess and thus looks for a dragon that will &quot;abduct&quot; her. She befriends  a dragon and lives with her, telling princes who want to rescue her to go away. :D That&#039;s only the beginning of the story, of course.]]></description>
