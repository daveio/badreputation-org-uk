					<description><![CDATA[Interested to see what the 20 rules for detective fiction were, I checked this link: http://gaslight.mtroyal.ca/vandine.htm

I see that, throughout, it uses the male pronoun for both the detective and the reader.  Surely, even in 1928, women must have read detective stories, even if they weren&#039;t yet permitted to detect.  In fact, it only once alludes to a woman:

&quot;A really fascinating crime is one committed by a pillar of a church, or a spinster noted for her charities.&quot;

Hmph!]]></description>
