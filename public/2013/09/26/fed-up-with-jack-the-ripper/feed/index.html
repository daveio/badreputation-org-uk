					<description><![CDATA[Great piece.  In another life I was a teacher for 10 years teaching secondary history. I did a Ripper project with my year 8s but a significant part of our study was to look at the biographies of the women and look at their lives in the context of Victorian London. We considered why they were vulnerable and why Jack might have chosen them. The students often ended up more fascinated by the women than Jack.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2013/09/26/fed-up-with-jack-the-ripper/#comment-78001&quot;&gt;Sarah&lt;/a&gt;.

I watched and enjoyed the Lucy Worsley programme.  The focus was on the development of the public&#039;s ghoulish interest in murder, which seems to me an interesting topic.  I didn&#039;t notice any victim blaming, nor was the emphasis on violence against women.  The Red Barn murder was only case she covered in which a woman was specifically targeted.  (Another was of a whole family slaughtered: members of both sexes.)

What she said of a female murderer was interesting.  (I&#039;ve already forgotten lethal lady&#039;s name, though.)  She seemed the only interesting murderer.

As someone who used to work with the families of murder victims (for Victim Support), though, I never feel entirely easy with murder as entertainment.  My own experience suggests that the predominant emotion arising from murder is sadness.  That never seems properly reflected in murder as presented in the media.]]></description>

Gasp! I hadn&#039;t seen that - might try and watch it tonight. 

Have you read The Suspicions of Mr Whicher? I haven&#039;t yet but apparently fascinating.

And thank you :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post (just spent quite a long time reading up about the Ratcliff Highway murders too..). 

Have you seen this? http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p01ftzs2/A_Very_British_Murder_with_Lucy_Worsley_The_New_Taste_for_Blood/ 

I have pre-existing reservations about Lucy Worsley from a feminist perspective, so I am quite intrigued by this combination.]]></description>
