NSFW, but more in a &quot;naked people&quot; way than an &quot;enormous anime boobies&quot; way.

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2013/09/23/webcomics-to-watch-out-for-part-one/#comment-78106&quot;&gt;Miranda&lt;/a&gt;.

Well, not random, but I can grab you 3 interesting ones for sure:

1. Nimona
It hasn&#039;t been running long (maybe a year?) but I&#039;m totally in love with Nimona, a story about a shape-shifting runaway troublemaker who teams up with an evil mastermind, and in which nobody is quite what they seem.

2. Bad Machinery (Scary Go Round)
Bad Machinery is the continuation of Scary Go Round, a sort of British version of Eerie Indiana.  John Allison pays incredible detail to the believably of his characters, changing their outfits and hairstyles regularly but keeping them recognizable and imbuing them with deep personalities and personal details.  Add to that the mysteries of Tackleford, and a note-perfect expression of general British dialogue, diversity and all, and Scary Go Round will always hold a special place in my heart.

Bad Machinery is a relaunch of the comic, with the old 20-something characters a few years older and holding respectable positions, and the younger members of the SGR cast taking the lead.  It was a brave step and one that has paid off fantastically.

3. Sinfest
Word of warning: Sinfest seems to have started out as a message from the author Tatsuya Ishida: &quot;I love my vices, I&#039;m just a normal guy, leave me alone&quot; comic.  Despite that, there&#039;s still something a bit compelling about &quot;It-Girl&quot; Monique and &quot;Regular Guy&quot; Slick, and the occasional pet comic and poetry kept me reading long after I was fed up with the porn- and drug- worship and casual harassment wore very thin indeed.

And I&#039;m so, so glad I did.  Ishida had some sort of epiphany in 2011 (I remember this strip especially: http://www.sinfest.net/archive_page.php?comicID=4116) and started to explore some pretty fundamental feminist concepts, breaking down bit-by-bit the culture that he&#039;d endorsed so strongly before.  He neglected his other storylines for a while to bring in a new group, The Sisterhood - women who see the cracks in the illusion and are out to put things back in order.

Sinfest still isn&#039;t perfect - it does sometimes have weird, simplistic tones to the issues it&#039;s portraying.  But to see an author wrestle with and overturn such a fundamental belief in his work which revolved around that belief was priceless, and will keep me reading for a lot longer.

Other interesting mentions that I don&#039;t have time to break down:
Guilded Age
Lady Sabre and the Pirates of the Ineffable Ether
Girl Genius
Order Of The Stick
Hark! A Vagrant.
The Non-Adventures of Wonderella
Strangebeard
The Trenches - despite the Penny Arcade association.]]></description>
