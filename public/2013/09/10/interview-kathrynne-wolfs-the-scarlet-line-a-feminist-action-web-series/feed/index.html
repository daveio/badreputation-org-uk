					<description><![CDATA[I am deeply concerned about the narrow representation and the lack of interesting women leads in media as well as the interpretation of these women (&quot;strong, superhuman, etc...) and how it corresponds to reality. My biggest concern is the lack of progress. There are many examples of communities who were oppressed, various races or classes suffered discrimination which have completely overcome their oppression. The Irish, the Italians, Australians, some merchant classes, all experienced discrimination and oppression and were able to completely overcome the oppression in American culture and society. Women have not been able to do this for themselves. Why? I am alarmed that we are still struggling. I think the cause is the fundamental ingredient of the cure. Self-reflection on this point is not possible in a one dimensional &quot;strong female&quot; who does not justify her sense of integrity without a lineage, a history to give integrity to this character. Many of these leads are &quot;the first&quot; of her kind, the lone rebel. The character not only doesn&#039;t have a community that accepts nor appreciates her, her parents are a distant memory and not her teachers. She is often peerless and this in itself damages her integrity. It also fails to model a society of confident women. Our current position is reinforced by this &quot;strong female lead&quot; that goes it alone in a man&#039;s world and fails to document the change we wish to see. Feminism is more than a personal journey. It is the journey of more than half the world&#039;s population. It is absurd that we have not overcome all forms of discrimination in every corner of the planet.]]></description>
