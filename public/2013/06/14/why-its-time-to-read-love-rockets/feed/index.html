In spite of my puzzlement, I remained sufficiently interested to keep my two Love &#038; Rockets comics, although I sold some of the other comic books I once owned.

Amazon have now dispatched my two Love &#038; Rockets volumes, so I should soon be able to start reading the series from the beginning.  It&#039;s nice to know that one of the books on its way to me is probably your favourite.]]></description>

I&#039;m not surprised you were puzzled! It really is a series you have to read from the beginning to make any sense of I think. But it pays off as you watch the characters change (sometimes in quite surprising ways!) over such a long period. &#039;Girl from H.O.P.P.E.R.S&#039; is probably my favourite of all those collected volumes.]]></description>

That&#039;s great to hear, I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll enjoy them, the worlds they&#039;ve created are so incredibly rich. I only started reading L&#038;R a few years ago, had been put off for the same reasons. Was very grateful for that Fantagraphics guide!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Many years ago, I bought Love &#038; Rockets 6 (plus another related comic called Fritz &#038; Petra).  I was intrigued by them, liked what I saw, but was puzzled.  Issue 6, I suppose, wasn&#039;t a good place to begin... but the two I bought were all that the local comic shop had.  Reminded and convinced by this post, I&#039;ve now ordered from Amazon &quot;Maggie the Mechanic v. 1&quot; and &quot;Girl from H.O.P.P.E.R.S.&quot;.  This time, I hope to be less puzzled.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you so much for this! Love and Rockets has been in my cultural periphery for about 20 years but I&#039;ve always been overwhelmed with the amount of stuff out there and wasn&#039;t sure where best to dive in. Have just ordered the first volume and am excited about entering this new world. :)]]></description>
