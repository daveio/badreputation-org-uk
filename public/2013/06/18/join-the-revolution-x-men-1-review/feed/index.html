					<description><![CDATA[Unfortunately, due to some monstrously poor editorial decisions, Psylocke is basically stuck in permanent yellowface. She is British by birth but had her mind transferred into the body of an Asian woman. I remember Matt Fraction (who, to be fair, is normally not only a good comic book writer but one who is respectful of female and minority characters) actually described her as &quot;another non-white face&quot;, which is awful. I wish they&#039;d put her back and make Karma a full time member of some team.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Three non-white characters in the line-up, surely? Isn&#039;t Psylocke also a woman of color?

(Mind, this is the first X-book I have bought, and what I know of Psylocke&#039;s history bothers me, so I may be entirely wrong about this.)]]></description>
