					<description><![CDATA[Hello
In some measure, I share your critic about Val Jean. Too saintly, yes. But also remember that the musical was sort of a summary of a book of 1300 pages. In the book Val jean had some complex moments, not so saintly. For example, he does not &quot;converts&quot; inmediately after the bishop pardoned and gives him the silver. With the silver in his bag, he goes slowly out of town, he is confused, he does not know what to think, what to do. He sits in a stone in the fields. Then a boy, a young labourer, passes near him playing with a valuable coin. The coin falls near Valjean, he puts the feet over it and when the boy asks for his money, Valjean first acts like &quot;Dont know what are you talking about&quot; and then he shouts: &quot;get out of here NOW&quot;, grasping his stick. A moment after, he realized that he has been very nasty, specially because all this was AFTER he was saved and blessed by the bishop, and he runs by the fields looking for the boy, &quot;Petit Gervais!, Petit Gervais&quot;, but nobody answers. &quot;I am a wretched man!&quot;, he sobs. Of course the scene is 100 ways better than this briefing.
Regards,
Pedro.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My partner was huge fan of Les Mis when she was a teenager, so we had to see it. I think Jean Valjean&#039;s strange life choices only make sense in the context of Catholicism/Anti-Catholicism.  Victor Hugo started out Catholic and then became very anti-Catholic and the story seems to be wrangling with that.  As an ex-Catholic, the story felt pretty familiar to me - suffering, redemption etc.]]></description>

:D Yes, there&#039;s one, fairly objectified, working-class fan-maker (called, unpronounceably, Feuilly) among the students, but the rest of them admit in song to being rich young boys who aren&#039;t sure if they&#039;re merely playing at revolution or fully committed. More on this when I&#039;m not drunk and if, improbably, you&#039;re interested.]]></description>

Now I think about it, I vaguely remember a bit (which I hope I&#039;ve not wishfully made up) where Eponine does a &quot;...you really don&#039;t get it, do you?&quot; face at Marius &amp; co, and I like to think it&#039;s imbued with slightly more than romantic unrequitedness and also &quot;You boys are a bit clueless&quot; more generally.]]></description>

Again this is based on my reading it at 16 and then drunkenly looking up fanfiction about the hot revolutionaries after seeing the movie, but I&#039;m pretty sure that&#039;s about right. There were definitely Actually Poor People around but I don&#039;t think the excitable young men had any cash flow issues. Which is just darling.]]></description>
