An entirely unenhanced (and happily cake-enjoying) 30HH here! Just flagging up my agreement with this. :) 

Generally my experience is that the majority of retailers do not cater to larger cup sizes. Places which do are often (when it&#039;s an in-house brand like M&amp;S) not great at making adjustments to the design that actually makes the bra fit me properly. I am effectively Bravissimo&#039;s captive market on this - I&#039;d love to write/read something analysing *their* marketing, actually, because it&#039;s very &quot;love your curves&quot; - so far, so predictable - but I&#039;m never 100% sure about it all the same.

I take a 32E in some brands and my assets are due to a love of pie and cake, so I don&#039;t think that women need to have had surgery to fit into small back sizes and large cups. However, I think you might be right about them only stocking sizes which fit the image they are trying to project these days. They are a large enough brand that they could easily afford to offer a wider range than they do.]]></description>

Since I had no intention of buying, I hadn&#039;t bothered to check their sizes.  Now that I do so, I find that the largest knicker size seems to be 14-16.  I checked a random bra, and found what seemed to me a bizarre size range.  It was available 32, 34 or 36, each of those available with a B, C, D or DD cup.  It&#039;s surely hardly a reflection of the female population as a whole.  (I just checked on Marks and Spencer site, and found a very different size range... very much to my relief.)  To take just one of those Agent Provocateur sizes, I wonder how many women fit a 32DD bra without silicon enhancement.

There may be feminist issues around the sizes, in so far as they represent what is considered a &quot;sexy&quot; size to be.  It may be that (as a commercial company) Agent Provocateur produce the sizes for which there is a demand.  On the other hand, the size range they offer is probably at least in part dictated by the image they wish to project.

And... I just wonder what kind of a woman wants a 32DD bra and is prepared to pay £95 for it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I can see why people on Bad Rep are interested in Agent Provocateur -- because it projects powerful images about femininity.

All the same, I find it hard to engage with Agent Provocateur on any level.  It doesn&#039;t seem to have much to do with the world I inhabit.  It is a brand of very expensive underwear.  I wear (an buy) underwear, I expect we all do, and prefer to wear reasonable quality brands.  I usually opt for Marks and Spencers or Sloggi.  But Agent Provocateur knickers (ignoring the thongs) seem to run from £45 a pair to £125.  I wouldn&#039;t consider paying those kind of prices, nor (I feel confident) would anyone in my circle of acquaintance.

Perhaps Agent Provocateur might seem to belong in the real world if I lived in Bankside or Hampstead.  Alas, I actually live in Leytonstone.  Is this a class issue?]]></description>

Hey Lori,

I mention femme because I think the argument against femme is a more sophisticated and inclusive form of the argument against femininity. Most of us can see the problem, in some way or other, with white femininity. But I think those problems are obscured when it&#039;s argued that by introducing an active component, we can make it work for us. That&#039;s the strategy I&#039;m referring to when I say &quot;femme&quot;. I use the word &quot;ironic&quot; to mean a form of expression which includes multiple levels of meaning as well as an intentionality about that multiplicity.

I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a worthless strategy; I understand why many women use it, and I think that if you only think in an individual framework - what&#039;s the best thing that I can do if I&#039;m the only one who does anything, and nobody coordinates their action? - it actually makes good sense. For some people. But I think it also has some limitations on who can do it, and who it most helps. I&#039;m not one of the people who can do it, and I&#039;m not one of the people who considers herself helped by it!

If you&#039;re interested in the reasoning behind my thoughts, I&#039;ve &lt;a href=&quot;http://radtransfem.tumblr.com/post/48268659900/white-femininity-as-signs-of-submission-thoughts-on&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;written them out at more length on my tumblr&lt;/a&gt;, and on where they fit into a framework of sexual liberation in my series on feminist desire, particularly &lt;a href=&quot;http://radtransfem.wordpress.com/2012/12/12/the-prudes-progress-part-iii/#lovingourselves&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://radtransfem.wordpress.com/2013/01/09/the-prudes-progress-part-v/#exorcisingbeauty&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

I like the phrase &#039;bargains with patriarchy&#039; - it sums up what you&#039;re saying perfectly. I can see how/why you have issues with femininity as the bar against which all women (trans or cis) are judged. I have been reading an interesting book on female masculinity that highlights all sorts of issues that women who don&#039;t present as traditionally feminine have to face.

It&#039;s interesting that you mention &#039;femme&#039; because I&#039;d always thought (based on what femme friends have told me about their identity) that it was based on a rejection of traditional femininity and a reclaiming of supposedly feminine things. Therefore, femme is a performance that anyone, regardless of gender, can undertake. I guess it&#039;s not quite that straightforward as you have to be choosing to bend/break these patriarchal rules... does that make femme an &#039;ironic&#039; embracing of femininity? I&#039;m not sure.]]></description>

Thanks for the engaged response, Lori. I worried after leaving my first comment that it had come across too snarky, even though I certainly didn&#039;t mean it that way!

For me it helps to be transsexual in doing this kind of analysis, because that explodes the fictions around femininity. For me and I suspect a lot of trans* women (as well as many others), there&#039;s nothing glamorous about femininity. It&#039;s exposed to us very clearly as brutal hard work which comes at significant cost.

There are all kinds of bargains with patriarchy which some women (e.g. white, judged &quot;thin&quot;, not-visibly-disabled cissexual women) can make which just aren&#039;t available to many of us. I don&#039;t use the word &quot;bargain&quot; to suggest collusion or blame women; I mean it more as making a trade-off for reasons of survival/self-worth. But it&#039;s important that &lt;a href=&quot;http://radtransfem.tumblr.com/post/42928117719/access-to-shitty-bargains-vs-privilege&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;life as a woman is patriarchally designed to only be survivable through making many of those trade-offs, yet not everyone has access to them&lt;/a&gt;.

Dressing up in Agent Provocateur, I suggest, is one of them. A woman gets a certain kind of self-worth, a certain feeling of power, at a certain cost. That&#039;s a bargain she makes. Not all of us can. So I think the cost can be clearer for those of us who can&#039;t make it, because we can see it from the outside with less temptation or confusion.

Femme, for some women, can be playful/fun. But in my case, femme is trying to kill me. Femininity is the standard against which I&#039;m judged and found wanting. Every cissexual and transsexual woman who rejects femininity makes it easier for me and all women to survive by making femininity less compulsory for women as a class. &quot;Ironic&quot; embrace of it sadly doesn&#039;t do much to liberate me from its standards!]]></description>

But it&#8217;s important that <a href="http://radtransfem.tumblr.com/post/42928117719/access-to-shitty-bargains-vs-privilege" rel="nofollow">life as a woman is patriarchally designed to only be survivable through making many of those trade-offs, yet not everyone has access to them</a>.</p>
<p>Dressing up in Agent Provocateur, I suggest, is one of them. A woman gets a certain kind of self-worth, a certain feeling of power, at a certain cost. That&#8217;s a bargain she makes. Not all of us can. So I think the cost can be clearer for those of us who can&#8217;t make it, because we can see it from the outside with less temptation or confusion.</p>
<p>Femme, for some women, can be playful/fun. But in my case, femme is trying to kill me. Femininity is the standard against which I&#8217;m judged and found wanting. Every cissexual and transsexual woman who rejects femininity makes it easier for me and all women to survive by making femininity less compulsory for women as a class. &#8220;Ironic&#8221; embrace of it sadly doesn&#8217;t do much to liberate me from its standards!</p>
