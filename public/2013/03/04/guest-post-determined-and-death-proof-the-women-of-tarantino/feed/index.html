					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Note for Life: If you&#8217;re going to argue with someone with a cult following like Quentin Tarantino, wear an unobtrusive hat because you do yourself no favours. I don&#8217;t feel this woman was allowed to make her point. Also, here&#8217;s a nice feminist breakdown of female characters in the work of QT. [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re really spot-on with this article.  Tarantino&#039;s not the model, but he&#039;s definitely got some attributes worth paying attention to as a director.

I always see the first half of death proof as a sort of meta-literature review, an introduction to psycho movies for a potentially uninformed audience.  I&#039;m not sure it&#039;s at all necessary, though, especially when Death Proof is only half of Grindhouse, it&#039;s probably one metalevel too many.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post. Personally my fave Tarantino gal is Jackie Brown, she is a brilliant characters with a full personality - she is nuanced and subtle as well as bold and brash. Plus she completely makes the movie!]]></description>

Yes, Go-Go was compelling and terrifying.  Also she&#039;s very young (without re-watching the film to check, my recollection is 17).  She ought to have her whole murderous life ahead of her.  Her death was, for me, maybe the most shocking moment in the film.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s one thing with which I take issue in this post.  Of Uma Thurman&#039;s role in the Kill Bill films:

&quot;And she’s not the only strong woman in the film (although she’s the only one you’re rooting for).&quot;

In fact, I found myself rooting (to some extent) for several of her opponents.  Go-Go was one such.  I was hoping that, somehow, they would both survive.]]></description>
