					<description><![CDATA[I really liked the film but a few things could have been done better. 
I don&#039;t get why Tiffany (Jen Lawrence) is attracted to Pat (Bradley Cooper). He is so self absorbed and he does not treat Tiffany particularly well. She at least has some grounding and you think she could do better than falling for the &#039;Nikki obsessed&#039; Pat. 

I agree that Pat&#039;s salivating at Tiffany&#039;s description of her sexual experiences was too much an easy cheap shot by the director Russell, instead perhaps Pat could been respectful and shown that he does have an understanding side, giving Tiffany an actual reason to maybe find him attractive.]]></description>
