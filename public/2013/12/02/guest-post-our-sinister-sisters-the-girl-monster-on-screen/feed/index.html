					<description><![CDATA[This is an excellent post but, having recently re-watched Cat People, I really don&#039;t think that Alice is intended to be Irena&#039;s husband&#039;s (Tom&#039;s) mistress.  Alice and Tom are work colleagues, and they work late together, Irena suspects them of having sex (clearly) but I think that she&#039;s mistaken.  It seems to me that my reading is confirmed by the sort-of-sequel Curse of the Cat People (which I also watched recently).  In Curse of the Cat People, Alice and Tom are married, and are raising a little girl.  Within the conventions of the time, I can&#039;t see that this would happen if Alice had involved herself in pre-marital sex.  Even today, in the cinema, pre-marital sex seems to debar young women from becoming the last girl.

Curse of the Cat People attracts a lot less attention than Cat People, but is worth watching in its own right.  It&#039;s more a study in child psychology than a horror film, but none the worse for that.

Neither of the Cat People films have been released as UK DVDs.  They&#039;re available on Region 2, though, from the continent.  Cat People has been released in France as La Feline (with an accent over the first e, which I don&#039;t know how insert in this place).  There&#039;s also a slightly inferior Italian DVD almost worth buying for the title alone -- Il Bacio Della Pantera.  Curse of the Cat People may be had on an excellent Italian DVD entitled Il Giardino Della Streghe.]]></description>
