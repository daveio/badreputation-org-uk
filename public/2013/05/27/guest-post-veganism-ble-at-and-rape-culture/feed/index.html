					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for this. I&#039;m a vegan and I loathe the &#039;rape rack&#039;, dairy and all the other components of our animal-abuse culture. But the way PETA uses sexism, body fascism and racism to put their point across is the most vile of ethical hypocrisies and I don&#039;t want to be associated with it at all. Thank you for putting all this into such a coherent and well-researched article.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A compelling article, very well written and researched. I&#039;m glad to be reading something that highlights the culture of rape and blame existing in our society every day, and PETA are way, way out of line!]]></description>
