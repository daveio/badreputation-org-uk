					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for that.  It helps to further convince me not to watch any films of this sort.  Out of curiosity, I recorded one from late night TV (I think it was one of the Saw series) but never watched it.  In my younger days, I was a big fan of horror films.  At risk of showing my age, that was in the heyday of Hammer.  Quite a lot of the 1950s to 1970s horror films, on DVD, now carry a 12 certificate.  They seem to belong to a more innocent, and less violently misogynist, age.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am so ready to read part two of this!

I first found Eli Roth via Inglourious Basterds, and literally only just unfollowed the guy on Twitter this morning because his feed is literally just him retweeting everyone who says he&#039;s a horror genius.  And, um, obviously I&#039;m the barometer of who&#039;s cool on Twitter. 

This is a super write-up of what I suspected would go on in Hostel and I&#039;m pretty glad I avoided it.  I&#039;m thinking of checking out his new werewolf offering though, because apparently the transformation sequences are brutal as hell.  But I&#039;ve heard that his gender politics is terrible in it :/  Can I brave it for werewolves?  Let&#039;s see...]]></description>
