					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2013/02/02/deep-silver-dead-island-and-conversation-piece/#comment-22527&quot;&gt;Seb&lt;/a&gt;.

I was going to post something about the Venus de Milo originally being sculptured with arms.  She represents a goddess, dammit.  The word &#039;goddess&#039; has been devalued in such phrases as &#039;domestic goddess&#039;.  A couple of thousand years of the deity being depicted in exclusively male form may make the concept alien to many, not least those who voted against the creation of women bishops, but at one time divinity could be of either sex.

As to the repellent object which is the subject of this post, I&#039;m sure that we can all agree that it reveals a particularly hideous form of misogyny.  It may be less obvious that it is, even in its own terms, very poorly sculpted.  I don&#039;t believe that anyone ever had breasts that shape.  I assume that the sculptor (to allow him that title) has spent a great deal of time looking at depictions of the human female breast.  (It&#039;s hard to believe otherwise.)  Yet, however long he has spent gawping at them, he&#039;s failed to notice the shape they are.  Breasts aren&#039;t like two balls placed on the chest.  They start right up by the shoulders.  One might think that if someone looks for long enough, they would see.  Not necessarily, it seems. Objectification is a very strange process.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Classicist weighing in to assure you that Greek and Roman art wasn&#039;t just torsos because they couldn&#039;t be bothered with the rest of the body. They made the whole body and often outcroppings such as limbs/heads wings were lost to time and vandalism. The Venus de Milo originally had arms. She still has her goddamn head. So yeah, the whole tits and ass thing is basically just our culture. So proud.]]></description>
