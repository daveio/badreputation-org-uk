You should read his run on Journey into Mystery. If you can avoid spoilers about the ending, all the better.

It also sets up one of the characters in Young Avengers, but isn&#039;t necessary for reading YA.]]></description>

Phonogram is very good. Especially the new volume, The Singles Club. That&#039;s better than the initial volume, I think.]]></description>

They obviously do have a concept of gender roles. It&#039;s just that for a Skrull those roles are far more fluid and open to change than in our less developed and nuanced human gender.]]></description>

The Skrulls have no notion of &quot;queer&quot; in any sense of the word usage. On panel it&#039;s been described as &quot;We change our gender as easy as you humans change your hair colour&quot;. Their shapeshifting is such a part of their culture that gender roles and norms (by earth standards) don&#039;t feature in their society.

...and there goes the geekiest thing I&#039;ve written this week. :)]]></description>
