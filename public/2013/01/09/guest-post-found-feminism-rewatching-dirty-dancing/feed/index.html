I think Johnny finally uses her real name at the end when he gives his speech, and that&#039;s sort of a turning point. Very rusty memory though!]]></description>

IIRC, her name is actually Frances. Baby is a nickname given to her by her family, because she is the youngest. I *think* she ditches this name by the end of the film too.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve always loved the movie Dirty Dancing, and was reminded of just how much more than a dance movie it is when I was summarising the plot for a friend. I&#039;d never really considered it from a feminist perspective before (which is odd, seeing as I wrote about Grease in a similar way for The F-Word a few years ago!), but I love your critique. The class aspect is fascinating and the interaction between the female characters is great... despite the fact a lot of the conversatins are about men!

Thanks for a really enjoyable post.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I thought I&#039;d seen &#039;Dirty Dancing&#039;, and am surprised to discover that I haven&#039;t.  The film I thought was &#039;DD&#039; is set in Australia, and has a completely different storyline.

So, everything I now know about &#039;DD&#039; is gleaned from this post.  As I read it, the elephant in the room that kept leaping out at me (except that elephants don&#039;t leap a great deal) is that the lead character seems to be called Baby.  The implied infantilisation repeatedly distracted me from the main thrust of the post -- as though someone were scratching a blackboard as I read.]]></description>
